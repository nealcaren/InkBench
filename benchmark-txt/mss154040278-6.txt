Jean fed us Alda attended the 
League of W. Voters and I dodged around 
among them and along toward 
night bought a blue dress and 
received a caller.
I'm hoping the war will end
in the South East and that the Greeks 
in their white pettys will chase the 
Nazis home where at least one 
will commit suicide.
When we meet again I will 
not be so clean as you are.
Like Mary Wollstonecraft you will 
be "A Shining Woman"
Looking forward
