Hon. Fred Douglass.
Sir:

I have the honor to forward to
you the published action of the Ebenezer
Lyceum, as directed; and ask your
acceptance of the same as a token of love
and respect for our great acknowledged
leader. 

For the Good of the Whole People.
 
The Ebenezer Lyceum had an interesting
meeting yesterday afternoon, Rev.E.S. Atkinson,
president, and A.E. Ryder, secretary.
After the reading of an essay, singing
of a duet, and listening to an address,
the following was adopted:
Whereas it is a duty we owe to every citizen
to express our grateful thanks for any and
every intelligent and virtuous act of public
interest and benefit done for the good of the
community; and
Whereas the Hon. Frederick Douglass has,
during a long life of public service, been conspicuous
in the sound and wholesome advice
and words of wisdom spoken with honest
courage for the good of the whole people and
his country; now therefore
Resolved, That in the recent address delivered
by Mr. Douglass before a large audience
under the auspices of the Bethel Literary Association
we recognize in him our beloved and
honored leader, who has honestly spoken our
sentiments and fairly presented the cause of
the colored citizens of our country to the
general public for consideration.
Resolved, That we tender to Mr. Douglass
our heartfelt thanks for his very able and
timely address, in which we proudly recognize
statesmanship, philosophy, and manly
courage unsurpassed.
Resolved, That in Hon. Frederick Douglass
we recognize our own true and beloved
leader--ever faithful and wise. We heartily
indorse the words he has spoken, the statement
he has made, and we pledge him our 
loyal devotion and support.
Resolved, That the President be, and he is
hereby, authorized to tender the congratulations
of this association to Mr. Douglass and
present him with a copy of the foregoing preamble
and resolutions. 

Respectfully, 
E.S. Atkinson
Prest
