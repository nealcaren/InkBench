that put it there brings
it to the active state, & 
nearly ends me. I 
think a month of Illinois would 
be good for a tombstone at 
the end.
Wisconsin looks 
delightfully fresh, & 
clean, & green, & rolling,
& I begin to feel better
at once.
I will write my 
dear little neglected Maumee
often now & - with love to 
all the house, - I send 
her my heart.

get my Maumee's screed, written 
by her own blessed little claw, at Aurora*]
