My dear daughter.- Miss
Mack came yesterday
and brought the box and
visited with me awhile.
she said she had a nice
trip up and working at
home and clearing away
weeds in the back and
the like.
We were very glad
to talk with you Sunday-
night.  It help Parks, feel
better. We are doing very
well at present.  Brother
and family are quite 
well.  he doesn't come so
often now. is still working 
out at Jackson. and 
they are getting welfare
help.  I hope you are well
and wont over work before 
you come home.
Now that School is out I 
suppose some of the children 
will be over to stay.
Much love from Mother
