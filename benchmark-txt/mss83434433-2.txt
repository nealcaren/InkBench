Dear Sir, 
I have thought of an expedient to bring
in Carolina which I submit to you. It is this Gene
Mosely is mastering his force to leave for Mississippi,
Now if you could disperse with Janet + see Gene all
+ let her go + slay his negros + get it out that he has bought
her - it would I am sure bring her in  - let it be out
that it is an arrangement of mere over which you have
no control: What do you think of it? Let me know
Yrs truly,
John H. Levy
Mr. O Neile
