All this to acquire necessary experience & to be
believed by those I would help, that I fully know 
their trouble & could not but make common cause
with them — I so it is but a blessing in disguise!
And now let me add that Easter eve I
was sought by Mr. James, the Director of Hume Institute 
mentioned in [???ed] papers — to tell me he had
proof that "Philanthropic money" as he called it would
be found in the north (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for [such] such work as I had hinted 
& to which he added the suggestion mentioned 
and attracted my attention to Past & Paget of the
Daily Inter-Ocean of Chicago 25 March No. giving an account
of a successful coloured colonization at Tuskegee
Alabama — to which I refer you also as one to interest
you — (It is a number of 62 pages printed  at 
immense no. of copies as its 21st anniversary & which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair.) When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion of my sketch & counsel how best to proceed

I feel one of your sympathy for the cause & 
perhaps "for auld lang syne" so remain, hopefully
& with my very best wishes of the season for your
continued prosperity, dear Sir

most truly yours
F. S. Guthrie d'Arusmont (*X*)
