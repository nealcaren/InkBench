Dear Mrs. Brown;
     I can't let your note about Miss Bladswell go unanswered, even if the checks I would like to send must be omitted.
     I have always admired Miss Bladswell, and, in late years, have loved her especially. Her always beautiful Christmas and Easter messages, and her undoubtable spiritual grace are such lovely additions to the great back-ground of her life work.
     It worries my heart to know that she, too, is facing a financial vacuum. 
There are so many who are! I am one of them myself, or of course I would share in making the fund which you are making. Being a starving artist is a most painful handicap, in every way, but it is particularly hard to endure, when appeals like this come.
     Thank you for including me as one of her friends. - which I most certainly am.
              
                                                                                             Sincerely,
                                                                                             Mary Ware Dennett
