I think you would be sorry for my mother were you to see her now. Her body lives but her mental powers are badly impaired. The care of her is onerous at times, for she is in the border land between sanity and imbecility, and cannot yet be left to other hands than mine. She is quite an aged woman - seventy five years old.
And yet, bad as it is, it is in some ways easier than the relations between us used to be. She has no power any more to spoil my life, and patience is comparatively easy, because of the pitifulness of her present condition.

My youngest brother, and able fellow, of unusual promise, never very robust, became a physician. He had a brilliant professional future before him, when owing to mental strain and overwork, his health gave way. He fell a victim to that dreadful disease locomotor taxia.
He cannot live in New York. The last winter we were in Madison Square was a very trying one in regard to weather, and a very bad one to us, as we were feeling keenly our recent bereavement in the sudden death of my oldest brother's sweet young wife, who had endeared herself to all our hearts in quite a remarkable manner.
