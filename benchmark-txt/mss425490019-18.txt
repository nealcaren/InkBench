May 1914

My own dear Brother Robert: 

I was late getting 
the news that is 
why my congratulations 
are late reaching you.

My dear Brother 
you don't know 
how glad I am that 
this great honor 
has come to you 
and you deserve 
it all. 'Tis a real 
achievement for 
the race. The 
papers have been 
so complimentary
