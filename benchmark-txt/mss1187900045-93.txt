we make sure of a more
blissful meeting where
farewells are never said.
I remember how much you
dear Frederick dislike sermons
but- but- let me say, for
myself that I never found
my dear Savior so near nor
so precious as now. Amidst
the many trials & heart rendings-
& disappointments I
have gone through I can
realize that "all things"
must win & are working
together for good- & when
we reach yonder glorious
city, we shall dear dear
friend, be enabled to "look
back on all the way the
Lord our God has led us to
humble us- & prove us".
May our loving Heavenly Father
bless you for ever prays
your ever faithful and
affectionate friend
