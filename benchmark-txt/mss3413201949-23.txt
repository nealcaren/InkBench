(1) The senseless Waste of War
When the great War began $7 billions of old War debts 
stood upon the books of Europe. The total coin money 
& bullion in circulation in the whole world was about 
eleven billions of dollars. Yet the nations plunged 
pell mell into the war, borrowing all they could, 
printing paper money, & not stopping to count the 
cost. At the end the international debts were so 
complicated & burdensome that a universal panic 
followed. What senseless waste! Any wonder they 
can not pay their debts to us?
Do you know that every man killed in the late 
War cost the living $17800?
Let me read you a little dialogue, an extract from 
a conversation between a king & his prime minister, 
in the 3rd century before Christ. Cyneas-Pyrrhus

2  When we the people so will.
When the generation that has not experienced 
War ceases to see & hear & read the glories of War 
but know the facts & refuse to repeat such 
history - when women refuse the glamor of 
war trappings, war music, war propaganda 
& take intelligent stand in elections.
