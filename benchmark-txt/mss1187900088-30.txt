FIRST ANNUAL ASSEMBLY, LAKE JACKSON, LEON COUNTY. FLORIDA.
Columbia, Tenn.
Nov. 5th 1889.

Hon. Frederick Douglass,
My honored sir: --
We respectfully call
your attention to our letter head and also
take great pleasure in informing you of the
hopeful progress this move is making.
As far as is practicable the leading men of letters
of our race have been conferred with, and up
to date, out of the many responses received, not
one has withheld endorsement and active
cooperation.

The plan is to have the Chautauqua hold its first
meeting in Fla, that being near the center of
the "Carthaginian Belt."

At first the Chautauqua is to be intinary as to
place of meeting. The aim is to gradually
work up to the limits of the famed New York
Chautauqua.

"All beginnings are hard,"  The peculiar state
of popular opinion regarding our people here
