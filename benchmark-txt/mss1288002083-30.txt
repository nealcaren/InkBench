The Smith sisters of Glastonbury have
lately parted with a share of bank stock and
two of their pet Alderneys, rather than pay
their taxes in the regular way, in our present
depreciated currency. But the Worcester
Fosters, Stephen S. and Abby Kelly,
who have been refusing to pay their taxes
for several years, because Abby was not allowed
to vote, have clearly got sick of the
martyr business. And no wonder, for it
was rather expensive, and the public has
been more disposed to poke fun at, than to
sympatize with, the "sufferers." The Worcester
authorities have treated the Foster
couple with great forbearance,-recognizing
that, owing to rather maddled
ideas of the theory of taxation,
they really belived they were vindicating
a principle in refusing payment.
The fallacy of their idea, as The UNION has
often shown, rests upon the entirely mis-
taken notion that taxation is connected with
the right of suffrage or anyway, dependent
on it. The world was taxed six thousand
years before suffrage was invented, and the
citizens of countries where suffrage does not
exist are taxed to day without a thought of
protest. Minors are taxed, non-residents
are taxed, and universally, ia the theory and
practice of civilized and uncivilized governments
taxation is recognized as the fair contribution
of the citizen to the expenses of
the government whose protection and conveniences
he enjoys. Not to pay taxes is a
fraudulent evasion of a fair debt.
