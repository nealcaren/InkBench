feel that I am growing old,
am not now what I have
been - although time has
been quite generous with
me - you will see by
this letter that it harder
for me to write now then
in old times when my 
nerves is was steady
and strong - Give my
kind regards to your
wife in which my good Ruth
hartily joins - Excuse this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend and wellwisher

James N. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see
us - I say Amen. You have 
now an engagement not
fulfilled.   J.N.B
