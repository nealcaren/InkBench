Dictated              11-20-'36
My Dear Mrs. Catt:
Am in 
the General Hospital, Osteopathic 
Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, at the 
present with a fractured leg. 
Have been here 8 weeks today. 
Hope soon to be released from 
this terrible home of torture, a 
cast, so that I can return 
to my little apartment at 
609 Fairview Ave, So. Pasadena 
Calif. Many friends are wonderful 
to me in many ways.
   Address my close friend 
Mrs. Lois Jenkins, 1718 
Oak St., So Pasadena - who has 
all [???] of me in charge.
Cordially,
Henrietta G Moore
