Friday Mar 8
My dear Friend
Yours from Ithaca
I sent to Wâ€” because I 
understand you were to
be there at just that time
And I could not have
met you. I was sick
and so was Mrs L. I was very
much "disappointed" too
but so glad you and Mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
I do "take all care of my
self for that future is in 
hopes, but this weather kills
me if it was one long summer
