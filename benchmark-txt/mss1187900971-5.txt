Grandpa was never called "Lloyd"  
He was first Frederick Bailey - the slave 
changed to Johnson when he ran 
away and because the man in 
whose home he lived in New Bedford, 
Mass. was named Johnson, this man 
who had just finished reading 
"The Lady of the Lake" admired 
so much the character in the 
book named "Douglass" asked 
Grandpa - to keep from conflicting 
their two Johnson names, how he  
would like to call himself 
Douglass instead of Johnson. 
Grandpa told him one name to him 
was as good as another and henceforth 
set out to be called 
Frederick Douglass.

These are facts - not hearsay. 

Later - Just rec'd. letter from Fred - he 
leaves on his "debating tour" to day - 
and really debates at Howard.  He 
will stop with Ora.  I've already written
 Joe's wife & Mammie and sent Ora word.
