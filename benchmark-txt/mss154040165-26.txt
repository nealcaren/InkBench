Captains Instrustions and some Denison craft paper
describing the two varieties. She didn't get any thing
My letter W Chin(?) Cain. Distnels(?) definitely stated they
could have the Instructions at $3 per 100. Just why
any one in that office shouldn't know crepe paper
is a mystery. I should think they might think
the campaign consisted mostly of paper designs
The usual is that Rochester didn't get its headquarters
decorated for May 2. and the Captains
gathered for my Conference couldn't take the
decorations home with them. That is a long
way from efficiency. Please see what is
the matter and who doesn't know crepe
paper. I could scarcely believe her.
