department but have not received an answer yet. I expect one to night. It has been beautiful weather ever since you left and I do not think we will have much snow but it will be keen and sharp. Elizabeth is making preparations to read her lecture next Monday night and leave us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. I believe she has not made any of her appointments yet but I think to day or tomorrow Lewis will attend to it. I am writing in a great deal of noise and confusion being in the schoolroom and the few who have brought their dinners are as full of glee as possible. I hope you will have as comfortable a time as possible and that you will not return home sick. Old Brown will have to keep out of sight for a little while the Governor of Missouri has a reward of $6,000 offered for his capture1 and Hamilton has given himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love And enclosed you will find a note from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie3 will send a few lines.
