[*Loving Thoughts from Rosa*]
We are fairly on our way.
The ships and the rooms seem 
satisfactory. We left promptly
in time and will be stopping
in Cherbourg this evening
evening when this will get
mailed.  All is well with us
and you will get a letter before
we are over.  It is very cold today -
nothing tropical about it - Lovingly
