if you will but keep
the eye of your own
spirit turned within - 
for it is [from] within
(not without) that [?]
the precious jewel of 
truth & sight is to 
be sought - & formed -
And darling - you 
will find it, & [?]
it, and live it - and
all men & women shall
call you blessed -
 hastily but oh so dearly
Susan B. Anthony
