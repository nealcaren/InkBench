life and escape from bondage 
for me to sell saying, if I sold
them I should have one volume
to keep for my reward I think
I sold ten volumes.  They were
published by Joseph Barker
of Leeds Yorkshire.  I kept my
book untill 1857 and some
one stole it and never have
I seen one like it since.
The remembrance of all the 
above notes prompts me to 
solicit you and your wife to
a trial visit.  I have been
searching for days to find out
your abiding home and failed
correctly to get it untill yesterday.
And now a line from you will
give me pleasure to say when,
where, and at what time you can 
recieve a call from me on yourself
and wife (whom I have not met)
our homes were not far apart Salem Ohio
Do you Remember Benjamin Brown & wife
old anti slavery stand byes.  They had an under
ground daughter she married John Deming
My brokers daughter is married to her son
at Salem Ohio.  The Demings have an exhibit
in Manufacturing Hall.  My husband has been
ill and have not yet got to the Fair.  Saw
you through my glass on Dedication day in
October.  Awaiting your early answer with best
wishes. Truly yours Mrs. Henrietta Harris
