I think that is quite unusual 
for a seventeen year 
old boy. So if you would send 
it to me someday, I would 
be very happy indeed.
Please remember me to Miss 
Wilson & Miss Peck and be 
sure to let me know if they 
or you come to Washington.
With affectionate greetings
Gratefully yours,
Florence H. Darby
