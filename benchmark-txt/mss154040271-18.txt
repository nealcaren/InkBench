Dear Mary:
I received a book yesterday - the 27th
gift this spring! If this book tells how to attain
success with a book when the author (would be)
has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary
to express the feeble thoughts she has, it will be most
welcome. Until I have read it I shall not know
whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or
without thanks either way! I am sending you
a tiny box of left over seeds. This is no gift. I just
had them left. I haven't the remotest idea
what any of them are, but we will find out.
If you were nearer I should have given you
a garden full of plants from the greenhouse,
all of which will either die in my garden or
give withered little blossoms. They would have
been stalwart wonders in yours. When you
come down, I shall take you to see a garden
that is worth looking at.
