Dear Papa + Mamma,

Yesterday we went on a pleasant picnic to Fitch Bay. It was an all-day trip. We had an early breakfast, + then the Holbrooks came over, + we all piled into a little stream-launch, chartered for the occasion. It carries 25, + there were 25 of us. The engine divides it in the middle, with wood heaped up on each side (fancy a steam engine turn by wood!) + the back 

[*was pretty, too. Bessie is his favorite, but she is more of a romp + less of a young lady than Sadie. I am well. Sorry to think it is getting so near the end. Lots of love.

[?] A.S.P.
Sophie put her hat on Mr. Barrows, + you ought to have seen him*]
