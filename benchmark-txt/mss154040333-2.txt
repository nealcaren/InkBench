Dear Mrs. Chapman Catt,
I just finished the superb look 
on the great work you have
accomplished during your
wonderfully active life!
This book is a grand inspiration
for all of us in every country
I was deeply moved by the pages
on your international work, and
the meetings in Geneva, few of
which I was fortunate enough
