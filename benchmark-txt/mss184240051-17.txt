Does my Maum
know this Marylander?
His wife did evidently
not believe in the old
English law concerning
the "corrections" of  a
husband.

Did Dickey mail the letter I 
sent her? I forgot to ask.  Love to 
her.  My whole heart to my

The Light in the Tunnel.
From the [?] City Chronicle.
A new device for the bedevilment of lovers
was operated successfully by a heartless young man on
the local train yesterday.  A couple sat in the seat before
him. The lady was young and modest, and the swain
wore very large cuffs. One arm was thrown carelessly
along the back of the seat, and upon this the evil-minded
person behind rubbed some phosphorus. The affectionate
performances of that cuff, when the train was rushing
through the kindly darkness of the tunnels, were beheld 
by all the unfeeling and snickering occupants of
the car, whose cruel enjoyment was not a little increased by
the demure and unconcerned appearance of the lovers 
each time the train bounded again into light.

The wife of Thomas H. Benner of Hagerstown
had been warned before she married him that his 
temper was violent, and that, sooner or later, he would
whip her. She seems to have made up her mind what to 
do if he struck her, for when he did so, she drew a revolver
from her pocket and shot him dead.
