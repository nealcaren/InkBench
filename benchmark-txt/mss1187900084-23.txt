that all thoughtful people, all
who have the good of the African 
race at heart will agree with
you in the soundly philosophical
view you have taken of
 the subject. Can your address
be published in pamphlet
form? If so, I shall order
some for circulation. There is
not a word or thought in it
that I would have changed
in any respect. Again I beg to
thank you for laying before the 
American people so valuable 
and timely an address. I wish
you would send a copy to 
our common friend Cyrus
[McNeely] Hopedale Harrison Co.
Ohio He is of the old abolitionists


of Ohio, of whom so few
are left and please put some
mark on it by which he will know
from whom he receives it.
                                            
Do you
ever come west in these days?
Should you come to this city
remember you have a Carte 
Blanche, which if you follow it,
will take you to my house
86 North Prospect St

Faithfully Yours
