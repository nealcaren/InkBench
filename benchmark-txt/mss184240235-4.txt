My dear Miss Dickenson

That you should last even'g have
experienced any inconvenience whatever
has been to me a cause of much regret, yet
can I  not advise that the responsibility therefor
rests at all in me. My position in regard
to succession to the presidential chair
is as well known as that of almost any
other person in the city, and I cannot ????
regard it as having been a great mistake
on the part of your friends that they should
have urged upon me in any measure to 
sanction or lecture the whole drift of 
which was to be indirect opposition to 
my own published views. .
In the very brief conversation which
preceeded my release you expressed surprise
that I should have known known nothing of a lecture
that you had delivered at Cooper Institute
six months before and since more than
once repeated. - The fact, nevertheless, was
so, as I had then, and have now, no
recollection of having even read a single
line of any lecture at all resembling that
which, as I learn, you delivered last 
even'g and at which delivery I was expected 
to preside. - Such was the
