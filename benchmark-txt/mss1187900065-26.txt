dear Sir

I yesterday deposited with the Surrogate of Hudson 
Co. New Jersey,  the Will of the late Ottilia Assing, along 
with a letter from me declining to serve as Executor, 
copies of which I forward to you with this. 

You will please take such action in 
the matter of supplying a substitute, as you deem proper, 
and believe me.

Yours with great respect,
Henry Bergh
