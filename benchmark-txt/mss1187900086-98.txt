Massachusetts Women Suffrage Association,
3 PARK STREET. 
Boston, July 21 1889.

Dear Frederick Douglas
     When we first saw your
appointment to Hayti - and also how
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you
I began to clip and stick them with 
the intention of sending them all on 
to you - I cut "lots" of them - but alas!
in the huge piles of Editorial scraps
they have all disappeared but these
I Enclose.

It was pleasant to see the 
appreciation in which you are held.
While you are alive to see it.
I am not sure that we are glad
to have you go - We need you 
here.
