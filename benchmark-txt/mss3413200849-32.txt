of tearing out the structure of the 
old humanly operated one - motors, cables, 
masonry, cage and all - and installing 
the new automatic - we are to have
no service whatever? A letter from the Renting 
Agent received yesterday informs us 
to [that] the effect that the complete 
shut-down may last far more than 
the minimum of two weeks estimated by 
the firm in charge of the work - its policy 
being to accept more contracts than it can put
through except by "staggering" the labor - that is by 
sending men now here and now there for a 
couple or more days at a time leaving motors 
incapacitated [an] or dangerous to operate in the 
meantime!!! You can imagine what this means and


You may have already 
seen - If so, just 
destroy them - This one -

as particularly lovely. 
I wonder if 
you knew 
Dr. Lewi....? 
     Have I told 
you that since 
May 1st we

of the process


MEMORIAL SET UP 
TO DR. EMILY LEWI
     Friends of the late Dr. Emily 
Lewi presented a check for $14,000 
yesterday to the trustees of the 
New York Infirmary to start an 
endowment fund in her memory. 
Income will be used for the care of 
ailing women physicians connected 
with the infirmary and their children. 
     The check was presented to Mrs. 
Frank A Vanderlip, president of 
the board of trustees, by Dr. 
Marion Manter, medical director of 
the infirmary, at the end of a 
meeting with the trustees in the 
Fuller building, 597 Madison Avenue. 
     Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Lewi: 
"She was one of the older doctors 
who had the courage of their convictions 
and the consecration to 
uphold the infirmary as a center 
of training and service by women
doctors. Without her work and 
that of her associates the infirmary 
would long since have closed its 
doors." 
     Dr.  Lewi, who died two years 
ago, was a pediatrician who practiced 
more than fifty years and 
served as director of pediatrics at 
the infirmary from 1930 to 1936.
She was known as an outstanding 
teacher and diagnostician and was 
one of the pioneers in endocrinology. 
     One room in the projected new 
infirmary building will be known 
as the Emily Lewi Memorial 
Room, the trustees said, and the 
endowment will support it.
