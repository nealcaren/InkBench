Translation of Dr. Moreau's letter of December 20th, 1921

[* Argentine *]

Dear Mrs. Catt:-

I did not reply immediately to your last letter because 
I wished to send you [several inquiries] [information] on the steps we have taken with our
Government.

We have obtained copy of the telegram sent by Dr. Le Breton
Argentine Minister to Washington, [since] [then than] ours sent to our government by the
United States Legation here.  In both communications it is established
that the Congress is not official and that consequently the delegates
cannot be official. 

We are awaiting the response that our Government will 
make to the demand that we have made to aid us in bearing the expenses of
the delegation, because the $500., of which the note of the [Embassy] of
the United States speaks, is absolutely insufficient, as the price of the
passage [to go] alone, is a little less than $450.  We would like to know whether 
each delegation is expected to bear its hotel and transportation expenses
in the United States. 

I hope that we shall obtain the support of the government;
we shall communicate the result to you immediately.

I urge that we may receive as soon as it is possible
all publicity that you may have on the Congress, in order that the names
of other South American delegates may be published in our press. 

I[n] my next letter I will tell you whether I can go
myself to the Congress, as it is my greatest desire to do so.

I hope to have soon the pleasure of seeing you;  and
in the meantime accept the expression of my best wishes.

Alicia Moreau
