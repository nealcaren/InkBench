Dear Cousin Alice:
When Ethel went
to Huntington I went out to
spend the day - Now it 
was about two weeks after she
had gone that I went! - She had failed
steadily - I spoke to Horace
& said that perhaps I had
better write you for I then
realized that she had
cancer & that she could
not get well - Horace
said that he had told 
Howard & that he would
[*She longed to go - Your loving Cousin Mary
She would 
not have 
wanted 
you to worry
all 
these
weeks, 
I feel
sure*]
