I know a good speech when I 
hear it !!!  I wont take 
his opinion when I'm about 
surely I prefer mine where I 
have the same chance to judge 
as he. 
I don't know why you 
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter from my western 
friend but I enclose a
copy. 
                     Goodbye
                          again
                     with heartiest
            wishes for your health
            specially if you think of 
            facing the rigor of a 
            New England Summer next
            July -
