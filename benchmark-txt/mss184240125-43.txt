     I came to Boston in Nov. to
make a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone.  I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times.  I have
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly.  My heart is not broken, does
not break easily.  I thought I should
see you here this spring, because the papers
said so.  It has been a trying winter,
but spring & violets are near the door.
  Agie writes me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work will do itself.
but if she is shut in, she so hates
in-door "duties" - that she frets, the harnets
chafes.  she has a good- practical man, to
keep her from ding unheard of things.  Taint'
easy.  God bless you dear - always.
   Lovingly - Mama Leay.
