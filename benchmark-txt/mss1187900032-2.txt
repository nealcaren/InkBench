supper we all went in the woods
to skate and skated untill 1/2 past
eight when I came in and
am sitting down to drop a few
lines home they all have condem
me for not bringing my skates
with me and if it is convenient
I wish that you would have them
sent with my other things. I must
cut this letter short as it is almost
bedtime and we must be up
at five oclock I should like to 
hear from home once in a while
and you shall here from me
I know this is not as good
writing as you would to see
but I am in haste so good
night
From your affectionate
son Charles R. Douglass
