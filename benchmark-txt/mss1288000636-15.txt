Nempa back on the farms were
talking in favor of federal milk
control in secondary markets. During
recent months it has become
apparent that state control in markets
where out-of-state milk is imported
in volume was not enough.
     Despite the fact that efficient operation
of federal and state control
agencies, working in cooperation, is
likely to lessen somewhat the need
for producer associations, there
should be no worry lest the control
agencies would put the cooperatives
out of business. Control administrators
have publicly stated that
farmer associations were essential
for the smooth operation of the 
dairy industry.
     It now appears that the revised
Boston milk marketing agreement,
being written under AAA auspices,
may never reach a final, acceptable
form. The various parties to the
writing of the agreement seem determined
that they shall not be
forced to concede an inch. In view
of the fact that Administrator Samuel 
W.  Tator has reminded New 
England that the agreement is
purely voluntary and that he will
eventually tire in his efforts to secure
the agreement, such tactics are
foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow
     Seven Germans were sentenced to
prison the other day for listening
to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two
of them having their sentences
lengthened to four years for the additional
offense of discussing politics
while the broadcast was going
on.
     To most people who have ever
happened to "pick up Moscow" this
will seem a high price to pay for
either the instruction or the entertainment
offered. But the same
would be true of broadcasts from
Berlin or Rome whenever these desert
Mozart and Verdi for the arid
wastes of propaganda.
     Whether Russians are being sent
to jail for tuning in on the fuehrer,
or the duce, has not been reported,
but it is hard to imagine any government
being put in danger by the
dreary stuff that is being broadcast
in prodigious quantities for
consumption abroad. It would save
all the dictators much trouble simply
to let the broadcasts cancel out,
assuming, for example, that Russian
broadcasts do no more damage 
in Germany than German broadcasts
are doing in Russia.
     To admit, by police action, that
this is not the case seems like a 
tacit admission of inferiority in this
kind of warfare. If Dr. Goebbels
has not yet managed to bring the
radio armament of Germany up to
the Russian level of efficiency it is 
time for a shakeup in the ministry
of propaganda.

American and French
Bombing Planes
     The description of 24 French
bombing planes now being hurried
to completion near Paris and 
claimed to be the biggest of their
type in the world, invites comparison
with the United State's army's
Boeing bomber recently destroyed
at Dayton, O. With a wing spread
of 108 feet the French planes apparently
justify, by a small margin,
the claim as to size. But the
232-miles-an-hour average which 
the Boeing plane maintained for
the nonstop flight from Seattle to
Dayton makes the French planes
seem laggards, 12 being designed
for a maximum of 180 miles and 12
for a maximum of 208 miles.
     The apparent superiority of the
American plane is still greater in
view of the accepted understanding
that its Seattle-Dayton flight was
made with only three-quarters of
its full power and that its maximum
with four 800 horse-power motors,
intended eventually to be re-

Republicans are evidently going to
harp on it from now on.
      While one finds it difficult to follow
the reasoning of the New Haven
ex-mayor that it is more a part 
of a national conspiracy for Gov
Cross to fail to mention the Roosevelt
administration than it would
have been for him to praise it, the
poetic English in which the governor
did his praising two years ago
does seem to lend some significance
to his failure to mention it now. In
1933, the governor, formerly dean
of the Yale graduate school and
veteran professor of English literature,
found his soul stirred, when
speaking for New Haven's present
mayor, to this glowing passage:-
      Over the horizon and the hills
the sun has appeared, the eternal
symbol of hope and life. We are
quickened by a stirring of new
faith and courage in a new deal.
The dawn of better and happier
days under the smiling, hopeful
leadership of President Roosevelt
tints the east with gold.
     The fact that the shrewd old gentlemen
who occupies the governor's
chair down in Hartford isn't saying
anything just now about "the
horizon" and "the hills" and the 
"new deal" may perhaps be explained
on other grounds than those
supplied by New Haven's Republican
ex-mayor. It may be, as some
shrewdly suggest, that the Democratic
mayor of New Haven, having
made a good record, deserves reelection
on that as the chief issue. It
may also be that the Democrats,
who generally suffered in the Connecticut
city and town elections not
long ago, have found that the new
deal isn't altogether their best talking
point, in Connecticut. And it
may be that "Uncle Toby," as his
intimate admirers still call Gov
Cross, having been quoted during
the summer as making occasional
remarks which indicated about the
same affection for the new deal and
its economics as have been shown by
ex-Gov Ely, doesn't see the new deal
quite as he did in 1933 and just
doesn't want to talk about it anyway.
Perhaps his silence can be
explained in all three ways.
     An American mining engineer
who lately visited Eritrea says that
he found there "a boom such as
America experienced years ago on
mining frontiers in the West." Why
not, with a big army using it as a 
base? But a mining boom is based 
on gold dug from the ground, not
on wealth dug from the pockets of
harassed taxpayers back home.
     Shortwave amateurs had a wonderful
time telling each other about
the earthquake. Ordinarily their
chats are limited to comparing notes
on the weather in different parts of
the country, and an exciting event
at midnight of which the sleeping
world has not yet been told keeps
the air full of chatter for hours.
     It is suggested in a dispatch from
Washington that "suasion of business
men" may in time lead the
government to lay an embargo on
trade with Italy. If there is to be
an embargo, that is not a very inspiring
kind of suasion in its behalf.
     Italy sympathizes with the British
who are forced to hold an election
at so untimely a moment, and
Great Britain sympathizes with the
Italians who never have a genuine
election. Is any country in a position
to be sorry for both of them?
     Montana may or may not be
cheered by being told that its
earthquakes are but the growing
pains of its mountains. For all
practical purposes its mountains are
already high enough.

FROM A FORMER RESIDENT
To the Editor of The Republican:-
     Very few cities have the natural
advantages which the City of Homes
has-geographically situated to be a 
key city for that section as a manufacturing
and distributing point,
beautifully located on the Connecticut
river, and within easy access to
the salt water and various large eastern
cities.
     Add to these the superb school system,
the diversity of its industries
and other features which should make
your city stand out among the important
centers of the nation.
     It would seem with a united effort
on the part of the various civic organizations,
the city, its people, industries
and numerous other advantages,
could be told to millions,
through the medium of its newspapers,
radio, etc.

IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION
To the Editor of The Republican:-
     If the subject were not so tragic,
one might be amused at the futile
and almost frantic efforts and appeals
which are constantly being made in
the attempt to reduce the number of 
automobile fatalities.
     We continue to produce faster and 
more powerful cars, knowing full well
that the greater the power and speed,
the more difficult are they to control
in an emergency. We deplore that
there are so many drivers whose mental
or moral balance is not up to the
standard required for the safe operation
of these machines, yet we provide
operator's licenses for nearly all who
apply.
     And, as if this laxity did not allow
enough reckless morons on the highways,
we make it as easy as possible
to procure the drug which can so impair
the judgment and skill of any
driver as to transform him or her
into a menace and a potential killer.
We even resort to extensive advertising
to promote its more general use.
     In short, we demand more safety,
more speed and more alcohol. This
combination is impossible and everyone
knows it. Yet we still go blindly
on trying to beat the immutable law
which decrees that as we sow we also
reap. Truly Shakespeare is right when
he makes one of his characters exclaim,
"Lord, what fools these mortals
be!"   FRED W. PACKER.
Norwich, N.Y., October 31, 1935.
PATRIOTISM
To the Editor of The Republican:-
     Flag waving and lip service to the
constitution are no proofs of real
patriotism. The American Legion and
the Veterans of Foreign Wars are
very fierce against a little boy who
has religious scruples about saluting 
the flag, yet they are unpatriotically
demanding their bonus many years
before it is legally due, and at a time
when it is highly inconvenient to be
country to pay it.     C.M.G.
Boston, October 31, 1935.

The Golden Books
The Master's Touch
Horatius Bonar
In the still air the music lies unheard;
In the rough marble beauty hides unseen:
To wake the music and the beauty
needs
The master's touch, the sculptor's
chisel keen.
Great Master, touch us with thy skillful
hand;
Let not the music that is in us die!
Great Sculptor, hew and polish us; nor
let,
Hidden and lost, thy form within us
lie!
Spare not the stroke! Do with us as 
Thou wilt!
Let there be naught unfinished, broken,
marred;
Complete the purpose, that we may
become
The perfect image, O our God and 
Lord!
