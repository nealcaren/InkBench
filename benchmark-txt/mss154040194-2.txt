Dear Mrs Chapmann Catt, 
We took in our programme of this year
to read lectures [?} "Famous Women." Mrs [Re???] [Ja??culescu] and 
I will do it, she in the L. D. D. F. and I in popular evening courses.
But as there are no complete libraries in Romania and not
a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know
the titles of the books, necessary for preparation. We adress therefore
to you as to the other sections of T. W. S. A. to ask your help.
Feeling so much the lips of a few library we will
try at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and
perhaps than will we be able to assemblee round it the
women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time.
Would your association be able for the generous act of [---]
help [?] sisters and to send us one or the other standard work
on women movement in your country and specially
books, where we could find biographies of your famous women?
We would speak in a first serie of lectures "on politicel and sociel
[?] women" and in a second Draw the portraits of "women 
in art and science." But we know so little, it is to say not much
