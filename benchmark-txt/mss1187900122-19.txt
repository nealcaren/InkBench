London Sunday May 6, 94.
Dear Mr. Douglass:
Your letter directed to Manchester
has followed me all round
till it reached me here. I am indeed
glad to get it. When I wrote to you
I had not seen your letter to Mr.
Aked; since seeing it I know
from what he and others said
that while they did not expect
"gush" (may they pay you the same
compliment I do, in knowing you
to be incapable of such a thing)
still they would have been
better satisfied if you had 
spoken more positively regarding
me and my work. Mr Aked thought 
that since the Society had failed
so miserably and I was thus left
to vouch for myself, you would
not hesitate to vouch for me.
We cannot go thro the country
telling people about this personal
quarrel and why I am unaccompanied
by the persons
who brought me over. As the
best known member of the
race, a positive letter or voucher
