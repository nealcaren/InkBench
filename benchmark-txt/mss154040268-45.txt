To the Speakers Bureau:

Those roses were sweet, beautiful, temper dispelling, but
Roses sind Verboten.

Keep your money to defend the suit to vindicate my
character. Please don't disobey orders again.
I have a vile temper, growing viler every day which
shows what politics will do for a woman. It
is a daily comfort to witness the placidity of
the Speakers Bureau!
