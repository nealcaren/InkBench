with enthusiasm.  They have been much
appreciated - more than you can know.
I am longing to hear who is going to 
Rome, how and when.  I am as ignorant
as a wild turkey and I am beginning
to worry lest the mail I need reaches
Panama after I have gone.  You have
been the best correspondent for your
letters are always here when I arrive.
I learn that mail is not carried by
this boat to N.Y but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you will
get this soon.  It is not far to Panama.
Please accept my collective letter 
as one for you.  I must go to dress now.
I sent it to Mother She will deliver it to
the office.
Lovingly indeed!
