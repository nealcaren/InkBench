My Dear Mrs Dickinson
I am afraid your business 
affairs are again suffering.  You have
not the party calculated to carry
much weight.  “Nice a man as ever lived"
but “can’t keep a Hotel”. I am sorry.  I
think had I engineered your “bus”
with John McCullogh it might have
been now in a diferent position
You told me you would see me about
your theatrical business and the next I hear
you have “a Boy” (as it were) dabling
with your affairs and “mixing those children
up”. I thought you had a dear experience
before with “Amateur Managers” and had
learned by experiences the value of management
Dont think I am scolding you only that I
feel slighted.  I could do more for you than any
man in this business or out of it for that
matter & would (or will) have done it cheerfully
