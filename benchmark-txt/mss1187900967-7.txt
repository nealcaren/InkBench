were on your knees.  Nevertheless
Should you come, a fathers house
a father's house, a father's welcome
will be given now.  You would
find me in very pleasant surroundings,
not quite such as I have on Cedar
hill-you very well adapted to
this climate and country. I
note what you say of young
cook.  I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
Few are more sorry still to
know that he served Annie
such a mean trick- She
did a good deal for him. That
is perhaps, the trouble.  Had she
done less She would have
received more thanks. Gratitude
is not a very strong
feature of the colored race.
