Concord June 14 1885

My dear Friend:
I have sent
you various portions of 
my book in a fragmentary
form, not having duplicate 
proofs enough to
give you what I would
like, just yet.  I shall
soon have advance sheets 
of the whole 650 pages
and will send you an
early copy should you
desire it.  As I get
back proofs from others
to whom I have sent
them, I may send you
more.  Today I enclose 
the end of
Chapter XIV, including 
Bracketts account of
his visit to Brown in
[*157*]
