happens to be absent, just now, in discharge
of his official duties, at “Sooyass Lake,” in the
“Okanagan Country,” as they call it here. For
a year and a half, until two week ago, it was
almost a perfect blank in my life’s journey.

being. Since the surgical operation, two months
ago, which extracted the cataract from my
left eye, and then waiting for the soreness and
