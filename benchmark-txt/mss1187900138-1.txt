Hon Fred Douglass

Dear Sir
Francis M Adlington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age sends the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration

"Father Abraham's Monument"

This monument would seem to say 
That Lincoln's dead, but tis not so.
In vain the assassins aim to slay
In vain his blood was made to flow.

In vain the vile attempt to kill.
In all our hearts he's living still.
And while a drop of patriots blood
Shall flow in any human frame

Twill thrill at memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln's name
This monument we raise to thee
Great chief whose mandates made us free

Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
For thee, our true and constant friend.

Also the following  

"Address to America Personified"
The world is gazing on thee.
Dispose thy robes with care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy Golden hair.

"over"
