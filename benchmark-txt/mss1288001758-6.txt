that may do for summer.
Just this moment comes the
little boy with your letter
thank you Harry dear.  I
sympathize with the pang
you [will] feel at Mr.
Bronsons decline.  But all
things work together for good
to so good souls as yours.  So
Harry dear never mind.
There must be something good
for you somewhere because
you deserve it.  I am glad
the children are as good as
nice pie.  I hope they will
keep so.  Tell Mary I want
to have brine on the butter.
Please look and see if there
is any - Love to Mother &
all - but most to you.
aff - Lucy
