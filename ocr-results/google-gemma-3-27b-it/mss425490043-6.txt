The luncheon takes place at 1 oâ€™clock & 
and the length of time devoted to ad-
dress is about one-half give minutes 
at most. 

Please let me have a short sketch 
which we may use for publication in
our newspapers relative to yourself
and your public work. We would like 
to have this by Thursday A.M. of the coming
week so it can be included in League
notes for next week.

Mr. Davis and I shall be very much 
pleased to have you as our guest 
while in our city.
