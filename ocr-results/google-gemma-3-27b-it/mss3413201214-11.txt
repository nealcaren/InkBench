[*handwritten note*]
There is to be a suffrage festival here
to have Journals both – Can you send 
us any decorations and a large Card
to hang some “Newside” Page – and it 
have about 50 subscription Blankes – 
We never done anything of this sort and

But Dr. Huntington who is getting up the 
festival telephoned this morning that 
Alice Paul had sent her word she would 
drop by the cash creating, a booth for the 
suffragists, and Mr. John Swietzer had after 
the coach erecting it he will be here by
