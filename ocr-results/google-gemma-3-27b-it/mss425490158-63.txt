## Fellowship Church Music

A national honour associate of Fellowship Church remarked recently that it was work at a tiny across the country to join in the hymns of this particular congregation during the spring of 1946 as an event with an occasional soloist, the present choral unit has grown to a choir of thirty voices. It is a point of pride for this church - intrepid choral unit of serious music students, many of whom are now training for concert careers. The choir is fortunate to have the leadership of Miss Cornelius Burke Williams, an outstanding young teacher of San Francisco. B. S. Williams chose for pioneer choral work at a time when there was high opposition to the practice in anyone. In order to demonstrate her belief in the principles to which the Church itself gives testimony. 

The Church has won distinctions, singing hymns in recent months, conducting the Fellowship Church twilight series based on worship through the arts. They have given a number of recitals and concerts with Dr. Thurman as reader. Her recent performance of the Bach-Salani Master Suit Rossini Readings were made, which provides this service are now available to members and friends from the country. She has served as solo accompanist to the nightly sessions at Friendship House in New York City. 

The committee in its meeting at the Fellowship Church in San Francisco found that the questions regarding the children’s rooms and the children’s hour were finally settled. It was unanimously agreed that the rooms should be made to serve as a type of juvenile reading room, and that a super vised program be worked out to delight builders and children this season. Arrangements now are being made for a child’s librarian to take charge of the room during the hours the public is invited in the appointment of Mrs. Thurmann as supervisor of the children’s hour, a consistent important service of the church will continue under the same leadership.
