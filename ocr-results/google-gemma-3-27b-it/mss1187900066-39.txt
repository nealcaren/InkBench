Concord June 14 1885—
My dear Friend—
I have sent you poems perhaps by
by post, or a fragment.
Select such as will flat
give you what I earned
take not yet done all
been inaction as shook
of the whole 650 pages
and will sent you an
extra copy— Have you seen
 Celints. If so, go back, bring from other 
where I have sent them.  I have sent you
more.  Doubtful in-
close the first of my
chapter XIV, in Lucy
Ozawaett, as countess.
in visit of Boccon.
