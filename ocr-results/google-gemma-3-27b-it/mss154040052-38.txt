My Dear Miss Blackwell:

I am sorry to trouble you again about that annuity.
The annuity has gone through and yet there remains something 
to do. 

I enclose a paper which they ask both you and me to
sign. You must have a witness, but not a notary, so any one
will do.

I could tell the Insurance Company to send the checks
to me and would do so, but all insurance companies have
a rule that any check must be endorsed by the actual person
receiving the money; therefore, when the check is sent the bene-
ficiary of an annuity, both are required to endorse it. If either-
wise agreed. Every check, therefore, would have to be sent
over to Boston for my endorsement and sent back to me for
deposit, hence the necessity for getting authority to have all 
the checks sent to me. 

The annuity has gone through and I have the policy.
I deposited with the Northeastern Mutual Life Insurance Company
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, $3,600 and received annuity $468.

The total income from the $6,000 in $246.08 per year. 
It is my intention to divide each quarter into three. You will,
therefore, receive $73.36 each quarter for your life. The thought
is to pay this annuity as the seventh month is come. The first
payment will be made on September 15, 1935 and will forever
and that shall keep to the course. The third will come on June 15, 1936
and the fourth on the one. You will know in September, the year, 
it will certainly come. In other words, each March, June, Septem-
ber and December. The one.

Please enclose your signature and your witnesses, and I will
forward it to the Insurance Company as soon as you may.

Yours truly,

Robt. Addams Cadwell.
P.S.   I trust you are still having a very pleasant summer. 
I live here at the home and am one to do the lifting here. 
I am working on an income tax.
