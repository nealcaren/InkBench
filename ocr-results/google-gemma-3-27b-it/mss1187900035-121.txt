I have had a most
exhausting and fatiguing 
day.  Since the Dr. Radeliff
left side of the Turks Hotel,
I have visited Mr. Hall, Mr. 
& Mrs. Postell & Mr. Smith
- all interested to 
watch over for the Patel.
It actually seemed wicked
to break upon mistaken
ideas and again engage
upon the tedious delay 
I received a telegraph from 
& to accept the situation.
I was glad to be able
to unite to matter of fact,
and I had recognized
and rightly appreciated the
depth of face.  I have
have before dealt to them.
