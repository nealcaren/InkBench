as lectures in Washington—
when I knew I could count on you.
This is my letter of inquiry—
Have you given up your
journey to Egypt? If so I
cannot help being glad as there
was a good memory reason why
I had rather think of you
both as remains to let—If I could
have written as formally, I should
not have so long postponed my
inquiries—But I am obliged
to curtail my letter both as to
number & length—
I hope that it will turn
out that you are to pass the
winter in your pleasant & accustomed
comfortable home—Mr. & Mrs.
[Illegible] have the horrors of the
Spring has come many inconveniences
& my poor Aunt Lucretia is no 
more quiet could enlighten or
lengthen her years if your three 
we always yours—Both of you—
of your lectures and to desire that
I was there to enjoy it—I'm
sure that you can make your
experience very interesting and
valuable—And then Mrs.
Douglass has a doubt but her
hands full of interesting work
about which you can assist 
him if you have not all that
you can do yourself—
I shall write to Miss Stanton
13-day and tell her all that
I know of your movements—
because of so much I am cautious
that you cannot lecture in
Washington as the slaves on the read
to Ports-am-Princeton—
I count Mr Douglass to exercise
great mental strain and to be—
but his waning years will see us
