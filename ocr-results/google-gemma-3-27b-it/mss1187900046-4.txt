My Dear Father.
I have received your
kind letter and was
very glad to hear from you, but I am so 
sorry that you feel
so. A hard going to 
Rochester, I hope it will
be all right there, 
when you go thair. I
shall take good care of your
letters and not think of 
disappointing in any way,
we have had a few very 
cold days here we have
more pleasant weather.
