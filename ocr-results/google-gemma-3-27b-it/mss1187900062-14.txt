ALBERT R. WALKER,
COUNSELOR AT LAW,
(Including Patent Causes.)

Hartford, Connecticut.

Oct. 6, 18th colored people take
to complaining of oppression &c.,
they would advance a suspicion that
of you. But, friend, in the North
the application of laws & the
exclusion of discriminating 
Black laws & the extension of 
the ballot to the colored man:
these are secure & of the colored
men & diminishing by laws the
uncontrolled and general exclusion
of colored people â€“ even 
particular privileges, resolves &c.,
will look rather childish. If 
you did & show that the colored
people care more for the show 
than for the substance of citizenship.
