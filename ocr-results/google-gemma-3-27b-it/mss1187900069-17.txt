man has equaled in the past and one
can hope to exceed in the future. 
Nor does the obligation end with the race
The whole nation has reason to be grateful
for the large and lofty example of 
patriotism given in the man and so 
beautifully, and fittingly expressed in the oration
I can only add my individual thanks
from the depths of my heart for the 
strong and true words of wisdom, given
by way of advice to my own people and 
for the benefits which will result to each 
and all of us because of the Union which 
effect which your oration will have upon
the better portion of the white people of the
country, making and hoping that you may 
be spared many, many years to instruct
and influence for good this great American
Nation - I am, my dear friend, most 
Gratefully, Yours, William H. H. Hart.
