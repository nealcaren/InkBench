For God & Country
Dear Sir

Francis M. Wellington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age renders the following
offering for the National Monument commemorating
“Father Abraham’s Monument”

This Monument would seem to say
what Lincoln deed, but tend to do.
to raise the American arm to play – 
to raise the blood tides Made to flow.
to raise the tide attempt to lift
to act on hearts his living hate.
And while a chop of patriotic blood
Shall flow in any human frame.
Twice thrice at memory of the good 
the great and noble Lincon’s Name.
This Monument we raise to thee
Great Chief whose Mandate Made us free
Our grateful Hands to Heaven ascend
for thee, our hue and constant friend.
2709

“Script to America Perennified”
The Vortex is gaping on thee. 
Dispose thy votes with care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy Golden hair.
