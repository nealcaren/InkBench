Cedar Hill, Anacostia D.C.
July 13. 1889.

My dear Bennett,

Soon after your previous excellent
letter, and before I could see him about the
Cruickshanks & St. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, without
vote or warning departed from Washington
for Bar Harbor, where he now is and is reported
to remain till October; at least so
say the papers. He evidently found the climate
of Washington at this season, unfriendly with
his peculiar & his opinion seems to manifest him.

In any lost interview with him, I was encouraged
than time toil, and anxiety, had made
inroads upon his health and constitution.
And that he must either take rest, or resort
would take him. For him, and other men 
knowing that a personal interview with him
would be far better for his own writing thing
I have not ventured the Lt. Thomas proposal
to him as yet.  The President, too, as &
bore him since Mr. Blaine left.

It is understood here that no consular
appointments will now be made in the
absence of Secretary Blaine, however rigorous
