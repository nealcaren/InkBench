**FREEDMEN'S BUREAU**

11

“VI. Brigadier General R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plan-
tations, and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or
desired in the settlement now on Beaufort island, nor will any rights to property heretofore
acquired be affected thereby.”

“By order of Major General W. T. Sherman” 	“L. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant General.”

In Virginia quite an amount of land was libelled and about to be sold by the
marshal to the Secretary of War in order that the freedmen might be turned
over to the bureau for the benefit of the freedmen. I claimed that these lands,
which had been condemned to sale, though not actually sold, were already the
property of the government, and objected to his excellency the President
against the insertion of the word “sold” in the definition of confiscated prop-
erty. The President referred the matter to the Attorney General, whereupon,
this decision necessitated the restoration of all the property where the sale
had been suspended. I have been very desirous of conforming to the letter of
the law in settling apart lands, but was unwilling to do so before it became prob-
able that they could be retained. In this way much disappointment and suffer-
ing would be avoided. 

The freedmen were so eager for the possession of land, and so likely, without
that possession in fact or in prospect, to be obliged to leave their present homes,
that I made the following proposition through yourself:

BUREAU OF REFUGEES, FREEDMEN, AND ABANDONED LANDS,
Washington, September 4, 1865.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

SIR: The matter of imposing some conditions in the cases of pardoning those who have
been presented to me by the Attorney General, and a plan having been suggested by a dis-
tinguished officer of the army which I heartily endorse, I deem it best to combine those who
have been accepted in this proposal, to wit:

1st. That hereafter pardons of the President of the United States extended to those who
were owners of property, in the condition of May 29, 1865, having more than 20,000 dollars’
worth of property, be conditioned by specific stipulation in each individual case: that the
owners shall convey to the freedmen now in possession of such lands one-fourth of so much
land—or, as is often the case, the whole—as shall be deemed sufficient for their support 
and independence;

2d. That the freedmen shall have a fair and equitable lien upon the land thus conveyed to 
them for the value of improvements of every kind—hereditaments and personal—they may 
have made; 

3d. That the title thus conveyed shall be in trust for the freedmen, to be held and enjoyed 
by them and their heirs forever, unless they shall fail to comply with the conditions named. 

4th. That the owners so pardoned shall execute a bond to the United States, in a sufficient 
penalty, conditioned upon the faithful performance of said stipulations; and

5th. These conditions to apply to all cases, except those already disposed of, or those where 
the owner can show satisfactory evidence to the effect that the freedmen are already fairly 
compensated for their labor.

I fully believe that many owners, even those most opposed to this measure, would gladly 
comply with these conditions, rather than subject themselves to the long and expensive pro-
cess of proving their loyalty to the government. I have the honor to be, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

O. O. HOWARD, 

Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers, 

Commissioner. 

Hon. E. M. STANTON, 

Secretary of War.
