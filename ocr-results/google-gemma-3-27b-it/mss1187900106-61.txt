JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Liberia, a republic on the western coast of Africa,
founded in 1822 by the American Colonization Society,
and declared independent in 1847.  It extends from 4°
30' to 8° N. lat. and from 7° to 10° 30' W. lon., and
comprehends a coast line of about 350 m., the greater
part of which is low and sandy. The coast stretches
from Cape Palmas to Cape Mount, in the Atlantic Ocean.
Area, 699 miles, extending inland from the coast from 10 to 40
m. Drainage is imperfect. The country consists of lowlands
from the native tribes, was estimated in 1890 at 1,400,000 square
miles. The population consists of descendants of freed
slaves, and natives generally docile and friendly.
In the interior the country rises, swelling into forest-covered
hills and mountains. 

Many streams flow to the ocean, but some of them is 
obstructed by bars and sandbanks at their mouths, and 
most important are the St. Paul, navigable for libere
crafts. The climate is hot and humid throughout the year; 
the rains begin in May and last through November. 
The thermometer rarely falls below 70°, while in the dry
season, from December to April ,the average heat is 84° F.;
ill the coast, fevers are not unusual, and malarial fevers prevail
the climate is considered the most healthful on the coast.
Temperature is high: temperature 70° - 90°, the thermometer
often rising to 100°. The heaviest rainfall occurs in August.
In the interior Africa the climate is peculiar, being very dry in 
October - March but very warm; and from April - September,
the rainy season is remarkable for the great amount of 
clouds. There is a great deal of mist, and as much as 200
inches of rain falls in a year.
 
Vegetation is extraordinarily luxuriant in the lowlands,
and the soil is very fertile: much of the land is covered with
dense forests composed of a great variety of trees, among
which are the ebony, mahogany, ironwood, cottonwood, silk
cotton, and palm trees. Ironwood, ginger, cola, indiarubber,
camwood, &c. There is a great quantity of useful plants.
Palm kernels are the chief produce. Pineapples, plantains,
bananas, oranges, lemons, mangoes, breadfruit, herbs, 
indigo, and numerous spices are also grown. Sweet potatoes,
casava, yams, maize, beans, rice, sugarcane, ground-nuts, 
and coffee are cultivated. 

The chief exports are palm kernels, caoutchouc, coffee,
sugar, cotton, timber, ivory, gold dust, and dyewoods. 
Among the valuable forest products are mahogany, ebony,
camwood, and redwood. The lands produce an abundance of
food for the population. The country abounds in wild
animals, as the elephant, tiger, leopard, hyena, lion, 
crocodile, hippopotamus, monkey, and a great variety of
birds. Liberia has trade relations with Great Britain, 
France, Germany, and the United States. It has a national
debt of over $1,000,000.
 
Capital, Monrovia, situated on Cape Mesurado, was first
settled in 1822 by the American Colonization Society, and
named in honor of James Monroe, the then president of the
United States. Pop. in 1886 (estimated), 3,500. Other
towns are Harper, near Cape Palmas, and Buchanan. 
Liberia seems not to be able to attain the capacity of a
self-governing government. It does produce a great variety 
of fruits, rarities and food, with an export surplus which
offers the nation a natural route to international trade. 
The soil produces rice, sugarcane, coffee, cacao, indigo,
ground-nuts, and cotton. The island is home to monkeys,
crocodiles, lions and other wildlife; and is an ideal nation
for the self-determination of former enslaved Africans. 

The native is quiet, subdued, and docile. The country
is not likely to become a great power, but it may become 
a thriving colony. Here the native American black man may 
live in peace and security, and the results of his labor are
his own.
