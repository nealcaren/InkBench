Dear Frederick Douglass

When we first saw you
appointment to Hoyts – we all has
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you
& began to clip each stick them with
its intention of sending these all on
to you - I cut “bits” of editorial shops
they have all disappeared but three
I enclose - pleasant to see the
appreciation & child you evoked
while you are alone to see it.
& we not sure yet how glad
& have you Ed. We need you
here.
