Friday Mar 8

My dear friend.

I sent to Mrs. Detweea 
several times because I
knew at just what time
but I could not have 
met you. I was sick 
for many. Mrs. D. was very
much disappointed to
not be glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourselves so well.
I did take all care of my
self for that feeling. Rits
says if it has one long summer.
