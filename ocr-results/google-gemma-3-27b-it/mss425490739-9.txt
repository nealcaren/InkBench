**NOTED MEN HONOR JACKSON**
**President Roosevelt and Other Dignitaries Attend Exercises at the Old Homestead—Great Crowds Witness the Ceremonies—Speeches by Prominent Orators.**

**From Our Own Correspondent.**
Hillsboro, N.C., February 23.—The old Jackson homestead was the scene today of a most impressive demonstration in honor of the memory of Andrew Jackson.  The attendance was enormous, fully 10,000 people being present. They came from all sections of North Carolina, and from other Southern States.  The exercises consisted of speeches by Governor Terry of North Carolina, Senator Robert R. Tillman of South Carolina, and Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia. 

**President’s Arrival**
The President arrived at 11:30 o’clock this morning, and was joined here by Governor Terry and his party.  The President was met at the station by a committee of reception and escorted to the old homestead.  He then entered a carriage and was driven to the mansion. The old homestead is now the property of W.L. Craven, a local merchant of this section, who lives here with his sister, Mrs. Martha Craven, the last direct descendant of Andrew Jackson. 

**The Afternoon Programme**
The afternoon programme consisted of speeches. Governor Terry opened the demonstration with an address giving a sketch of Jackson’s long and eventful life. He spoke of Jackson as a man of the people, a soldier, a statesman and a patriot.  Senator Tillman followed with a stirring speech, in which he declared Jackson one of the greatest men this country has ever produced, and told of his courage.  Dr. Alderman concluded the programme with an earnest discussion of the characteristics of Jackson’s leadership.

**The Crowd**
There were present today many of North Carolina’s most distinguished citizens—Senator George H. White, Congressman J.A. Patterson, Judge Walter A. Montgomery, of the Supreme Court; ex-Governor Daniel G. Fowle; Rev. Charles Edward McNeill, of Charlotte, and numerous other men of prominence.  The orators included the Hon. William L. Hackney, Judge James P. Erwin, of Durham; the Hon. J.P. Wyche, Jr., of Charlotte, and the Hon. R.S. McNeill, of Greensboro.

**A Mammoth Meeting**
The celebration was an unqualified success. Arrangements were complete in every detail, and the crowd behaved itself admirably. The town of Hillsboro was decorated with flags and bunting, and the streets were crowded with people.  

**A Notable Gathering**
A temporary platform had been erected in front of the old mansion.  Here the speakers addressed the multitudes.  A large number of Confederate veterans were present, as were members of the North Carolina National Guard.   The programme was interrupted by a sudden shower, but the rain did not dampen the enthusiasm of the crowd.  

**Jackson’s Birthplace**
The birthplace of Jackson lies about seven miles from the homestead. It is a small log cabin, and is well preserved.  Many of the visitors made a pilgrimage to the cabin to view the historic spot.  The celebration was under the auspices of the Andrew Jackson Memorial Association, of which Dr. E.S. Thompson, of Lexington, is the president.
