Miss Mary Gray Peck,
R.D. No.2
Geneva, N.Y.

My dear Miss Peck:

In the “WOMAN’S JOURNAL” of next week there 
will be a statement concerning boarding houses, 
hotels and steamers, and this is the best I can 
do in the way of information. 

I am expecting to sail on March 1st. I have
made my application for space on the North German
Lloyd, but if I fail there I shall try for a steam–
er sailing the same date on the Hamburg-American
line. Miss Hall is going with me. Do you want to
go as early as that? If so no surprise you would
enjoy staying in Germany. I do think, but I’m not
sure about residing in Stockholm long, you wanted to
be there a while anyway.

We are all in readiness for the International 
Congress in Budapest. If you can come be sure to
let me know at once. I shall leave a space for you 
on my list of usual guests. I am sure you will 
enjoy the Congress immensely.

Yours sincerely, 
Carrie Chapman Catt.

determination. 
The more hardships we meet and
