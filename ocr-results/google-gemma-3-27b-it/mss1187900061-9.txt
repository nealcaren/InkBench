instead of making muffins
and biscuits I would try 
send you a line. I hope
you will excuse bad writing
and spelling as you well
find. I have seen Miss
Breyer twice since you
left. Every thing is going
on just the same so I have
no news to tell
you all are well at
home hoping that
you are. Rosa is well
and sends love to you.

Truly your
friend
