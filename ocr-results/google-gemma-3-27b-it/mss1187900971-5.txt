Grandpa was never called “Lloyd”.
He was first Frederick Bailey, the slave
Changed to Johnson when he ran
away, and because the man in 
whose home he lived in New Bedford 
was named Douglass Johnson; Thomas
who had just finished reading
“The Lady of the Lake” admired
would like to call himself “Douglass” asked
Frederick to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, he then 
would like to call himself 
Douglass instead of Johnson. 
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another and hence 
forth set out to be called 
Frederick Douglass. 
These facts – not hearsay. 

Later – just rec’d. letter from “today –
leaves on his debating tour to day –
and nearly debates at Howard. He
will stop with oral. Live already metters
his wife & Mamie and sent regards.”
