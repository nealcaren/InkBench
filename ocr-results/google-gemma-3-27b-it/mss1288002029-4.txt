“The Governor consents,” replied Mr. Hayes, illustration surprise in view of the intriguing and intimate tone which Mrs. Van Tassel's
letters had revealed. “But I repeat, it must be understood that this concession is made solely to
secure the vote of the Senator.”

“I do not doubt that,” returned his companion, smiling. “But isn’t it a little dangerous to
believe that a man’s principles can be governed by personal inclination?”

“However this may be,” replied Mrs.
Van Tassel, with an air of delightful nonchalance,
“I cannot conceive of a sentiment truly noble
or truly great in its source that fails to
make the world better. Men are so apt to
judge one another instead of trying to understand one another. Affection, for instance, has
been considered by some a weakness, and yet
it is the most powerful engine of human progress! I do not believe that an obligation to seek
the happiness of another is in any way opposed
to duty.”

“Very true,” responded the Governor’s prelate,
controlling a veiled smile. “But I fancy there
is a very different matter to speak of. If I
do not mistake, we are trifling with an issue
far weightier than any I have yet encountered,
for it involves a deliberate attempt to betray
a solemn trust.” 

“Why, what do you mean, and do you think,
sir, that I would venture to any such trickery?”

“Some time ago,” continued the clergyman,
“I received a letter from my brother, who
holds a responsible post in Washington. This
letter contained, between the lines, a rather
significant suspicion, to the effect that an
effort was being made to coerce certain legislators. Should it in good faith be concluded
that the vote of a Senator is to be purchased,
what would you say to that?”

Mrs. Van Tassel stirred her chocolate, and
replied in a tone of studied indifference:

“I shouldn’t like it at all! It seems to me
that if any one were guilty of such a proceeding
he would deserve the severest possible penalty.”

“That is fortunate, madam," observed the
clergyman thoughtfully, “for I am fearful that
we have unwittingly found ourselves upon the
very brink of such an offense.”

“You are too severe!” exclaimed Mrs. Van
Tassel, her voice betraying a hint of agitation.
“You are judging me harshly and without
cause.”

“I assure you, madam," said the clergyman,
“I speak only from a sense of duty. If what
I suspect is true—and I fear it is—you are
entangling yourself in a web of deceit from
which it may be difficult, if not impossible,
to escape.”
