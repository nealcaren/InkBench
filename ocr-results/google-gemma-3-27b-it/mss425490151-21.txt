Dear Voters in the Convention by Mail of the National Woman’s Party:

The report of the Elections Committee, signed by Dr. Margaret Sebree, Chairman, has been handed to me. A copy is enclosed herewith. 

Delegates from over the country sent in their ballots. Each delegate represented twenty-five members. All nominees proposed by the Nominating Committee were elected. A number of other names were written in; in many cases these were of members who had, for one reason or another, expressed their inability to serve, and whose names had therefore not been proposed by the Nominating Committee.

It will be recalled that in addition to the newly elected Council members, all former National Chairman and all State Chairmen are members of the National Council ex officio.

May I, as first Convention Chairman, thank all of you for your splendid cooperation during this, our first Convention by mail. The registration fee which many of you sent has been most helpful.

We are indebted to the members of the Nominating Committee, the Credentials Committee, and the Resolutions Committee, and the Elections Committee, for their many, many hours of laborious work during the hot weather. It is largely due to the painstaking effort of these committees that the undertaking of a Convention by Mail has been brought to a successful conclusion. 

There are no words adequate to express our regret over losing Alice Paul as our National Chairman. Her great leadership has made it possible for the Amendment to reach its present position of strength in Congress. Miss Paul will still be helping us, since she is now planning to devote her time to the World Woman’s Party, of which she is Chairman. Since the National Woman’s Party is the United States branch of the World Woman’s Party, Miss Paul will be working closely with us. 

I want, on behalf of all of us, to give a very warm welcome to our new Chairman, Anita Politzer, and to all of our new officers and Council members. Miss Politzer’s devoted service and years of accomplishment for all of us are well known to you, as are her exceptional qualifications for the heavy duties she is about to undertake. Let us all gather so that we may get strongly behind her and the other officers and Council members so that we can achieve success for Equal Rights at an early date.

The Resolutions as adopted by the Convention will be printed in the next issue of the Equal Rights.

Sincerely,

Edna Kenton
