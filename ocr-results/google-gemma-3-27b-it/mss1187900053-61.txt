Dear Mr. Douglas,

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you, we heard from you, and
I think we now in hopes of pro-
curing a reply. We really are
very unwell in the dark about
you, & do not know whether
you still hold office under the
Government, as we have not been
by the Contrary conclude that you 
do, & therefore that you counteract
is good - that you cite repre-
well yourself, & your family.
