On Thursday morning we sailed forth at an early hour after 
photographs, and I bought two dozen. We then went to Lady
MacKensie’s for morning tea. We found her with her hat on, as
that fool luncheon has reached S.A. Later we visited the Museum.
Miss Cameron lunched with Lady Steel, who has married and come to 
S.A., but I dared not do so much and rested at the hotel. At 
four there was a tea out of town about a mile. The Lady, Mrs. 
Davis, the wife of a publisher, sent her carriage for me and sent 
me home. She had a beautiful big home and the drawing room was 
of elegant size with a platform at one end. I never saw a room 
anywhere which I envied more. In the evening we had our public 
meeting. 

We left Hartleburg the next morning, arriving in 
Durban about one o’clock. The usual committee met us. Never did 
they fail to do this and to see us off. We went at once to our 
hotel where for 15 shillings inclusive we had most delightful 
rooms facing the sea. This was Friday, October 13th. After 
lunch a little cleaning up, we went to a meeting of the Club 
(suffrage). She was a dreamer, Mrs.Ayrton telling 
to do the work, but the material must be purchased at the shop, 
however, funds came to save that expense of muslin made for 
the occasion. At 3 we went to a Delegates’ meeting, and at 8 our 
public meeting. A horrible hall, draughty and hot, full of 
men, who talked all through it. I spoke for about half an hour. 
It was a pleasure to see Mrs.Penny, and to know she was with us.

succeeded and left the muslin for two more dresses. We met the 
ladies of the suffrage club for morning tea at Mrs.Restaurant and it
was a curious sight to see crowds of men and women gathered at 
this hour for their precious cup. Then went shopping, getting 
back to the hotel at 1 for lunch. I unpacked further in the 
afternoon and Mrs.Ayers and Mrs.Behr took tea with me at four and 
I was occupied with callers until dinner. It was good to get to 
bed early. On Sunday I worked more with my things and went with 
Miss Cameron to Mrs. Kerr-Cross’s for tea at four. She received 
us out of doors. We found Dr. Jacobs, Mrs.Boerma and some dele-
gates had arrived at the hotel. Again I went to bed early, but 
first I trimmed a new hat I had bought. 

On Monday the Convention began and I was present every 
minute to advise when necessary. We met from eleven to one and 
from 2:30 to 5. In the evening was the reception, where I spoke 
and again got into the those who bored me. On Tuesday we met in 
the morning and in the afternoon we went out in two midia 
launches to Talicharry Island where among the trees and mosquitoes 
we had tea which was served among the delicious home made cakes. 
We pleased afternoon. That evening the public
meeting in a small hall where the room was overfull and at the 
end of beetroot. I spoke and had luncheon near the hall. Miss 
Cameron assisted.
