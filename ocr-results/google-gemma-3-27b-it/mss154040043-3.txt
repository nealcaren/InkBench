Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
Woman’s Citizen Committee,
171 Madison Avenue, New York City.

Dear Mrs. Catt:

As a member of the D.A.R., I am protesting against the propaganda which the officers of the Society have adopted from Mrs. Robinson, F.M.Winfield, E.H.Hunter, etc. It occurs to me that it would be useful to be able to quote Mrs. Robinson’s anti-suffrage utterances, as showing that in that campaign she was opposed by the same fears and used the same arguments as are now against our more useful liberal organizations. Can you send me clippings of her anti-suffrage orations or pamphlets or letters? or can you direct me to where I might find these? I am very desirous of contradicting Mrs. Robinson, who is being taken very seriously by the D.A.R. officers and by many of the rank and file of members.

Can you give me any information about H.M.Alderman, president of The Better America Federation, and president of the Pittsburgh Pipe and Supply Co., recently indicted for usury? I have been told the above facts, but have no details.

To me it seems a strange phenomenon that the officers of the D.A.R. have committed themselves to this propaganda, and I cannot help wondering if their affiliations are with the great corporations which are fighting change in industrial conditions. I know how the Diamond Match Company fought against giving up the use of phosphorus which produced “phossy jaw” in their unfortunate employees. The mill owners are fighting the Child Labor Amendment, and the D.A.R. are opposed to the Child Labor Amendment, passing a resolution to that effect at their Congress in 1926, although the chapters throughout the country had had no opportunity to discuss this resolution beforehand – a resolution which I very much deplore. In the Report of the proceedings of the Congress of 1927, the Delegate from North Carolina gave $1000. to Mrs. William Sherman Walker for her use as Chairman of National Defense. This "National Defense" propaganda seems to me only a raw material, drawn across the scent of Big Business and the manufacture of war material. 

And say I am asking to give you any idea of what is disordered Mrs. Robinson, and why this to prove, and what to material to discredit her, and of what all I wish to convey. But I am now very occupied, so forgive my big use as I am a member of somewhat several women’s organizations in Pennsylvania and have used up a great deal of energy because I cannot be idle and, also, am working at pinning down the D.A.R.’s part in this very dangerous mistake. 

Yours faithfully,
