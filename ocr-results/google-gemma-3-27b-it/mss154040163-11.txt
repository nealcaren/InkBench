My dear Steady: I thank you for his
letters and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs. Blinn. Thank you especially for the clip-
pings for as you suspect I am interested
in the outgoing East year, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention, “Series” Mrs. Sweet brought
a letter she had received from Effie Vance,
and she had described very vividly how
Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her
suffering thro’ Christian Science. Needless
said in Ch. Si. Mrs. B. was one of the most
generous and forgiving women I ever
met, and with the above had her markness
of character, as well as the rich sense, she was
a woman to be admired for very many estimable qualities.
