Dear Miss Blackwell,

Fram blessed with a
propensity to be always at something—You 
are something; still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as thus success 
epithet the might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do. The truth is, is hot, but beyond
creed to say nothing of deed, what resource she
was left but you. The other evening to see 
spoken of time as having done this and that
as nurse in the war; I was called on to admire
her. I feel to surprise, I admire what she did—
But must she not be a noble woman to do
so much. Then I said it so very well to use 
upon and she’d true, to doie good. Ho the 
only recommendation we can have, But really
I shook to see one who did not need to do 
recommendation to buon, seeing where one thinks
not how much he has done—of course, but how
much he is. 

I apprehend from talking, Greek, 
I curt no further, but you who understand it
Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
