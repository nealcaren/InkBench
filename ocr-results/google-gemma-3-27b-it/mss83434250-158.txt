From the New York Tribune.

The able argument of William Whiting upon the War Powers of Congress is producing an influence in quarters where it was not supposed that logic and truth could win support. The pamphlet is winning recognition as one of the positive instrumentalities for the suppression of the rebellion. 

Mr. Whiting is an eminent lawyer of Boston, who has won great distinction cases under the law in relation to patents. He has now brought all his legal acumen to bear upon the investigation of the subjects set forth in the title of his recent work; and the conclusions at which he arrives, by links of argument in which it will be found difficult to detect a flaw, are confirmed in the fullest degree of the constitutionality of all powers assumed by Congress and by the President in dealing with this Rebellion.

From the Washington National Republican. 

We find upon our table a book containing one hundred and forty-three pages, entitled “The War Powers of the President, and Legislative Powers of Congress,” in Relation to Rebellion, Treason and Slavery, by William Whiting, Esq. We recognize the author as one of New England’s ablest lawyers. The book exhibits great research, and it seems to us, is complete and unanswerable in the special work to which it is devoted.

From the Journal, Roxbury, Mass.

Mr. Whiting has made a cogent, clear, and convincing presentation of his ideas. He has examined each point which he treats with the insight of a man who has other ideas of statesmanship than those involved in caucus or congressional encounters. He has patiently consulted authority with which to fortify the convictions of his own judgment, and carefully collected facts which bear upon his argument, and with these has built a structure of Law and Constitutional Construction is the chief corner-stone, and Liberty the grand material of the entire edifice. 

We have no room at present to follow him in the detail of his argument. It is our hope hereafter to make extracts from some of his more pungent portions, as they shall be applicable to events closely impending in the future. With the intention to strengthen, not impairing, the powers of the government. He labors in the cause of Order and Loyalty. The reason he reaches the verdict of most patriots of our day, that these have at last become concurrent terms. We have been too little accustomed, previously, to find eminment lawyers making a practical application of their learning to all the vexed questions of the day—but now that Mr. Whiting has undertaken to make our sacred Constitution a shield for those who the most faithfully observe and defend its principles, the task is worthy of approval.
