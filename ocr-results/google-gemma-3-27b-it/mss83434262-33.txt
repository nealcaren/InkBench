visitors gave three cheers for the *Naubuc,* which were responded 
to with a hearty good will by the happy crew, who resumed their 
operations and pastimes.

BEDLOE’S ISLAND.

Crossing the harbor, the steamer pushed rapidly for Bedloe’s
Island, and we were soon ashore for a brief ramble. Col. Chas. S.
Merchant, of the regular army, received the ladies, several of whom
had resided on the island in the days of hospitals and of battles,
when Bedloe’s Island did good themselves with a stay of the party
being very short, they contended themselves with a hasty glimpse 
of the sea and of the harbor through the upper windows of the 
Colone’s fine residence. The Colonel’s family was gratified by the 
visit and unremitting in attentions. The donations to the garrison 
and patients on the island consisted of 400 baskets of strawberries,
2 baskets of cherries, 1 box of shortberries, 2 barrels turnips,
1 barrel beans, 4 quarters lard, 2 bags peas, 200 head each of 
cabbage and lettuce, and 50 bunches of radishes and beets. 
The garrison consists of the Sixty-second New York Regiment, 300 
muskets, and the “Permanent party,” beside some 30 patients.
The hospitals are nearly all empty and are soon to be pulled 
down. Everything is in admirable order, and as clean as a pin.
Dr. Philip Adolphus, U.S.A., is in charge. 

FORT LAFAYETTE.

Heading down the harbor our little craft was soon fairly on her
way toward Fort Lafayette, which forbidding structure was famous 
during the war as the prison of those who had committed overt 
acts of treason against the sovereign power of our government.
Passing Staten Island, whose beautiful scenery attracted the eye 
and refreshed the senses, we kept upon the even tenor of our way, 
enjoying the cool and bracing sea breeze as it came dancing over
the waves, from Sandy Hook. Sauntering passing steamers with 
shrill whistles, waving handkerchiefs to a mail steamship just 
coming from over the Atlantic, the passengers, no doubt, glad to 
see familiar land, and bustling toward the dock of Fort Lafayette, 
were we, at last, found ourselves at land, the plank was once more 
run out, or rather up, and the ladies safely floated upon the perilous 
ascent by Garning the interior. We were escorted through the Cor-
ridor by Lieut. Smith, to the quarters of Brevet Brig. Gen. Burke,
and in a very lawless and most comfortable room, we took a 
much-needed resting spell, and listened to a very sensible talk with 
the commandant.
