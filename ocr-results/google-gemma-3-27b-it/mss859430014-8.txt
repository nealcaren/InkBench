My Dear Daughter,- I hope
you are still getting along
alright. We are well, Frank
is still on the job, and 
keeping the house to summer
time heat, despite the nice
bright weather we are having.

They brought more cotton over
to church and waited here while
she was in service. 
Daisy was not feeling 
well, she had been to the Doctor
early in during the day. He gave
her a shot and she says it
she did not look well at all as

I will forward them direct.
much love from us
from mother 
Leona.
