A at the time I called on the COUNTESS of Warwick she had four children,
a son who was a war correspondent in the Russian army, a daughter who had
recently married Lord Balley, a small son six years old and a baby girl
just three months old. She shared me the photos of each of the children
excepting the baby, and those of whom had good looks from their charm-

"Will you be here next Wednesday?" the Countess inquired. “I again beg
early Wednesday morning, as I sail from Liverpool for home Wednesday after-
noon, I replied. “I am very sorry,” said the Countess; “we shall have the
closing exercises of the Agricultural College Wednesday. There will be speak-
ing and several interesting exercises which you would enjoy, I am sure. I
shall go to the school Tuesday and spend the night there. I wish you could
go too. You would enjoy a visit to Warwick Castle, I know. Everything in the
United States is new,” continued the Countess, “that I am sure you would be
interested in the ancient and Warwick Castle is a magnificent old pile. 
You will be in England again soon day will you met?” I expressed the hope
that I would. “If you came we shall again said the Countess, “write me what
while before you sail over come plan,” said the delightful gentlewomen. 

But nobody was more interesting and more wonderful than Samuel
Colbert Hayes, whose mother was a leading member of the well known Hayes
family of Ohio, and who is now managing a large estate near London. He is a 
man of college education, and, from what I could learn, is very successful in 
his work.
