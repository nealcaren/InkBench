I was dying to prefer my request that he would purchase Psyche and her
children, and so prevent any future separation between her and her husband,
but as I supposed he would not again attempt to make a present of Joe and
at least to any one who did not wish to be bothered with his wife and
children. In the evening I was again with Mr. O— alone in the
strange, bare, wooden-walled room of charity, which is our sitting-room, and
revolving in my mind the means of rescuing Psyche from her miserable
suspense, a long chain of all my possessions, in the shape of bracelets,
necklaces, brooches, earrings, etc., wound in glittering procession through
my brain, with many hypothetical calculations of the value of each 
whole being equal to the price of this poor creature and her children; and
then the great power and privilege I had forgone of earning money by my 
own labor occurred to me, and I think, for the first time in my life, my
past profession assumed an added dignity. I suddenly accosted Mr. O—, it was to
this effect: “Mr. O—, I have a particular favor to beg of you.
Promising me that you will never sell Psyche and her children without first
letting me know!” My intention to do remarkably, giving the option of 
so that he when he has taken it into his directing his eyes to you con
soct. until, completely by your will. Little indeed am I conscious of the 
entire sacrifice which the same effect. This, however, was not all.

Think, E—, how it fares with slaves on plantations where there is
no easy Englishwoman to weep, and entreat, and implore, and uphold for
them, and no master willing to listen to such appeals. 

CHAPTER II.

THE GOLDEN RULE.

“Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the 
prophets.”—MATTHEW 7: 12.

We consign them (the slave) to no heathen thrall, but to
Christian men, professing the same faith who, speaking the same
language, reading the golden rule, in its one sacred and unaltered 
shape; but as it is recorded—a rule to slaves as well as to 
masters.”—JUDGE WOODWARD’S SPEECH of December 13th,
1860, page 10, Democratic Edition. 

“It is said by some, however, that the great principle of the
Gospel, love to God and love to man, necessarily involved the em¬
ancipation of Slavery. Yet how should it have any such result, 
when we remember that this was no new principle, on the
contrary, was laid down by the Deity to His own chosen people
and was quite consistent with the holding of slaves?”—Bishop
Simpson's “Lectures on Slavery," page 14.

“The author of Christianity, after having discoursed on
forgiveness, benevolence, compassion, and brotherly love, declared
that 'all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
ye even so to them.’ ”—Rev. Dr. Adams’ “Essay on Slavery."

Before proceeding further, it is absolutely necessary to
understand the position held by the slaveholders of the South, 
and I cannot, perhaps, furnish a better exposition than by
quoting from the speech of a leading lawyer and statesman of 
Virginia, delivered before the Virginia State Literary Society in 
1856. He said: “Slavery is not a mere concession to the passions of 
slaveholders. It is a principle of Government, and a great poli¬
tical institution, and woven into the very fabric of our social 
system. It is as deeply rooted in the instincts of man as self-preser¬
vation, and as necessary to the preservation of our species.”
