My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to
congratulate the world upon having you in it all
these eighty years to inspire and lead humanity to
do its best advance freedom and civilisation.

You have been a recognised thinker and leader
for many fields where men and women are proud to
follow. My only regret is that the United States
has not yet had the courage to elect a woman to
the office of president. You have been my candi-
date for that high place for many years. How proudly
we should all have campaigned for you!

It is impossible to express adequately our
appreciation of all you have done for mankind. 

It whole world a great privilege and joy to
work in the ranks with you and honestly lament the
hours of the energy you have so kindly spent for 
suffrage cause.

With the highest esteem,

Sincerely yours,

Carrie Chapman Catt

The National Woman’s Party
New York, February 16th, 1936. 

just received requests that I write you the answer to some questions 
that she has asked so that you will review this letter before our 
meeting on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place, at present, in which to 
place its collection when it gets it and must raise a growth amount—
to provide a place and for maintenance. Because it cut my guarantee
this thing may collapse and I think philanthropists and library 
association I have pledged that this collection will be kept intact for 
twenty-five years. Very few good loyal supporters, will dominant by that time, owing to the quality of the paper and ink, but there 
will remain a considerable library which furnishes the source of infor-
mation for the Suffrage-movement.

The Congressional Library has accepted this library and is ready 
for it as soon as I can send it to them. They are just completing 
a large addition to their building and are cramped for space.
I have told the means Archives Committee that my collection will go 
to Washington. 

The Congressional Library is only interested in books, but the 
Smithsonian now already have three very interesting wreaths of 
licking cases representing the National American Suffrage 
Association. 

I have written Alice Stone Blackwell that we should 
of Lucy Stone’s own and since the equivalent in objects no record 
of importance. I have sent a copy which I will add to their library 
In addition to these collections I am personally known Mrs. 
B. R. Taylor, our modest historian to write a brief history of the 
National American Suffrage Association, as soon as a book hook 
can be found and unless something entertains and I fear, this 
history will never be written and will not materialize. 

I have written Mrs. Matthew T. Scott and stated she’s to encourage
the States to send on their original material. But I think as I 
expressed to you before that States will not volunteer their records.
