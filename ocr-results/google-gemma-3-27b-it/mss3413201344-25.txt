## SUFFRAGE IN ARKANSAS

**MOTTO AND POLICY OF THE 1880 LEAGUE.**
“For the cause that needs assistance,
For the wrong that needs resistance,
For the future in the distance,
And the good that we may do.”

**By Mrs. O. F. Ellington,** 
President Arkansas Equality League.

In 1880 an “Equal Suffrage League” was formed. This Association worked faithfully during the pioneer days with very few results, but they laid the foundation for those who were to come later.

The origin of this first League was, to say the least, unusual at the time, and found little favor in the minds of men and women.  Strange it might have seemed then to see women women march down Main Street to Markham Street, west several blocks to the corner of Spring and Markham, to the Ledbetter Hotel. This building was owned by Mrs. Clara Cox McMahand, the first President of the Association and then a woman of thirty years of age.

Two years of this work were dedicated to the use of the auditorium in the basement of the building had the use of a small room. 

This little band of workers, the first to join the movement were: Mrs. Clara Cox McMahand, President; Mrs. Anna B. Taylor, Vice President; Mrs. Elizabeth J. Hale, Secretary and Treasurer. 

The movement lay dormant for several years, until 1895, when a new organization was formed. This one was called the “Arkansas Woman’s Suffrage Association” with Mrs. Mary Semple Jefferson as President. 

The work was carried on until 1905 when the Association was again disbanded. In 1911 the work was taken up again, and remains active to this day.
