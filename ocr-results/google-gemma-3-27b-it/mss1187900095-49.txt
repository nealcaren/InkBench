pursue, and I trust I shall
have your approval as well as
that of friend Bassett.

Mrs. Blaine has been sick in New
York for two weeks, and the
doe not seem to get well. There
is much unrest manifested in
her condition.

I thank you for long and very
kind letter, and regret that I donâ€™t
feel well enough to pay to you
now all that I had it in mind
to pay when I began it. But we
get worked out even when we are
very young men ambitious to run 
a long race. 

With my kindest regards, 
Yours truly, J.M.H. Kline
