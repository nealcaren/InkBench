I will give another fifty. 
I have a feeling that I did not
send my check to the Cambridge
League for the National League.
I am enclosing a check for $50.00, if
I have already paid will you
destroy this check. My old check book
took it up.
I hope Mass. has been getting
some rain, enough to keep down
the forest fires but not been
deluged as we have been, it has rained almost incessantly 
the final since early May, from 
the final to nineteenth of June 
we had fifteen days of rain. 
Will probably be broke by the 
middle of July and will phone
to learn the amount of the 
funds.

Very cordially
Zara du Pont
