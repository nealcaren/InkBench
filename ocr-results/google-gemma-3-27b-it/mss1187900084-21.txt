Rev. Fred. Douglass

I have the honor to forward to 
you the publishes action of the Edenizer
Lyceum, as directed, and ask your
acceptance of the same as token of love 
and respect for your great acknowledged 
leader.

For the Good of the Whole People.
The Ebenezer Lyceum had an interesting
meeting yesterday afternoon, Mar. 28. At–
kinson, President, and A.E. Ryden, Secre-
tary. After the reading of an essay, sing-
ing of a duet, and listening to an address,
the following was adopted:

Whereas it is our duty to owe to every citizen
of our intelligent and virtuous act of public 
interest and benefit done for the good of the
community; and 

Whereas the Hon. Frederick Douglass has, 
through a long life, shown himself & been con–
spicuous in the council and wholesome advice 
and works of wisdom to a people needing 
courage for the good of the whole recognition 
by our country; now therefore

Resolved, That in the recent address delivered by Mr. Douglass before a large audience 
under the auspices of the Bethel Literary As–
sociation we recognize him as our orator and 
leader. He has proven himself a staunch foe to 
selfishness and falsely represented the cause of 
the colored citizens of our country to the 
general public for consideration.

Resolved, That we tender to Mr. Douglass 
our heartfelt thanks for his versatile pe–
culiar character & his services, frankly recog-
nize unsurpassed, in which, mostly, many 
would be easily convinced.

Resolved, That our Hon. Frederick Douglass
we recognize as a worthy example to our young
leaders--ever faithful and willing to be heard as
our “case” is presented.  He has always taken 
the “bull” by the horns, and is courageous to 
the cause of truth, justice and true constitu–
tional liberty. 

A.E. Ryden, Sec’y. 

Jas. H. Gildersleeve, Pres't.
