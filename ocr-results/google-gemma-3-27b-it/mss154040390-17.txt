with the policies of our own government. The only communists who
ever made any trouble with Mexico went there from the United
States and were sent back by the Mexican government.

The agrarian revolution in Mexico began in 1910, seven
years before the Russian revolution. Professor Hackett, of the University
of Texas, an elide and disinterested student of Mexican
affairs, has declared: “At the outset it may be said that 
the Mexican revolution, which began in 1910, was as inevitable 
as was the French revolution, and in the causes for that more 
celebrated European struggle lay in the history of France in 
divine right monarchy, as the causes of the Mexican revolution
of 1910 are to be found in the history of the so-called thirty-
five years Presidential reign of Porfirio Diaz.” I believe the
facts justify fully and completely the causes of the agrarian
revolution in Mexico just as Professor Hackett has stated it.

Let us look these facts in the face. They ought to
silence the lips of those who would have the American people
believe that Mexico owes any debt over communism. When
Diaz became President of Mexico in 1876, Mexico already had her
share of large estates; great haciendas, *latifundias*. During the
reign of Diaz he stole from the Indian communities of land,
some of it was disposed of legally and some otherwise. Some of 
it was sold to parties and some of it was given to political 
retainers and supporters. It is estimated that he dispose of was
about three times the size of all New England. The average citizen 
received no part of it – in fact, the small holders were
dispossessed and their property confiscated in order to enable 
the large holders to gather their acreage.

From time immemorial the Mexican villages have owned
their communal lands, their ejidos, averaging in area from
4,000 acres to 17,360 acres. These communal lands were used by 
the villagers for holdings, raising food and pasturing their animals.
These communal holdings were all that stood between the villager 
and complete peonage. These lands, comprising the best bio-
logical soil in Mexico, but Diaz broke up and gave the communal
lands to his political retainers. By that act he stripped the
Mexican peasants of their birthright.

From 1910 to 1920 there was revolution in Mexico.
Many battles were fought. The peasants, under the leadership of
Villa, Zapata and others, fought for the restoration of their lands.
And they did restore *some* of their lands, but not all. *The 
restoration of the communal lands the greatest step in giving the
peasants a reason to live and not to succumb to the appeal of
communism,* and the present government of Mexico is carrying 
on that work. President Cardenas has already restored 22,000,000
acres to the communal holdings.

It is also claimed that communism is on the increase in 
Mexico because the government has confiscated some of the 
holdings of the foreign oil companies. But that is not communism—
that is *nationalism*. Mexico has as much right to own her 
own resources as the United States has to own hers. And that 
is not communism.
