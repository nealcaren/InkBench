Sidney report – 1863

SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, APRIL 1, 1863.  *In pencil, with corrections & additions.*
HDR. Quarters 1st Lt Avery, 32nd Ill Inf. Vol. 
To Maj. Gen. Banks; & Recd. Orders on the 28th, directing me to report here & take command of the post, & 
act as Prov. Mar & assist Col. Hamlin, 27th Iowa Vol in order to fortify this place. 
We are now seizing this fort which is the main entrance to MOBILE. 
The position is not a strong one, being nearly level & is liable to be flanked. 
We have no more men than is necessary to picket, & patrol the settlements.  That is invested 
by Rebel forces within 6 miles above here – on the MOBILE & MONTGOMERY road. 
There are from 500 to 800 Rebels in our front, & many more are assembling.  The desperation of any 
negroes. They request that our rifle pits are within 500 of the Rebel works. 
Our pickets have several skirmishes with the Rebels.   The Rebels are attempting to cut off our 
communication with MOBILE.  Much more is known concerning communication.  We are very short of 
tools, & carpenters, but we are doing all we can with but little to work with.  The Rebels are 
planting torpedoes along the shore.  We have captured 16 torpedoes of the kind they use – 
(little boxes with a fuse casting in the side) - 
We have laid torpedoes in a shell 
on the channel which (use for boats of their gunboats)  Rebels have blown up very 
near to this post in several places -  The Rebels have erected batteries out of sight. 
Have built horse block & condemn BLACK TROOPS and the TOPPEDO?
