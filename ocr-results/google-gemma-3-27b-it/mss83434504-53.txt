TAMBO IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.                                                                                       ZIP JOHNSON’S RETURN.

But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, “Strike two.”                                                                  AN ETHIOPIAN SKETCH IN ONE ACT.
“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered: “Fraud!”                                                            
But one scornful look from Casey, and the audience was awed.                                                                     CHARACTERS.
They saw his figure grow stern, and old, they saw his muscles strain,                                                              
And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again.                                                                    ZIP JOHNSON, a returned Californian, rough and ready.
The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate.                                                              Dr. SQuozzle, a queer fish, fellow R. C. of Sturgeon.
He pounds with cruel violence his fist upon the plate.                                                                                  CUFFER, head waiter of the Railway Hotel.
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.                                                                          
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.                                                                             COSTUMES.
Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,                                                                    Zip Johnson. High heavy boots, corduroy trousers, red vest 
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,                                                                     too short for him, striped shirt, long grey coat. Wide white 
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;                                                                     wake or sugar-loaf felt hat. Very rough in his ways and tone.
But there is joy in Boston—mighty Casey has struck out!                                                                              Dr. SQuozzle. Suit of rusty black, black hat, white choker.
