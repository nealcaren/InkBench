THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
FOR THE
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Headquarters, Fourth Avenue cor. 23rd Street,
New York January 26, 1885

To - The Probate Judge of Hudson County, N.J.
Sir

I enclose herewith the Last Will
and Testament of Miss Ottilia Ossing, who died,
as I am informed in the City of Paris, France, August
21st 1884. I have decided not to offer the same for
probate because I do not propose to qualify as Executor;
but, in view of the fact of other persons having interests 
in the estate under the Will in question, I deem it my
duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no
obstacle to your entertaining an application for ad-
ministration on the estate with the Will annexed. 

I beg to state, however, that it is the intention of
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
on the terms of the trust mentioned in the Will,
to claim the property to which it's entitled.

Therefore the honor remains,
with perfect respect

Henry Bergh
President.
