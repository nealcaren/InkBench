either crime than a blessing. I would not, at any sacrifice,
by emancipate his race from the control of the Master. But I
would demand for the undoing of mortality. Shall the era
for that control I would substitute the authority of Law,
and thus restore the relative rights of all men—but shall not
carry out a principle which has long been dear to me as an
American citizen. I desire to see Slavery, with all its dis-
abilities and inconveniences, abolished—to see every human
being, whether white or black, placed upon an equality—
but I do not desire to see black men made citizens, or to see
them placed in a political, social, and civil life equal to your
own. The question is not merely of color, but of race.
There is, as yet, no evidence to show, that the African race
is capable of self-government. I have long thought that the
slow but sure process of absorption, or of emigration, would
be the only effective remedy for the ever-increasing difficulty
of the African race here. I do not perceive any practical
means of solving the question, but by these two methods.
To attempt to force their social and political equality is to
invite the destruction of society, and to open the door for
universal anarchy. I will give this subject no further con-
sideration. Is it as you have written your voice in favor of 
the ability of the African to become a citizen? If so, I 
beg you to reconsider your position. To make him a citizen
is to raise him to the rank of the white man—to give him all
the rights and privileges which belong to that race. The 
whole theory of our government is based upon the idea of a 
white race. It is a Government of the white man, for the 
white man. The question of citizenship is a question of race
as well as of color. The African race is not only a different
color, but a different race entirely. The difference is in-
herent, as insurmountable as the high mountains, and as 
everlasting as the ocean. It is a difference which cannot be
removed by any social or political changes. I hold that 
it is a violation of the laws of nature, and of the laws of 
God, to attempt to make the African race equal to the white.
Do not misunderstand my position. I am not advocating 
the enslavement of any people. I am not in favor of any 
wrong or oppression whatsoever. But I am in favor of 
maintaining the social and political superiority of the white 
race. I believe that in this lies the peace, the prosperity, 
and the safety of our country. But I must hasten to a 
conclusion. It is a painful subject, I know—one that is 
filled with sorrow and suffering. But it is unavoidable, and 
cannot be evaded. I have said what I believe to be the truth.
If you disagree with me, I am content to let it go. 

But it is, perhaps, more important to bring to your mind 
some more obvious than the danger of doing anything to attempt to 
or to promote specific regulations for the administration of
thing of government than the danger of doing anything to assist obligations & payments. For the lessons which have been so

wealth of those who have been thrifty,  peaceable & industrious
will be turned over to those who are lazy, spendthrift & dis-

desire? It is impossible to avoid making some important and 
momentous preliminary observations with the view of rising 
to the difficulty we unable to give you the distribution of the
wealth it will be necessary that you should examine a more 
entire scheme of the most important principles of political 
economy: and hence to give you a more comprehensive view 
of the whole subject.

A review of the system of regulations within the range 
of the present question will avail to give the proper settle-
ment of great issues. It is indispensable you will first seek 
to establish such relations as are generally understood in the 
relative conditions of individual excellence, & that you will 
suspend all intemperance influence. The attachment to any 
particular form of government is the source of the greatest 
evils. Without such preliminary discipline, it will be im-
possible. For until men are informed from what principles 
the true regulations of society derive their authority, they 
will constantly be exposed to the enthusiasm of false pre-
tences; & still more, to the unavoidable exercise of crude 
and unprincipled power. The persons who are likely to be 
selected for the administration of the public trust will not 
be the chosen of reason; but will be either the darlings of 
fashion or the favorites of ambition. These selected ¬of¬
ficers will be, of course, swayed by those very passions 
which, if discretion & prudence could, be equally avoided.
