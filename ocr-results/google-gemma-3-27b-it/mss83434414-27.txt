FREEDMEN’S BUREAU.

ing thirst for knowledge is manifested by the colored people; children give earnest attention and learn rapidly, and the adults, after the day’s work, often devote the evening to study. Marriages have been recorded and orphans supplied with homes to some extent.

SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.

General Rufus Saxton had, as you are aware, been during most of the war in charge of matters pertaining to freedmen in South Carolina. The operations of the war enabled him to visit Beaufort and St. Helena islands during the winter of 1864-’65, and I was pleased with the settlement, labor, regulations, and thriving schools negro refugees, which have been his direction and supervision. Several thousand negro found in existence under his direction and supervision. Several armies, were received by him, for the most part, in a state of utter destitution, distributed upon different vacant lands, and cared for until they became self-sustaining. Judging by his past success of the general’s fitness for a large work, I gave to his charge South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida temporarily. Colonel Osborne, his Assistant Commissioner for the latter State, met with a serious accident while en route to his post, which detained him for a couple of months. Owing to sickness, General Saxton was delayed in extending his organization into the interior. A few officers and agents, however, proceeded as early as June to Augusta and further west in Georgia. Lately, South Carolina and Georgia have been completely organized. From South Carolina reports from the interior of the State are replete with instances of violence and cruelty towards the freedmen—murders, whipping, tying up by the thumbs, defrauding of wages, over-working, combining for purposes of extortion, &c. From my own observation, I do not infer that such crimes and cruelties give a true picture of the state of society. Yet the criminal list is altogether too great to pass unnoticed. Already the antagonism between whites and blacks in this State is marked, and for the military force. The number of dependents drawing rations in South Carolina and Georgia at the end of September was 10,664; the number of schools, 114; number of teachers, 174; of scholars, 9,500. A very large number of contracts were made for last year by the military authorities, and more by the bureau. Those planters who have enjoyed the benefit of General Sherman’s march have been obliged to struggle against many difficulties. Some complain very heavily, particularly about the want of hands. There is a want of a more practical knowledge on the part of some of them as to how to deal with their labor.  The ability of the freed people to take care of themselves is much underestimated. Planters are unwilling to pay fair wages, and then complain that they cannot get laborers.  In some instances, laborers have been driven from plantations because they asked for just compensation. Colonel Saxton is using all the power in his possession to correct such abuses. It is difficult to ascertain the exact condition of affairs in many portions of the States under my charge. The country is sparsely populated and communication is difficult. I am confident, however, that with a fair administration of the laws, and a continuance of the protection now afforded by the military, the freed people will, in a short time, become self-reliant and contribute their share to the prosperity of the country.



I am, sir, your obedient servant,
R. SAXTON,
Brigadier-General, U.S. Volunteers,
Assistant Commissioner.
