ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, now that any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrimmeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to obtain a medical degree and another the first woman to be admitted to the bar in the United States.  Alone, she was the first Massachusetts woman to become a college lecturer against overwhelming odds, and throughout her long life she always insisted that women were considered an indecency; and throughout her life was one of the half-dozen great intellects in the nation’s movement, and the chief givers of its strategy.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from childhood in the "lady suffrage" movement led by her mother, Lucy Stone, the most famous orator in that early era of Woman’s Rights". Miss Blackwell was assistant or co-editor in chief of the Woman’s Journal, the leading weekly journal of suffrage from 1881 to 1912.  She was corresponding secretary for thirty years.  She was the head of the Boston and New England Woman Suffrage Association for almost twenty years. President of the New England Woman’s Suffrage Association. As Miss Blackwell’s chief work was the pen, often anonymous, she was not personally in the public eye as much as the platform campaigners. But her work of editing the Woman’s Journal and writing its editorials did more to shape public opinion, to conduct campaigns and to organize movements, supplied the trustworthy, solid, basic foundation of information, keen analysis and argument. Among members of her sex regarded as an outstanding ability, in the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom, as a brilliant strategist in planning battles and issuing instructions, and the strategy which she charted during the last decisive struggle won by final victory. 

The insurgent thus who won, she took up the task of educating and organizing the Massachusetts League of Women Voters, her work as a teacher, having been an active board member of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters. 

In line with her family’s pioneering interest in the field of women's education she has always had an ardent belief in individual liberty. 

Throughout these long years her sensitive humanity has made her responsive to considerations of strange opposition movement. About by the Armenian atrocities of the nineties, she became the founder of the American Committee for Relief and varied efforts to win public demonstrations and support she rendered into English verse “Armenian Poems.” To America’s understanding and recognition of the barbarity and the undefined problem.

Her husband, the late Rev. George Blackwell, a Unitarian minister, shared in her crusades for human rights and encouraged her public activities. They had one daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell, who died in 1950.
