**Ruth McComrick, Deneen Sound Campaign Stirs Attacks County Administration.**

COOK County is humming with the buzz of politics.   Senator Charles S. Deneen has stirred up a hornets’ nest in selecting Ruth McComrick, Evanston girl, as his campaign manager and sending her out to build interest in his candidacy for the United States Senate.

Miss McComrick, who has attracted considerable attention because of her youth and striking appearance, immediately started a tour of the county, visiting county officials and asking them for information relative to the administration of County Superintendent James R. McConnell and other county officials.

It is reported that Miss McComrick uncovered some facts that were not to the liking of the county administration and that she is preparing to make public a report criticizing the expenditure of county funds.

**Senator Deneen Says**
“I want to say emphatically that Miss McComrick is a capable and conscientious investigator and that I am thoroughly convinced of the correctness of the findings she may make. I have the utmost confidence in her ability,” Senator Deneen said last night.

**McConnell Fires Back**
Superintendent McConnell issued a statement in which he declared that Miss McComrick’s investigation was prompted by political motives and that her findings would only serve to mislead the public.  He also declared that the county administration had been conducted with the highest degree of efficiency and integrity.
