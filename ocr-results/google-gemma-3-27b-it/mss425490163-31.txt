**Letter Text**

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

Nor can I tell you how genuinely delighted I was to receive your beautiful letter. Yes, I knew that Oberlin was going to confer on you a richly merited honorary degree and I thrilled for all our alumni scattered throughout this land.  I heartily endorse your modest assessment of your gifts, your graces, and your accomplishments.  I thoroughly agree with the Board of Trustees of Oberlin College when I read the colorful, kind words of President Frank E. Littell as he said in part, “Your rare gifts of mind and heart have been a constant inspiration.”  We’re proud to number you among the distinguished alumni of Howard University, and we always rejoice in your sympathetic understanding of our problems with which you have always been so generously, so wisely concerned.

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

May we ask you to take a moment or two to read the enclosed leaflet which deals with one of our critical problems – inequality of educational opportunity for 10% of America’s citizens.

It is not too much to say that the major responsibility for supplying United Negro College fund rests with the college themselves, museums, teachers – from our 14,000 college students.

We are now writing our 2000 college constituents to mow [sic] those who will loan their offices for the conduct of campus drives. We must do everything possible to secure maximum support for these institutions which are courageously carrying on a program of uncompromising educational standards established & maintained despite discriminatory legislative action & other crippling handicaps.

Would you be kind enough to add your name to the list of outstanding Americans who are lending their endorsement to this vitally important movement?

Yours sincerely,

*   Mr. John L. Dunning
*   Campaign Treasurer
*   Urban League of Greater Washington, D.C.
