& sentimentalism?  Am what
could the Kenneth Reyniers, &
the members of the peers expend
their elegance?  Mrs Miller’s bus-
steamboat, Mr. Denlay & his wife
with me “in pass of a pilgrim”, 
& some logically “Mint Hamlet”
States citizens home a right
to choose their own makes & 
employment.  But the privilege of 
pleasure  & other comforts
are so totally disregarded.  Shall
we right be ended.  Shall 
the day when in the disguise
of prudence requires exact legal
justice with the demand for 
prompt distribution of grace in Rey-
nie, & my best wishes for
your wellbeing.

Very sincerely yours
Elizabeth Lady Allen Ives,
