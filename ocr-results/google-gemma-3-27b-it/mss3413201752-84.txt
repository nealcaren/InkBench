**APOLOGY**

A grandson reminded us that if we prepared a Quiz on only one book of the Bible yearly, if we were to complete our task we must live until we were 145 years old.

So we planned to hasten and put into one booklet the questions on Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. We were encouraged by kind words from friends like Mrs. Wendell Green who called our last, with story attached, “a carefully documented outline of an ancient story, in which social, economic, legal and religious problems are etched against a romantic background with an undertone of humor and with an overdone of challenging implication.”

When the Quiz on the last three books of the Pentateuch was ready for printing, too much was omitted that belongs to Church ritual and to criminal law often mentioned in current literature, it did seem long.

So the story of the Daughters of Zelophehad gathers up only some of the ethical teachings of the Great Law-giver. If you underline accurate citations from the Bible with a true-blue pencil and make no error, you will receive “Honorable Mention.”

We admit that the names of the husbands of the Daughters, Akar, Bekar, Dekar and Eleazar are not given in the Bible nor does the Bible tell us of the various conversations of the Daughters, as noted in this Dialogue. But why should not the girls have talked about the great Jewish Lawgiver, about their family property and their future husbands? 

Their marriages remind us of our own fifty-four years ago because ours was different, we were not honored by the presence of Mosés and Eleazar, but the knot was thoroughly tied by modern property law. Anna Howard Shaw.

The reader may wonder why we do not give a resume of the canon of the ancient historical books, the Ancient Canon is the child of evolution in the world of research. See “Newer Knowledge” in the Woman’s Journal.

**ZELOPHEHAD’S DAUGHTERS**

A Dialogue
in four scenes

Time: about 1452 B. C.

Place: Tent of Zelophehad in the Wilderness
Authorities: Num. XXVI, 33; XXVII, 1—11
XXVII, 12; Jos. XVII, 3—6 and I Chron. VII,
15 besides many verses from the Pentateuch.
Speakers: The five daughters of Zelophehad
Tirzah, Moreh, Hoglah, Milcah, and petted Tirzah.

**Scene I**

Milcah. This tent is the only home we ever knew, and we do miss father.
Tirzah. More than you missed mother?
Hoglah. Oh no, but you two were too young to remember her. Father made a pet of you, Tirzah, and was so proud when you had learned all the Ten Commandments.
Noah. We older daughters were taught largely by our parents but Mahlah has been a real mother and teacher of you younger girls, Milcah and Tirzah. Mother used to say that if the first child were teachable taught, she would be one of the best carriers of the younger children. You, Mahlah, have proved all your first born or family tradition, spoke of us as right for your tutelage, none of your condition need a guardian or a patron nor our Bumpus, as you know, vouchsafed no dowry for the maiden, owing to your good sense.
