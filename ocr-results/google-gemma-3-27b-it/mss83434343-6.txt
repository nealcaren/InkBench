three wounded. About the middle of May we had orders to go
to St. Augustine which we had but just accomplished when I
was ordered to report to the Head as clerk at A.A. Gens,
Office and so here I am this accounting to you for my
absence from the regt. which still lies in the healthy and
pleasant shades of the oldest town in the United States/ I
spent but a day an a half there after the move before I
here. I was charmed with the place and its historical
associations and could have spent much longer time there
very agreeably but I had to obey (end of page two)
orders and not inclinations. It is a paradise of orange
groves, flowers and shrubs. In the yard I noticed the date
palm and banana as among the tropical fruits grown here
while peach and pomegranate indicated a plentiful crop of
fruit in the season of it which I judge to be at least from
six weeks two months earlier than with us as the north from
I have been here the weather has come down on us a little
degrees) the thermometer in Dextus but stood 102
(degrees) the day. Dexter is clerking here in the same
office that Moore left to become adjt of our Supt. as you
may have heard. He took a fine leap up from a private to list
Lieut. and Adjt but I consider it a very worthy bestowment
of favor or influence. Sammy has come to be as tough as an
alligator and at meal times has almost as open countenance.
His company with one other garrison the Fort (Marion). It is 
a curious looking piece old pottery but I from the
material of which it is constructed. I should judge it stand
a considerable of a battering before it would come down. There
of late two little sands on the main have sharpened up our 
appetites for something glorious from vicksburg. We have 
four negro sergts in this Dept or parts of them besides the
54th Mass (colored) just here Col. James Montgomery of 
Kansas notoriety is in command of the 2nd S.C. vs. the other
nigh he took four of his companies (end of page three)
and struck the main Poctolay's swamp and guided by some body
“intelligent contraband” late we approached battery of
eight guns from there also I turned the RR bridge, tore 
up track to the cove? & took a mile of trestle work, tore
property to the amount of two millions of dollars. Secured
as prisoners to many to my memory and our loss was 
comparatively small. All things considered it was a beautiful
affair. You must write soon and let me know all direct 
from you as the news from home is always acceptable. 

I remain as ever Your affectionate son 
W.H.H.
