Mr. W. F. Anderson,
Real Estate Dealer,
Sharp Building, K.C.,Mo.,

Dear Mr. Anderson:---

It will soon be five years since we started renting the premises at 2326 Brooklyn. We have tried very hard to protect everything about the place and taking everything into consideration, I feel that we have done pretty well. Certain it is our ambition to keep the place as nice appearing as is possible with an old house. But we have gone as far along this line as we can, without some aid. There will have to be some papering done. The dining-room, the southwest bedroom, second floor and the entire third floor needs papering badly. Then the furnace needs definite repairs. The door will not close and to shake the grate is impossible. The discomfort of living in your house in winter where the furnace will not heat is past understanding except experiences it. The third floor is uninhabitable summer and winter. In summer it is so hot we are obliged to allow the girls sleep on the floors of the lower rooms, which make very bad for discipline, and in the winter they are crowded into the three rooms on the second floor because the third floor is too cold. 

This, Mr. Anderson, can be remedied by insulating the roof of this house and the North and West windows. We are having such a struggle to secure coal winters and what we get does us little good because the heat is dissipated before it reaches the various rooms. 

Then too, Mr. Anderson, the house needs exterior painting—it looks very bad, I feel that the rent we are paying entitles us to secure the requests we make herein—they are not unreasonable but absolutely necessary to our type
