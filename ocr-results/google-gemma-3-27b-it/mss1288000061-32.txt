Georgeville, P.Q. July 18, 1889
My Dear Mama & Papa:

Yesterday we went on a pleasant picnic to Fitch Bay. It was an all-day trip. We had an early breakfast, & then Mr. Holbrooks came over & we all piled into a little steam-launch, chartered for the occasion. It carries 25, & there were 25 of us. The engine divides it in the middle, with wood heaped up on each side (fency a steam engine run by wood!) & the back 

was pretty full of a young lass of a romp & lots of glasses, too. Jessie & Sadie, I think, are my favorites. We all had a glorious time.
