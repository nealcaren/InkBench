Boston Dec. 25th.

My Dear Mrs Dickinson, 

Your favor of 
the 17th containing a receipt
for Jane Kimball’s clothing –
came safely to hand,
and I should have
acknowledged its receipt 
at once had it not 
found both leisure 
and myself too ill to 
do even so.  Little we
are now thinking of 
holidays or certain sees;
it all succeeds one shore
by another.  Many Thanks
for your good wishes & 
have been sent to match
love to you & your Mother 
Ann Mackenzie
