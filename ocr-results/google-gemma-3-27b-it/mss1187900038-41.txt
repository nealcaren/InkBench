My Dear Aunt Morrison,

Re our return 
from our three months tour 
through France Italy & Switzerland 
and we spent a few days at 
Woodcote, before coming here.  King
Alfredâ€™s begun duty & the busy 
girls hard at learning better writing 
to be sure as always a good pleased
to receive one of your nice long
letters & the one dates May 8th
was as usual full of interest. 
I think you will have us quite 
in awe at adventures at the fortune
you describe as having taken 
place in Baltimore last Winter.
It was a mystery that you tell
I had conjured up, you think
I live to let fortunes out the 
trouble, to let the printed, to to 
remember how many travelled.
