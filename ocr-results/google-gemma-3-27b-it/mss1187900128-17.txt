I know not where to find pastime
for them, I appeal, do your judgement,
I have ever been friendly to the
Colored race, having lived many
years at Cape Haytien as the
Island of Hayti: when my husband
took a permanent commercial place
under the name of Wilson Lavelle,
& Co., he was known to the parent
President of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee, for the house of Orton, Laroche
& Co., One Nelson was also sent
for the United States and the
recognition of Hayti was effected 
by him.  I am under his order,
in the State Department. 
Be so kind as to write me as to 
influence the Colonel Opinion in the 
favor of the Colored people. 

Begging you to excuse me for 
addressing you I Remain 

Very Respectfully 
Francis L. Wilson
