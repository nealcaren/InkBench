Dear Mrs. Burden:

I canâ€™t let your note, about
Mrs. Blackmere, go unanswered, even
if the cheeks I wished to send
must be omitted.

I have always loved Mrs. Blackwell,
and in late years, beautiful friendship
especially. Her always, beautiful cheer-
ness and stable spiritual face are such
lovely additions to the great back-
ground of her life work.

It rings my heart to know that -
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.
There are so many who are, I am one
of them, myself, or of course I would
share in making the funds which you
are raising.  Being a stamp-collector,
is a most painful handicap, 
in every way, but it is in particularly
hard to endure, when appeals like
this come. 

Thank you for including me
as one of your friends, - which
I most heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett.
