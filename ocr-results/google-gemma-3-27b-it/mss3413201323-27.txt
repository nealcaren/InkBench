**In the first line that “an Ameri-** can” citizen is defined as “one’s country,” is the most ambiguous statement. The next definition is that a citizen is “one who is born or naturalized within the jurisdiction of the United States.” Evidently he has a very loose comprehension of citizenship. A man may love his country and yet not be a citizen. He may be a resident merely. What would we think or say if any foreign-born applicant for citizenship should declare in an interview that his country was “the land of his birth and the country in which he is now residing.” There is a considerable difference between loving one’s country and being a citizen of it. Certainly, a government should know exactly who its citizens are. It is a very simple thing.

**Senator Hoke Smith Wants an Income Tax** 

Washington, May 23. – Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia today introduced a joint resolution proposing an income tax tax as an alternative to the present excise tax on liquors. He said this would inure to the benefit of the government and would not be a hardship to the people. 

The legislative demand for woman suffrage is spreading throughout the country and the legislative session of 1879 several states have granted women the right to vote in school elections. Since then, the movement has steadily gained ground, and in 1893, in the state of Washington, women were granted full suffrage. In 1896 it was granted in Colorado and in 1910 in California, Oregon, Arizona, and Kansas. In 1911 and 1912 the movement made considerable headway, but the legislatures of several states voted against the measure. The most recent state to grant women suffrage is Illinois, where a bill providing for full suffrage was signed by Governor Dunne on June 25, 1913. 

**When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage** 

The most notable of all the incidents  of  the debate during the session of the Iowa legislature in 1879, however, was John P. Irish’s speech in favor of granting women the right to vote on all questions of taxation.  He  said  that   women   were   taxed   without representation and  that they should have the  right to say where the money raised through the taxes they pay shall be expended.   

It appears that women, or at least certain classes of women, had not always been taxed in this state. He cited a case in his own county, where a farmer was taxed to support a school to which his daughters did not attend.   The speaker expressed himself as favoring  a   measure  of  this kind and  felt   that   taxation   without representation could not be sustained.   For   many   years   previous   to 1879  Mr. Irish had been the leading figure in the government of Iowa.  He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1858 to 1869 and a member of the Senate from 1870 to 1879.   He was speaker of the House in 1866-67 and also president pro tempore of the Senate in 1878-79.    He was a publicist and orator of great learning and his endorsement of the principle of equal suffrage carried weight.  

The suggestion, made by the Council Bluffs Nonpareil, that John P. Irish was a "stump orator," is an unfortunate one  and  indicates   a  lack  of appreciation of the great qualities of this man. He was noted for his ability to master and present a large amount of information in a clear and convincing manner. He made several speeches during his career that are still remembered by those who heard them. Mr. Irish was one of the most prominent and influential figures in Iowa history, and his support of suffrage would have been a valuable asset to the cause.  

**The civil rights** that are granted to women, they say, are merely a concession, and that they must prove their worthiness before receiving fuller rights. But they have already proven their usefulness in the industrial world, and they have also demonstrated their ability to participate intelligently in political affairs. The arguments against granting women suffrage are based on prejudice and are not supported by facts. The time has come when women should be granted the same rights as men, and they will not be content until justice is done.
