My dear Mrs. Catt:

May I thank you for your delightful letter as well 
as for the $100. check? I sent the latter to Mme. Baumann, 
our International Treasurer, and I am sure it will cause much 
rejoicing in our ranks.

With congratulations to the judges of the award 
upon their discriminating choice, and to you upon your method 
of expenditure, I am

Faithfully yours,
Jane Addams.

Hull House, Chicago.

The entire world is poorer because of the 
passing of that great and noble soul, Jane Addams. 
She strengthened, encouraged, and cheered the right 
side of every question. Just, logical, and unafraid, 
she has changed the thinking of the world on many 
questions. Instead of grieving for her passing, 
let us rejoice that she has lived. 

Carrie Chapman Catt
