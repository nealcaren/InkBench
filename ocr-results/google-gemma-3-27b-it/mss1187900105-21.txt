ands of dollars, which they insisted he must pay before the relic
was taken away. Finally he obtained an official order from
General Alexis to take possession of the relic, but the ex-
Minister of the Interior, whose name he does not give, immediately
seized the anchor, concealed it on his own premises, and informed
Mr. Ober that it had been decided to send it as a part of the
Haitian exhibit to Chicago. These facts I communicate to you
confidentially in order that you may be fully posted as to what
has occurred. But, perhaps it would be well before taking any
official action to await Mr. Oberâ€™s return. I am expecting him
very soon.

Very sincerely yours, 
Millarame E. Curtis
