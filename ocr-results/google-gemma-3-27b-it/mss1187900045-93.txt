we make use. Heaven
bestowe, their blessings - 
farewells are now said yet – 
one cannot forget their countenances
& the heartfelt goodbye – my mind
fully that I move in grace – 
supply. & favors Divine unt’t
they show’d, & comfortable, 
& numerous, & heart-touching – 
the way. Not difficult – we shall 
have much through this –
trial, but “all things”
with good religions 
by the grace of our Lord
we reach Philadelphia to take 
fix’d a hole highway - the 
back in ole boy the list 
prison Sad, how we will
seem the list – Heaven’s rather
than on prior peace, & so 
pray you preserve always 
your vessel – still & in 
affectionate your, S. G. Caps.
