that after a battle of two hours they (the
“Northern forces”) were repulsed, leaving
“many dead and wounded, and that order
“and tranquility reigned in the South.”

“We shall have on the 19th a mass of the
“10th from Portan Prince via Navassa, a cable on
“20th via Cuba and a mass again on the 25th
“inst.” – I continue to believe that the 
“forces will raise the siege and 
“retract to the North, proclaiming perhaps
“secession, and that the unfortunate plate
“of things will continue for six months.

“If the Government of Cleveland and Harrison
“had acted in good faith in their rela-
“tions with Hayti, this war would not have
“lasted…” I ask myself, is it would not 
“be well for me to go to Port au Prince with
“Mr. Douglass to see if the two parties content-
“ing cannot arrive at an honorable understanding.”

Now, my dear daughter, this letter is already 
long that I must cut it short right here. 

I am sincerely and very cordially yours,
Wm. Bassett & Atty.        Edw. B. Bassett.
