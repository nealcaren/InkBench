Somewhere in your mind there is something that you want, and perhaps need, that $100.00 will buy. Please get it for yourself and remember that it came to you out of a free gift which I received from the Pictorial Review. It comes to you with a memory of affection and admiration established many years ago and continuous to this day. 

I wish you would write me of your daily life. 
Tell me all about your [?] and neighbors and all the little happenings of 
your day. I am quite alone now as you know, and spend the greater part 
of my time in wondering as to whether you are well and happy. I am 
getting along very comfortably, and I am very grateful for all your
kindness and good wishes. Do you remember old Dr. Smith who used to
practice medicine with my father? He is dead now and his wife is
living alone. I have never been to see her since his death. I 
understand she is very feeble and quite alone.
