feel what I am growing old, 
and not now what I have
been - although time does 
been quite generous with
me - you will see by 
this letter that it burdens
for me to write now then
in old times when my
nerves were steady 
and strong - Give thy 
kind regards to your
wife in which my good fate 
hastily joins. Excuse this 
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your 
friend and wellwisher
James H. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see
us - I say Amen. You have 
now an engagement not 
fulfilled.
