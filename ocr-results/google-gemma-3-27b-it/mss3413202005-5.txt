171.

When I first saw the light of day on this planet, It seemed as it I had been rudely awakened from a deathlike sleep. How well I remember the conversation between the doctor and my father as they handled me over to the nurse.

I remember looking back at my mother's face at that moment. The look of pain and anguish on it was burnt into by plastic brain, and often during my boyhood I would watch as she suckled me. 

"Such are the ways of Nature," they tell me, as she is the source of all her creations, and becoming her failures. 

"I remember well how the wildest rovers, when her lips were coming full of childly years, and the message it gave her from the soul in wonder,” I recall those first know some subtle power of transmutation, seeing, feeling, even then the very first moment I seemed to know all the future without being able to give any expression in words."

Victoria never doubts any sketch about being a woman of destiny. In some autobiographical draft, written in 1906, in London, Victoria recalls years for behind her, she told of a vision she had soon in her childhood years and the message it gave her from the soul in wonder. 

“I remember,” she said, “from night till all are silent, the great soul within woos me to its embrace. so she never felt alone, but always in communion with the Majesty." No amount of wealth, honors, or power ever elevated Victoria beyond that simple communion, and before her country and its people she was always as humble as she was strong.

To Victoria, as to most of the great leaders of the world, opposition was a stimulus but never a defeat. She had the finest speaking voice and the gift of extempore debate in her time and always delighted in a fair fight. And she was a master in the arrangement of the sentiments best calculated to win when an opponent had to be overthrown. 

So how should Victoria see and hear the conditions of the working people of England? Industrial confusion and a terrible suffering lay thickly over the land. She had heard the cries of the children within the factories, the men and women working from twelve to sixteen hours each day, while many of the workers were living in hovels and existing on the verge of starvation, and could herself see the results of inhuman conditions. She had heard of the agitators and disturbance makers who were threatening to tear the heart out of the British empire. 

Victoria saw the necessity and the opportunity. She never believed in passing resolutions or feeble promises, in the face of realities. The man in possession of power with her had to act. The realities must be met, and met as soon as possible.

Any way the innovation upset the city of New York, Reporters camped on trails of Victoria and Temmy. Leaders of the curious public flocked to the halls where Victoria condemned. The turbulent aristocracy met the compliant. Soon, it was hottest about that they had the Financial backing of Commodore Vanderbilt. 

Gambling gave afterwards an argument for votes for women and presented it to both houses of congress. It was referred to the Judiciary committee and printed as amended, Victoria’s contention was that by the 14th and 15th Amendment, men were citizens and had the right to vote.

On January 12, 1871, she argued her case with great eloquence before the Judiciary Committee than none suffrage at burning close fear to upon the attention of the country. She also delivered pamphlets as to argument.

Thus formed Victoria's converted, the middle class into the suffrage fight. In the election of 1871, in New York city, with her full authority, she went to an election bought her poles as Sheriff and tallied the votes. Her ministry through and insists that we can tally their votes.

Mrs. Tilton and an appropriate committee of ladies and gentlemen were assigned to investigate the ballot. They reported that the ballot was very fair and that Victoria was always herself standing by as requested and only did what was necessary to keep order and prevent fraud. 

This was the closest, and at that time the most important legal contest ever fought in the history of woman suffrage and was lost by 200 votes.   

But Victoria never became discouraged. And she lived long enough to see her cause triumph as the results are seen by the daily papers. 

She began to preach the idea of a national organization. As a result was formed the National Woman Suffrage Association, with its first president at Elizabeth Cady Stanton. 

Victoria Woodhull now retires her claim as a candidate for president, and the next issue to be heard of her was in 1872 when she initiated the crusade against the city hells in New York City, that were often called the worst concert saloon.
