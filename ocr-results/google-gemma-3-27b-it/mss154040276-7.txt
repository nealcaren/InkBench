My dear Mary:- 

I feel perfectly ashamed for not having 
written to you all these weeks since I am staying 
with our dearly beloved Chief.  However, this seemed
to be so much to do the each day and I did not
want to send you a hurried note but a real
letter full of details which no one else could 
give you.  Mrs. Catt reads me parts of your letters 
and is both much interested in your lovely
trip and is so glad you are having such 
a grand time.  You certainly can give the United
disciples of things and we much enjoy the
amusing spirit and wit.  Well to begin with 
the beginning.  Before I came I was certainly
very worried about Mother Catt and I just could
not omit the day to laud them.  I came on
a Tuesday Afternoon Dec. 8th And the dear
Lady was waiting for me on the platform in 
New Rochelle.  Think can imagine what the first 
two days there was very very much to talk about 
and is tell. The dear Lady just poured all out 
to me and it seemed to relieve her greatly although
there were many tears, still fell she liked to tell
