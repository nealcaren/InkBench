In 1861 the people in the mountainous western counties of Virginia 
strongly opposed secession. When the rest of the State voted overwhelmingly in a statewide referendum on May 23, 1861, to withdraw from the 
Federal Union, the loyal western residents, in a series of conventions at 
Wheeling, voted to “secede” from Virginia and set up their own State. The 
bill for admission passed Congress on December 11, 1862, and on June 30, 
1863, by Presidential proclamation, West Virginia became the 35th State.
For years, however, many Jefferson County residents refused to use 
“West” as part of the designation.

Harpers Ferry never recovered from the devastation of the Civil War. 
Staring at the stark chimneys and charred remains of once impressive 
buildings, one of the townspeople concluded: “This place will never be 
anything again unless the government rebuilds the armory—and it is 
doubtful if that is ever done.” The Government never did, and the ground 
on which it stood was auctioned off in 1869. Mills and factories remained 
closed. The railroad did a small percentage of its previous business. Hopes 
for a renewal of the town’s former prosperity were dashed in 1870 when a 
flood destroyed or badly damaged nearly every building on Virginius 
Island and along the south side of Shenandoah Street. Subsequent floods 
destroyed still more of the town and ruined the Chesapeake and Ohio 
Canal. The canal was finally abandoned after the flood of 1924. 

Inundated too often by high water, the residents of Harpers Ferry 
eventually left the old buildings in the lower town and moved up the 
heights to the high ground of Camp Hill and toward Bolivar. For years 
the old shops and stores, those that remained, stood empty, neglected, and 
deteriorating. When Harpers Ferry became a national historical area, the 
National Park Service began an intensive campaign to preserve the fragile 
remains of the 18th- and 19th-century industries, homes, churches, stores, 
and shops, and to restore much of the old town to its pre-Civil War 
appearance, a time when it was at its peak as a thriving, bustling 
industrial community and transportation center. 

Today, while much of the old historical town remains, few of the 
structures that figured prominently in John Brown’s raid survive. (See 
maps on pp. 29 and 30.) The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridge across the 
Potomac, by which Brown and his raiders entered Harpers Ferry in 
October 1859, was destroyed by Confederate soldiers early in the Civil 
War. More modern structures span the river now, at the site of the original 
wooden bridge. The shops and homes that lined Shenandoah Street have 
been, as they were a century ago, largely dismantled or destroyed. The 
original armory, too, passed from the pages of history. 

Despite its apparent slumber, Harpers Ferry is not dead. The 
Federal Government has breathed new life into the town, and the steady 
stream of visitors—more than a half million annually—have given the 
old town a new, if somewhat artificial, prosperity.
