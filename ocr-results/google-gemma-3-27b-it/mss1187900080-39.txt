Dear Sir
I am an Ex Union Soldier and
have endeavored to be a con-
sistent Republican ever since 
the organization of the party 
I have resided in the South a
greater portion of the time
since the civil war and in
any humble sphere in life
have been a friend to the
Colored race. It certainly seems
to me that the curse of absolute 
slavery is still rests upon the 
country and fears horribly
upon the colored race, 
aside at present.           s86
