MOONEY AND BILLINGS

there at 1:50 P.M. That was my recollection of the time, and I was 
and am very sure that was the time I saw the suitcase placed there.

About a week before the trial of Thomas J. Mooney, Assistant 
District Attorney Ed. Cunha said to me, “You had better make the 
time you saw the suitcase was set at 1:30 instead of 1:50.” 
“You see, if the suitcase was set at 1:30 that would give them time to 
get back up Mission Street, on top of the Eddy Building,” which was 
about a mile away from the place of the explosion.

Before the trial of Tom Mooney, Pickert told me that Cunha was 
going to try the case, and that I should go through with Cunha, and 
act under his instructions; that perhaps there would have to be some 
small changes in my testimony, but that they had a man who was worth 
over a $100,000 and that he wouldn’t back up everything I said. 
After I left the witness stand and was in the District Attorney’s of-
fice I heard one of the clerks say, “Osman was on the witness stand.” 

Before the Weinberg case came up Cunha read over my testimony 
to me and said if you ask if you saw an automobile at Stewart 
and Market Streets that time you say, “Yes, I think I did,” and 
if they ask you what kind of a machine it was say, “I think it was a 
Ford.” After I left the witness stand in the Weinberg trial Cunha said 
to me, “Why in hell didn’t you say you saw a machine? It would have

Judge Griffin’s Appeal to the Governor

San Francisco, Calif., November 14, 1928
Hon. C. C. Young, Governor of California,
Sacramento, California.

My Dear Governor—When you discussed the Mooney case some 
weeks ago with a group of citizens at Berkeley, you told us that until 
then you had believed Mooney and Billings guilty of the Preparedness
crime. Some days afterwards, when you sent a message to the State 
Federation of Labor at Sacramento, you said again that you believed 
them guilty. 
I believe that you are as anxious as any other citizen of California 
to see justice done to these two men, and will give serious attention 
to the documents in behalf of their pardon. Because I believe that, 
Governor Young I am asking you—before you make your final de-
cision—to let me know what evidence has led you to believe that 
Mooney and Billings really committed the crime for which they were 
tried and convicted and are now in prison.
The thing that happened on Preparedness Day twelve years ago 
was a terrible crime, but I am sure that you will also consider it a 
terrible crime to keep two men imprisoned who will be most un-
fairly, even criminally, convicted—and that you will wish to give 
those who believe there has been a miscarriage of justice every oppor-
tunity to present their case to you in the light of the transcripts of 
any inquiry made.
A frequent and honest twelve men testify, its conclusive 
evidence—their honesty has been borne out. With the testimony be-
fore those jurors, who valued their oaths, Judge Griffin has done his
duty by ordering a new trial. Especially is this true when the ex-
pert bomb experts all agree any explosion was not caused by the
bombings alleged in the State’s case. 
I am believing that an open, complete and earnest study of the
case will bring you to a conclusion which will do honor to your office.
