FREEDMEN’S BUREAU.

The friends of the freedman claim for him a weight of intellectual brain equal to his white
fellow-man. A number of the medical officers interested in the cause are, when opportunity
offers, investigating the subject, and it is confidently expected that from this source, as well
as others, many interesting statistics will be added to the archives of the bureau.
The officers of the medical staff in charge of the districts are entitled to great credit for
efficient administration of medical affairs, a result anticipated from the facilities made by these
gentlemen during the war. The cordial co-operation always given by the officers of the other
staff departments of the bureau has relieved embarrassment and encouraged me in my official
labors. 
In concluding this report I beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the facilities at all times
afforded by the Commissioner to the medical branch of the bureau.
I am respectfully, your obedient servant,
Surgeon United States Volunteers, Chief Medical Officer.

The breaking up of the old plantation system has necessarily left the sick
with little or no medical provision except that existing among the freedmen
themselves. As soon as they earn money and become better versed than now
in the ordinary means of self-support, they will doubtless secure the necessary
aid.
The medical officers of this bureau at the best can afford but partial relief.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Of justice.—As all matters relating to refugees and freedmen were committed
to my supervision and management by the law, and as the old void codes in the
several insurrectionary States had become practically null and void so far as
they related to the negro, it became necessary to lay down some general rule for
the officers of the bureau concerning the administration of justice. At first I
confined myself to the following instructions:—
“VI. Simple good faith, for which we hope on all hands from those concerned in
the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve the Assistant Commissioners in the discharge of their duties towards the freedman, as well as promote
the general welfare. The Assistant Commissioners will, everywhere, declare and
protect their freedom, as set forth in the proclamation of the President and the
laws of Congress,
VII. In all cases where there is an interruption of civil law, or in which
local courts, by reason of old codes, in violation of the freedman, discounted by
the proclamation of the President and the acts of Congress, discover a negrogrowth,
the responsibility will remain with the bureau.
We cannot and will not permit the Negro to be reduced to practical slavery, and
will, to that end, apply the supervision and the assistance we are authorized to
render."
It was soon discovered that the terms "simple good faith” were too vague, and
did not sufficiently protect the freedman. Supplementing these instructions I
issued circular No. 11, dated July 19, 1865, a copy of which is appended.
The condition of the freedmen is every way encouraging. They are willing to
work, and with fair treatment and just compensation, will contribute their share
towards the rebuilding of the devastated States.
