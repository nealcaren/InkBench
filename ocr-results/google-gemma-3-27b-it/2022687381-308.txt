PROSPECTUS.

The American nation, embracing in its origin the elements of civilization found in all other races, has, as a portion of its manifest destiny, the taking to itself of the Good and Beautiful, wherever found and in whatever land. Civilization progresses westward, yet it cannot be independent of its sources. As we avail ourselves of the scientific improvements of other races, or as others avail themselves of ours, so should there be a mutual enjoyment of the advantages to be derived from the intellectual labours of those great minds which have conferred glory on their native countries and on the world. Every great writer is invariably a cosmopolite – one who thinks and labours for the whole world, and there is no part of that world, which has not a claim to enjoy and profit by his labours. 

German literature is rich in great and genial poets, who well deserve to be made known to every one in our own continent, who claims to be well-educated or informed. Genuine classic literature is the best and most appropriate reading for an intelligent and independent public – is the old friend, a calm pleasure, the middle-aged man’s incentive to earnest thought and action, and the young, a guide to that enjoyment of the beautiful, to which their eager, intellectual and physical sense is so keenly alive. Being convinced that both mechanical preparation of sound classics, works, and having been still further induced, by the representations of those engaged in instruction, of the necessity of such an undertaking, have determined to give to the great names of German literature a home on American soil. Since the twenty-fourth of March of this year, I have been publishing in my *Volksbibliothek,* or “Popular Library,” the works of HENRY HEINE in the original text, and in weekly numbers. With this number, I began the publication of what I believe to be a translation of extraordinary merit, of the Reisebilder, or Pictures of Travel, by CHARLES HELAND, Esq., the talented translator of the *Pictures of Travel* is already known to our literary public for one who is himself immersed in a thorough understanding of the spirit and mind bent inspired with worthy, is to comprehend possibly, and as to render brilliant after, and in another words, the sense of a poet, and a writer. 

As this is the first month of the endeavour, already, the sale has been more than encouraging, and I am, therefore, induced to publish this Prospectus, as an announcement of my intentions, and a solicitation of that portion of the public who value genuine intellectual and moral light, to patronize a publication which aims to bring within their reach the richest treasures of German literature, at a price which places them within the reach of all.
