September 28, 1890.

My dear Soupass:

On my passage through
New York yesterday from Phila. Stone & 
spoke on Friday evening, I called at Mum-
ford & Co’s office and enquired about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is what the clerks
in the office around me said: 

The steamer is the “Orange Nassau.”
She will sail from Pierpoint Stones (along
side of the whole street ferry) Brooklyn,
on Friday next, 4th instant at noon, for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on this
information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the 
“Orange Nassau” is the poorest steamer of the 
line. At she is steamable and sound and
guess we can stand it for six days on board of 
999
