Excerpt from letter of Mrs. Catt
to Mrs. Maud Wood Park, in regard to
“Women and Now” Dec. 6, 1944

**Carrie Chapman Catt**
18O Park Avenue
New York

July 14th 1944.

My dear Mrs. Park;

After a three weeks’ stay in the hospital and four weeks at home with a nurse in charge, Mrs. Catt is trying to get back to normal living – dictating some letters, but I could see that she had done enough. So I told her that I would write a few of the old friends and tell them that she was very much improved in health and that she would love to have a letter from them. 

She is now able to see people and although we limit the number per day and the length of visit, usually she is enjoying seeing her friends one more.

Mrs. Slade and Mr. Abel Russell are to come out tomorrow afternoon, we are prepared to have a very quiet cup of tea.
Just as the weary as the progress of the news of the European war serves in the warning of the interested person or the cares of the war game, but still keep our heads up.

Yours faithfully,
[signature]




When I was eighty, they gave me a birthday party in New York and it was arranged that I was to make the only speech. They suddenly asked for it and it was not finished. When they got it, it was with the intention of having it printed, but I did not know that. I have been informed since they brought two days to get it printed. It was brought into the room where we were all having tea and I had finished speaking. Then, Mrs. Slade made an announcement about it and called it a birthday cake which they had planned to have but changed it for the printed pamphlet which they proceeded to give out to those attending the luncheon. It never had occurred to me to see how correct or incorrect it was and only the other day, in going through the stuff that had interested me, - I came across a copy and looked it over and found it full of the most terrible mistakes anybody could have put in it. A little fussy but the sense remained. For I had given away alot of them, which was virtually assuming that I thought it was correct. I have certainly been blushing ever since. And, we, ourselves, make errors like that in writing our own history, how can we expect the coming world, not yet born, to earn know the truth about it?
