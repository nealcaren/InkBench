**RECONSTRUCTION:**

**A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE L. STEARNS.**

ELMER, SALEM CO., N. J.,
Feb. 27, 1865.

GEORGE L. STEARNS, ESQ., Boston, Mass.

My Dear Sir, - I lately received from you a communication, which you advance certain propositions, as my advice and consent in support of a land policy for the recently emancipated people of the South. 

I have given the matter considerable attention, and without further preamble, will state my views. 

First: I entirely concur in the necessity of some governmental provision for the comfort and security of the freedmen. They are destitute, ignorant, and without experience of self-reliance. To leave them to the tender mercies of their former masters, would be an act of injustice, and would inevitably result in their oppression and degradation. 

Second: I agree with your premise that the best, and indeed the only reliable, method of securing their rights and promoting their welfare, is by giving them a piece of land—a home— to cultivate for themselves. I believe that ownership of land is the most potent guarantee of civil and political freedom, and that the simple possession of a home will invest the freedman with a dignity and independence, which no other measure can bestow.

Third: I fully endorse the principle that the lands selected for this purpose, should be the abandoned plantations of the rebel slaveholders. It is just, equitable, and consistent with the demands of retributive justice, that those who have been engaged in the rebellion, and who have reaped the benefits of slave labor, should contribute a portion of their estates towards the support and advancement of the very people whom they have so long oppressed. 

Fourth: I appreciate the importance of providing the freedmen with sufficient means to enable them to cultivate their land until they are able to realize a surplus. The simple gift of land, without the necessary implements, seed, and other supplies, would be of little practical value. 

Fifth:  I understand that you propose to effect these objects through a Congressional appropriation, and that you desire my cooperation in urging such a measure upon the attention of Congress. 

I cheerfully comply with your request. I believe that a judicious and well-considered land policy is essential to the success of our national reconstruction, and that it holds the key to a lasting peace and prosperity. 

I am aware that there are objections to this course, and that it will encounter opposition from various quarters. Some will argue that it is an infringement upon the rights of property, and that the government has no right to confiscate the lands of private citizens. Others will contend that it is impolitic, and that it will create a dangerous class of independent voters in the South. But these objections, in my opinion, are founded upon narrow and selfish considerations, and do not carry with them the weight of moral or political reasons. The right to confiscate the property of rebels is clearly recognized by the laws of war, and the necessity of protecting the freedmen is paramount to all other considerations. 

The central idea of your proposed action—that is, to secure the rights of the emancipated, is vitally important. The noble and generous impulse which prompts this measure, commends itself to the judgment of every right-thinking man. It is a necessity to preserve the national honor, and secure the blessings of liberty. Forty acres is of little worth—without the means to obtain bread and water, and the land. The right to these elements is fundamental because they constitute the elements of the human body, which could not for a moment exist without them, and because God created them for the common use of all—not for the use of a single class or race. It is also important in the common interest that the capacity of the rising race be so developed as to make them useful and helpful citizens. 

The plan to employ responsible supervisors—competent and trustworthy—is the best feature of your scheme. 

I have been thinking much of the possible results of this measure, and I am convinced that it will not only elevate the condition of the freedmen, but will also have a beneficial effect upon the white population of the South. It will compel them to recognize the rights of their former slaves, and to treat them with respect and equality. It will also promote industry and enterprise, and contribute to the general prosperity of the country. 

I shall do all in my power to advance the cause, and I trust that Congress will respond favorably to your appeal.

Yours with great respect,

WILLIAM HEIGHTON. 

P.S. - I notice in your letter that you speak of the large amount of confiscated lands already in and under the control of the Treasury Department throughout the South. Also mention the action of the North Carolina Commissioners, as they visited this state, who inquired if assistance of a negro bureau could be toward their organization— stating they were fearful

**In a conference held by Secretary Stanton**
**and General Sherman with the colored people**

**take care of themselves?" he replied**
**" the way we can best take care of ourselves**
**is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own**
**labor." His advice is the most sensible we**
