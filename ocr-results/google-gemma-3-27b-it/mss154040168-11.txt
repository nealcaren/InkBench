with enthusiasm. Key has been much 
appreciated - more than you can know.
Sam longing to hear what is going to
come, how and when. Sam as ignorant
as a mild reward. Sam beginning 
to worry with the mailâ€™s need for you then
Panama after Christmas should be your
home the hub. Emma & Cohen arrive.
Letters are a luxury where we are.
I learn that mail is not carried by 
this boat to N. Y. but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you will
get this soon. I must be collective letters
as one to you. It must go to dress me. 
Sam & I magic the meltdown & is 
in store. Lovingly C.C.
