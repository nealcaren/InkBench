THE WOMAN CITIZEN

Your Investments 

TWO policies issued by insurance
companies which are “very popular”
and which are more or less on the en-
dorsement of Clergymen are our dis-
cussed in an income bonds, and re-
tirement benefits.
Many women- and men too—of
course—who have no dependent on them
and who do not provide themselves
with savings for retirement needs an
income in the future, find the purchase
of income bonds a convenient means of
adequate security. The purchaser
receives a fixed annual payment, after
which payments the insurance company
for the rest of her life. Should she
die before reaching this age, the in-
surance company readily agrees to re-
turn to the heirs the total of the deposits
which have been made. And
even if the purchaser dies after having
reached the stipulated age and received
some of the income payments, but not
the originally equal to the entire amount
of the aggregate returned to her heirs.
The cost of these bonds varies
greatly depending on the age or the
purchaser. A woman of thirty-five
years of age may secure an income of
$300 a year, and a woman of fifty years
of age will receive a smaller income for
the same total investment. However,
the income bonds are assured and
guaranteed by large and responsible
insurance companies. 

Retirement benefits are even mor
attractive because there is no time limit
for the enjoyment of the income. The
purchaser may live to the age of ninety
or over, and as long as she lives the in-
come continues. This plan is also
popular because it easily adjusted to
the means of the purchaser.
