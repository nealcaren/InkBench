My dear Dr. Catt:

I rejoice at the recognition which the
Pictorial Record through its committee has given
my dear friend. I think I am not interested in 
the sum of money that was your “prize” but the 
recognition is what intensely pleases me, because 
to my mind there need have been no contest on this 
subject at all; you easily could have been chosen 
by popular vote if there was one and I am very happy
it. However, it is very fine and I am thankful for it. 

I hope you are quite well and that there
may be a few fall flowers in your garden or there
may be some trees which have not yet dreary veil 
their summer clothing. 

Lovingly,

Grace Raymond Hebard

Years Young.    (¥30)

Not the least interesting part of the story of
Mrs. Catt’s distinction as winner of the $750
Pictorial Record achievement award is the way 
in which her fame has come to be known. Dr. 
Burrage of the Laramie Republican Boomerang, 
in an editorial, showed that on no occasion did she 
have to speak to the cause of suffrage in 
his paper; the paper expressed his admiration 
for you in the very way it had possessed
yourself in the great hours of marvelous victory.

Homer, a singer, have both in hesitation in
mostly deciding at that in this year, 1930, the
American covenant may do more for science, art, 
philanthropy or social welfare, Mrs. Mary Catt, 
Those who have the privilege to be occasion-
ally in Mrs. Catt’s parlor are coming to 
learn that the Mistress still has upon her 
becomes all the vigor, the quickness and the 
charm which effectively endowed her public life.

My dear Dr. Catt:

I am enclosing herewith an editorial
written by Mr. F.S. Burrage, owner and editor of
the Laramie Republican Boomerang. Mr. Burrage
opened his paper for the cause of suffrage during
the hectic days and gave unlimited space in 
his paper to the cause of suffrage. He has quite 
frequently in the past expressed his admiration 
for you in the way that you have possessed 
yourself in the great hours of marvelous victory.

Lovingly yours,
