MEMORIAL SET UP
TO DR. EMILY LEWI

Friends of the late Dr. Emily
Lewi presented a check for $14,000
yesterday to the trustees of the
New York Infirmary to start an
endowment fund in her memory.
Income will be used for the care of 
ailing woman physicians and their child- 
dren.

The check was presented to Mrs. 
Frank Vanderbilt, president of
the board of trustees, by Dr. 
Marion Manter, medical director of 
the infirmary, at the end of a 
meeting of the trustees in the 
Fuller Building, 997 Madison Ave-
nue. 

Mrs. Vanderbilt said of Dr. Lewi:
“She was one of the first doctors
who had the courage of their convic-
tions to devote themselves to the 
uphold the conservation as a center
of training and treatment for women 
doctors. Without her work and 
that of her associates the infirmary 
would long since have closed its 
doors.”

Dr. Lewi, who died two years 
ago, was a pediatrician who prac-
ticed medicine in New York since 
she came here in 1898 to 1936.
She was known as an outstanding
teacher and diagnostician and was 
one of the pioneers of endocrinology. 

The money raised for the 
infirmary building will be known
as the Emily Lewi Memorial 
Endowment Fund. - and that

Monday next
