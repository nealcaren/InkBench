Dear Grandpa:-

I have learned with
much surprise, that you are still
in the city of Hackensack enjoying
an extended leave of absence from
your post of duty, I am very glad
that such a leave has been granted
you, as I know that you are far
happier in Hackensack than any
place you can go and I only wish
that matters could be so arranged 
as to allow you to remain in this 
place.
