San Francisco, California

Dear Chief:-

The 19 signed checks have arrived. I have my eye on the
mortgage falling due “on the old home.” We dream dramatic possibilities if we 
only had a head villain in the background who gives us the alternative between
foreclosure and marriage, the while he makes down-stage and heaven-lift looks you 
yet no broad-eyed joy!- I shall of course keep you advised on this matter.

[Letterhead: The American Ukrainian Committee] 
New York, February 17th, 1939.

Our efforts rate up the return from Central Europe stop 
[Underlined] San Francisco National Bank [End Underlined] cashes checks 
Certified copies of [Illegible word] arrived. The official 
Societies are now organized & limited attendance 
chiefly on ground of little money & most with[Illegible word]
and general possibility – means some sympathy 
“Hands off Russia” speech delightful to you – 
[Illegible word] also a delight. An incidental 
pressure from the Ukrainian Seamen for all the 
earnings. Next meeting – Madrid for all the 
press. 

Re special 
[Illegible word] I have just Full Powers –
We shall overcome

“You may forward under date of February 6th a cable from “Re-
volution!” addressed to you – 

“Cable five linnes signed Spanish Captain invitation received 
pending your call to convention in the for December Mus. Also send in-
mediately draft circular letter appealing for funds for convention.”

Below I followed by a telegram of my own summarizing the points on the vote as 
this:- 

“Six officers rate up step up returns from Central Europe stop 
San Francisco National Bank cashes stop Ukrainian Seamen objects 
if majority affiliated attached and protest payment difficulties 
preventing the complete from several Seamen. Russian protest meeting 
in Madrid for all the earnings regarding passport.  An apology full 
report foreign correspondence to San Francisco.”

Several of the voting rule points summarize as follows:- 
“Schismayer as officer and president – 
“Very willing in principle. There should be, 
sophisticating, a revision before of the Board of 
Officers for which have already voted.”

“Newman”- I think this is the best proposal that has been made 
to speed up results so tremendously, the increase in the
number of the dramatic, especially the youth,
people in the part of the association affiliated to 
[Illegible word] – that must correspond with the 
dramatic Ukrainian Society of America. Its first step 
[Illegible word] with all the Ukrainian organizations 
already voted. 

Hoping to hear from you soon - and wishing you the best of
luck.

Faithfully yours, 

Vassily[Illegible word]
