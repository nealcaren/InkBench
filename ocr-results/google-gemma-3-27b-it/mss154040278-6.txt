Jean put us “Oldag” alluded the
Prague & W. Bohemia & Modřikarny
among them and along home
night brought a blue dress and 
received a caller.

I’m hoping the war will end
in the South East and that the Czech

Nazis home where all last me
will commit suicide.

Then we must bargain & my mil

Grimary olden era of gym mil

Yours, Fondly
