I came to Boston on Nov. 8
maybe a ghost visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone. I have been very quietly, only
been to the Opera a few times. I have 
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken, though
not terribly easily. I thought I should
see you here this Spring, because the papers
said so, & it has been a busy winter, 
but Spring & violets are near the corner.
Lizzie writes me often, & is happy in
her bit of house-work made easy mostly.
But if she is what in, she protects
in over duties. That she frets, the home's
shapes. She has a power practical sense, &
keep her from every nonsense of things. Paints
easy.  Sam bids you trace â€“ always. 

Lovingly - Marion Day.
