I have a good vessel when 
I hear it !!!  I wish rather
her junior when Iâ€™m absent,
surely prefers mine when I 
have the same occasion to injure
at he -

I sent home what you
wanted to see that rough
& a letter for my western
friend but I enclose a 
copy - 

Goodbye 
again
with heartiest 
wishes for your health 
specially if you think of 
seeing the signs of a 
New England summer next
July -
