I was on the - 4 oâ€™clocker
bus then - the state you
were volunteered to sail
from Goodslyn? Well
whatever delay it was, I
alone elbowed to the little
steamer taking with
me a lonely looking
French, & flowers for both
we & you both, and was
told in broken English
that your baggage have
been sent down, and
that you would soon
arrive. & patiently 
watched each person.
