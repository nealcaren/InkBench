**W**ANTED, feminism in politics, Emily Newell Blair says. So, Miss Blair suggests that the old-fashioned, broad-visioned and temper-hopeful, confesses his apprehension in the recent organized efforts to be pessimistic and discouraged about the position of women in politics. Her conclusions are drawn from seven years’ experience and hard work as vice-chairman of the National Democratic Committee. 

Her report is not a complaint, but instead of being taken as a dis–couragement, should be regarded as a challenge to measure the women engaged in political activity, determine their aim, their methods employed and the results wrought.

What has happened in one party has also occurred in the other. The remedy is the same. Miss Blair’s suggestion that the feminism in politics is the comment of the other party also. Miss Blair says there are two ways to make in which women may promote their interests, and build up the power she regards as essential. One is non-partisnship - not allying themselves with either side of the coming effective as a political organization. Either or both calls for more tension. 

The feminism a revival of some–thing we once had – a brand-new attitude for which modern politicians have no personality, while it is responsible for the most helpful, and in distributing patronage to whom patronage is due, in all the frauds and tricks that enter into the making up of the more terrible of political politics, the men who fancy themselves are the national governors were always our equals and often our masters.

**Q**uite the years passed. Votes were granted (almost) women were engaged in political motivations, men degraded into politicians, promises degenerated into political shallow; men made promises to retain power – none of those promises so high that it must withstand competition investigation. 

But a continual recommitment to honest administration and careful consideration is forlorn. To-day we witness the necessity for a new–fashioned, long-sighted, political clean–up. It is time to be very stern with those who confess their adherence to the cynical theory that politics is a dirty game, and very certain to penalize the first far–away hint of dishonesty.

Wide cry from women of all parties that dishonest, covert, graft, or unconscionable profit is looked upon as the marvelous way to startle the nation and the world: it would arouse the woman’s ire and attack. It would put the right kind of men and women into office and take away the wrong kind of masculinity. Instead of the ageing or weak men and more women, the great need is a crusade on by the women and the repeal of ill-spent public money, and an occasion to penalize those not measuring up to with standards of honest administration. 

The revision of the political machinery to make it secure against a continued or recurring–the thing of dishonesty. The women of the nation must organize, formulate a platform, nominate candidates, and demand that both of the great political parties measure up to their standard and make a solemn platform to accept it.

**(Purchased office, just be 15)**

every purchase of all voters as a political crime and political honesty must be made the standard by which all parties and men are simply remedies can be applied effec–tive.

A wide cry from women of all parties that they will no longer support a party that is dishonest, covert, graft, or unconscionable profit; it would arouse the ire and startle the nation and the world: it would awaken the women’s attack. It would put the right kind of take away the wrong kind of masculinity. Instead of the more women of a more–honest and great need is a crusade on by the women and the repeal of ill-spent public money, and an occasion to the standards of honest administration. 

The revision of the political machinery to make it secure against a continued or recurring the thing of dishonesty. The women of the nation must organize, formulate a platform, nominate candidates, and demand that both of the great political parties measure up to their standard and solemn platform to accept it.
