EMANCIPATION AND COLONIZATION.

The city of Cármen has about 5,000 inhabitants; its aspect from the port is very picturesque and beautiful. Mariners, on their entering, may be guided by a fine fixed light in the Indian village opposite the place, which light can be seen fourteen miles at sea. The principal commerce of this town consists in the extraction of logwood, the annual exportation of which is from four to six hundred thousand quintals. The price generally ranges from 75 cents to $1 25, according to the demand, or the great or small supply in the market. 

The logwood is carried to Cármen in canoes of from four hundred to a thousand quintals burden, from Tabascco, Chicualá, Chumpán, the Ranchos cinta, passing through Palisada. The interior of the country is generally swampy, and its greatest production to this day is logwood. There is also in the interior of the country a large quantity of cedar, mahogany, and divers other kinds of fine and valuable timber, especially for ship-building; but, until now, they have not been an object of great extraction or exportation.

There are at present ten or twelve establishments for the elaboration of sugar and aguardiente (sugar-cane rum,) and with time these articles may be produced in abundance for exportation.

What is now considered as the territory of Cármen has about 20,000 inhabitants. 

If the country was more thickly peopled, so as to facilitate labor for agricultural pursuits, it would probably be one of the richest tracts of country in the world.

Steam communications could be established from Cármen to the rivers of Palisada, Chumpán, Candelaria, Mamanatel, and Caño de Tabaneco, by deepening a little the bars of these rivers, which could be done without any great outlay, and with lucrative results to any one who would undertake the enterprise. The distance by sea from Vera Cruz to Laguna is two hundred and seventy miles; from Laguna to Frontera de Tabasco, by sea, forty-eight miles; or to San Juan Bautista one hundred and fourteen miles, by sea and river.
