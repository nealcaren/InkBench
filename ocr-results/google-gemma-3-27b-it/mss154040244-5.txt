View to tell her about
The Leagueâ€™s progress.
We are meeting tomorrow
to come to definite
conclusions about the
design, inscriptions, &
for the Memorial tablet
in Washington on the wall
of the National House Roll
where are the names of
the fallen heroes placed.
Mr. Sloan & I have the
matter up to place at 
the time Washington is paid 
full gratitude - & any
concerning resolutions
& always affectionately yours
Nathan Turpin
