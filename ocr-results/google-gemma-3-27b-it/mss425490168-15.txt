PRESS RELEASE: For PMs, Thursday, March 30.

A test case on the District of Columbia anti-discrimination laws of 1872 and 1373 will be tried in D.C. Court on Friday, March 31. The case, “Dist. of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co.”, will take place on the 2nd floor, Municipal Court, Criminal Division, 5th St. between F and F Sts. NW, at 1:30 PM.

The Thompson Cafeteria at 725 14th St, NW is to be prosecuted by the DC corporation counsel for violation of the 1872 and 1873 laws against discrimination because of color in restaurants and other public places. Clark King will be prosecuting attorney. The complaining witnesses on whose complaint Mr. King is acting are: 

Harry Church Terrell —for two terms a member of the D.C. Board of Education; charter member, NAACP.

Rev. Arthur F. “Lmes — Pastor of the Peoples Congregational Church.
Miss Essaie Thompson — member of the United Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union
 
The witnesses were refused service at the Thompson cafeteria on Feb. 28, 1950 on the ground that three of the group are colored, by Mr. S.W. Becker, regional superintendent of the "Washington-Baltimore district of the Thompson chain.

According to a ruling of the corporation counsel, the law against discrimination in color in restaurants is now in effect, but no further prosecutions will be acted upon, although complaints will be accepted for future prosecution, until the courts have ruled on the Thompson case. Some restaurants have opened their doors to all patrons since the commission announced on Feb. 21, 1950, through the corporation counsel, that the law is still in effect. The “Washington Post-Star” has advised its members not to obey the law at present. 

An amicus curiae brief will be filed by the Coordinating Committee for the Enforcement of the D.C. Anti-Discrimination Laws, this group is an organized after the D.C. chapter of the Natl. Lawyers Guild published an opinion in May 1949 holding that the laws have never been repealed, and has been concerned solely with their being put into effect. The amicus brief reviews the lengthy and inconsistent segregation history in Washington. The suits brought by the attorney general and the attorney represented by Mr. King are the first to reach the courts in over 30 years.

The defense is represented by Elias J. Brecher, of the law firm of Friedenwald, Goldfarb, Reisler & Rosenblatt.
