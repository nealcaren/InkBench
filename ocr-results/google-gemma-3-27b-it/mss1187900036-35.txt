You know I expect
to go home soon - but when
will the time come.  My home
looks like other homes - and
now three have been
My luck.  Since I can remember

songs, formerly the sweeter
more exquisite the better
The short time I had here
in the west had little indeed
Which thought some problems
with your beloved & your
poor mother! One thing I
do the truth! though not
at the first trial - the potter
with both Wheels nor
matter if turned one the
where the shape have been
