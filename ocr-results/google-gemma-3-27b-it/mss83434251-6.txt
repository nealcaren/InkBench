war; very few old men and in the ranks very few boys. Our officers are
many of them boys. 

“We have some Negroes; but I look on them, in general, equally
serviceable with other men for fatigue; and in action many of their have
proved themselves brave. 

“I would avoid all reflection, or any thing that may tend to give
umbrage; but there is in this army from the southward a number called
riflemen, who are as indifferent men as I ever served with. These
privates are mutinous, and often deserting to the enemy; unwilling for
duty of any kind; exceedingly vicious; and I think the army here would
be as well without as with them.” —M. S. Letter, dated 24th October,
1775.

The following is an extract from the journal of a Hessian officer, dated
October 23d, 1777: 

“From here to Springfield, there are few habitations which have not
a Negro family dwelling in a small house near by. The Negroes are
here as fruitful as other cattle. The young ones are well foddered,
especially while they are still calves. 

“Slavery is moreover very gainful. The Negro is to be considered just
as the bond servant of a peasant. The Negress does all the coarse
work of the house, and the little black young ones wait on the little
white young ones. The Negro can take the field instead of his master;
and, therefore, no regiment is to be seen in which there are not Negroes
in abundance; and among them are able-bodied, strong and brave
fellows.”—Schlozer’s Briefwechsel, vol. iv., p. 363.

We next give an extract from an act of the “State of Rhode Island
and Providence Plantations, in General Assembly, February Session,
1778. “Whereas, for the preservation of the rights and liberties of the
United States, it is necessary that the whole powers of Government
should be exerted in recruiting the Continental battalions; and whereas
His Excellency, Gen. Washington, hath inclosed to this State a proposal
made to him by Brigadier-General Varnum, to enlist into the two bat-
talions, raising by this State, such slaves as should be willing to enter
into the service; and whereas history affords us frequent precedents of 
the wisest, the freest, and bravest nations having liberated their slaves
and enlisted them as soldiers to support their defence of their country; and
also whereas, the enemy, with a great force, have taken possession of
our capital, and a great part of our State, and our own people are so
diminished by a natural decrease, and hurtful luxuries, as to render it 
difficult to enlist a sufficient number of freemen to man the troops now
