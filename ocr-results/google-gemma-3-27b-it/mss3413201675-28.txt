## TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double

**By ELEANOR ROBERTS**

There are some things television does better than television next season if your viewers will think they’re seeing double. 

There is an experimental program, the first of its kind, to be aired next Friday night on the DuMont network. “Where did I leave Crosley—oh, the Back Room?” 

It’s a story of two typical American families—the Smiths with Martin and the Joneses with Dennis—who, through some technical wizardry, are linked in each other’s homes. Viewers will see the Smiths in their living room and simultaneously the Joneses in their own living room. The tale revolves around a missing Crosley television set.
