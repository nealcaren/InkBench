“Rosa Parks’ precious gift, often overlooked by youth accustomed to the privileges they enjoy, is a blessing as well as a reminder. Because she helped to make my world better, I too must make the same commitment. I know that her struggle would be in vain if I did not make the most of the opportunities made available through her action. It is my responsibility to ensure that I explore each of the doors that were unlocked through the actions of Ms. Rosa Parks and others like her.”

These lessons were ones I took to heart; began to believe that I could make a change in my community and my life, for the better.”

She has worked hard all her life to give me the best life a child could ask for, and has always encouraged me to reach for my dreams and goals. She instilled in me that if I put “God” first, and ask him to lead my path I would surely achieve them.”

Because of her sacrifices, I stand ready for the task at hand.”
