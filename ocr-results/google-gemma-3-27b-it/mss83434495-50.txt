and proceeded to bury the bodies as best we could. As we groped our 
way in the darkness, sometimes we could hardly distinguish a dead 
soldier from a section of a corn row, and would have to determine the 
matter by feeling with our hands. When we found a body we would 
as quietly as possible dig a hole beside it, roll on the body into the hole 
or grave, and then cover it over. As we went with the work we 
came to a spot where four men lay in had come together and died. 
They lay with their heads close together, and their bodies extending 
outward from the common center. Evidently they had crawled together 
before death came, and probably talking of their friends and homes, 
had died.

Decomposition had taken place in all the bodies, and the labor of 
burying them was most disagreeable in trying. My thoughts as I 
proceeded with the work were of a character that can never be 
described. Who the dead men were we were burying we never knew. 
Some of them might have been my neighbors at home. But that was no 
place for speculation, nor for indulging in sentiment. Our work 
was urgent, and we proceeded with it as rapidly as we could, until the 
last corpse we could find was covered from sight. 

Done within less than a hundred and fifty yards of the enemy’s breast-
works. John E. Barr, of Brookville, serving in the 105th Penna. regi-
ment, was in this charge that was made through the corn field. 

On June 20th or 21st our colored troops were put into the front 
line of works, and we held them until July 29th, when we were relieved 
to take part in the operations connected with the explosion of the 
mine on July 30th. We occupied the front line of works six weeks, at 
the point where the rifle pits crossed the road leading from City Point 
to Petersburg. During all that time we would spend three days in the 
front works, and then three days back in camp, alternating thus regu-
larly. There was scarcely a day when we were in the pits that we did 
not have at least one man killed or wounded. Some days they would 
number two or three. The work became very monotonous, and almost 
any sort of a change would have been hailed as a relief. At times we 
dared not put our heads above the breastworks, or we would be shot 
at. We had to go to the sinks after night, or take our chance in a 
fusilade of Confederate bullets. The sinks near our place in the 
line were in a little piece of woods, surrounded by a growth of saplings and 
small trees. These trees were marked by a volume of bullets that 
whizzed through them, or sunk into the trunks. It was dangerous and 
disagreeable work to go there, but it had to be done.

On June 20th or 21st, as stated, we were relieved by the 48th 
Penna. regiment, and we went into a camp of instruction and drill, in 
preparation for the movement against Petersburg—the *mine* explosion.
