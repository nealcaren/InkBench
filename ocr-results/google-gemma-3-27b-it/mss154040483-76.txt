## THE WOMAN CITIZEN

**Whose Government is This?**

**By Carrie Chapman Catt**

THE question for our consideration is whether the department of Federal Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it a part of the work of the League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less appealing to women voters, but for that very reason it is more necessary for women voters to comprehend its need. If any other department of the League should be dropped for example Women in Industry, Social Hygiene, Child Welfare, other organizations would be responsible for carrying on that work. But unless there were adopted by the League of Women Voters just such a department of Federal Laws, no other body of women voters would take it up.

We were enfranchised in 1920, and in the intervening years we have taught our lesson and there is no more talk of the inequality of women, none of this long, laborious work to do. The people rarely remember in any country how much laboring, patient effort has gone into the establishment of any right. They assume that rights are born with us. The department of Federal Laws and Methods had its birth during the dark days of opposing suffrage. From the first it has been a clearing house for information, a center of strategy, a quick and trustworthy source from which to send out facts. 

Here is the address made by Mrs. Catt at the Cleveland Convention when, at her suggestion, the Committee on Federal Laws and Methods, as one of the departments of work called Efficiency in Government. This speech was so full of an expression of the failures of our governmental machinery to register the people's wishes that it has been repeatedly asked for by our readers.

gram when necessities arose. The combination of these lobbies against suffrage has happened over and over again. Presumably the program was that of the darker interests; still every interest united in its support. 

It is sometimes forgotten what is known as the boss system or the practice of letting the state machinery fall into the hands of a few men or a boss who would not frankly say that they did not truly for honestly represent the majority. The system is not new to America, but it has been carried to a more despicable degree than even that of our forefathers. Our government is not a democracy but a representative republic, which means that we must have representatives who really represent the people.

These were two questions only in that campaign and there were so many others. It is difficult for the voter to register the opinion that were held by all the people. Many the very many of them felt that the vote would never be of any value to them. What happened then happens all the time. Because there is conflict between the state and the nation and because political machines and bosses do so much political juggling over issuesâ€”

Reform, therefore, is needed all along the line; but it is needed at the election of the President of the United States and all the way down to the dog-catcher in the smallest village.

**Where We Need Reform**

Perhaps we need at the most, in our platform making, Our Needs is a coming protest against the laws that give some man power in this land, so tremendous that theirs is the power to give or take away the right of the citizen to do as he pleases with his own property. All power is legitimate that rightly comes from the people, but all power that is not legitimately acquired is usurpation.

The time has come for the League to consider the question of a Federal Department of Legislation to work for a better system of laws and registration, and particularly for a Federal Registration Bureau, to overcome, as far as may be, the abuses now existing. The League must also take up the question of radio broadcasting and publicity, and must formulate a clear program looking toward the prevention of the misuse of these instruments as means of propaganda. The League must give its attention to the question of the financing of political campaigns and seek to bring about a system that will prevent the undue influence of wealth.
