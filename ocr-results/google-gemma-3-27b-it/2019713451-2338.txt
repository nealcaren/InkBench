not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be
sure the wrist does not touch; it should be the high enough from each surface to allow a holder 
to be passed under its right side.

**Third. CRITICISM**. Criticize the line written, by asking questions on each particular
given as knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The errors lie,
of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is curvy, it may be curved the
wrong way, or too much or too little; if closed, then too much or too little; the turn
will be too sharp, or too broad, or too narrow. Select one or two of the most prevalent
faults, discovered by the answers and by your own observation, for correction; direct
special attention to them, and have one more line written that they may be corrected. 
Then criticize these same points, see how many have succeeded in correcting them, and
write one more line. Thus, criticize the whole execution is perfected, and direct attention to
the correction of faults after faults until the whole is perfected.

**GENERAL RULES.** 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches 
both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the sides of 
the oval within downwards; the ovals, the second upstroke of a and a, and the second 
and fourth of m, &c. See Manual, Chap. III. The Connecting Lines are the rest of the 
curves written upwards. The Turns unite main to connecting lines. Sometimes the 
main and connecting lines unite in a point: this is termed a Connection. The line 
formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into one another at the 
middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 4. The odd numbers are used for the 
upstrokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are five Principles in the small letters, in the 
order in which they occur in the alphabet. There are six Principles in the large letters, from 
these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts, all the small letters are made, 6.
The red lines mark the columns, or units; which, is divided into three oblongs or "boxes".
Write down the columns always. 7. The membership to a base-line.

**N. B.** Teachers will find our Manual of Penmanship complete for comprehending the 
art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tablets are invaluable for explanation of
Principles and for practical exercises. The accompanying chart, on which these principles
are distinctly engraved, is an essential requisite for every schoolroom.
