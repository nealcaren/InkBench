Washington, D.C.
July 15. 1883.

Dear Grandpaps,

Your affectionate letter received 
12th. I hand we were very glad
to hear from you, and I know
that you are getting along
nicely.
Everything is passing along
smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times al-
most intolerable. It is now
about nine o’clock and the 
thermometer stands about 84 ½°.
Charlie says not lift yet!-
For the early rise & stretch and 
I doubt if either he will or 
I do. It seems the latter as 
I don’t have or Thursday anyway.
