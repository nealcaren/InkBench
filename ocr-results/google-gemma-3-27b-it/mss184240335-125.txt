I liefly freed myself by going to 
Boston at 16 years.   Could & wanted
to work & earn my own living. 

when I arrived at Boston I began to 
work at Mr. Manning’s where I knit
for two years. It was agreeable
employment.   It was there & through
him I learned to be independent. 
Then I went to knowly.  I found a 
position in a fancy box factory.
Also in a confectionary.   Had 
to work early & late to secure my 
living.  But thought it preferable
to living at home with that woman. 
I left there & did work for Mrs. 
Gilman’s grocery & provided my own room. 
& Board.   In 1877 I married

Samuel H. Bullock.   We lived in boothbay
Harbor & he was a master mariner. 
He followed the sea until his death 
in 1886.  We had three children. 
George, Elsie & Harry.   I have always 
been a hard worker & always tried to 
be honest.  There were times I suffered
for not having a home.  But I always 
found work & was able to take care of 
myself.  I am now in none health give I 
am turning a 90.   & I am spending my 
days in quiet & without a home. 
I have been a Unitarian- always, & 
believe in doing right & trying to help 
others.    Do not allow the past to trouble
or exasperate you, but try to look into 
the future with a sense of hope & peace.
