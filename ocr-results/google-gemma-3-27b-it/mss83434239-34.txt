Popeâ€™s Wells
May 1858 to July 1858. 12 to 15 miles northeast of the junction
of Delaware Creek and the Pecos River, southwest of Carlsbad.

Beginning in the spring of 1855, some 75 soldiers and 25 civilians under the direction
of Brevet Major John Pope drilled three water wells in an isolated corner of southeastern
New Mexico to supply water for a proposed transcontinental railroad across the southern
United States to California. Pope used a cable rig powered by mules and later a steam
engine to carry out the drilling operations. The third well reached a depth of 1,050 feet,
but eventually all three caved in, and Pope abandoned the project.
