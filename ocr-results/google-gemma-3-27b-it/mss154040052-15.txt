era may have so believed, but no one knows what the members of the two
organizations thought.” All I said was that the leaders of the two 
societies so believed. Look at page 249, near the bottom, and you will 
find that this was so. 

In describing the division, I followed the lines of the statement 
published by my father in the Woman’s Journal of April 11, 1877. That 
statement was written by me. My father preferred to put his name to it 
because he thought it would bring down considerable odium upon us from 
the old “Nationals,” and he wanted that odium to fall upon himself and 
not upon me. To his surprise, the odium failed to materialize. I don’t 
suppose the Nationals approved of it, but they seemed to recognize that 
that it was a moderate and not an ill-natured statement of our case. 
And they knew that we might easily have made it very much worse. 

You seem to think it a pity that the subject has been reopened; and 
I have tried to be fair, and to err, if at all, on the side of mildness. 
You must remember that a whole series of unjust attacks have been given 
to the American side, and there has been no chance back, except that 
one article in the “Woman’s Journal,” 31 years ago, which no one has 
read, and in which the injustice of some statements was pointed out 
in a manner before the public for down statements. 

The annexed is from a private letter to Mrs. Kelley, which I have 
her permission to allow to go into my forthcoming volume.

“Of course, I was not surprised to learn that my book had given 
offense to the English women for the reason that it necessarily opened 
old wounds. But I was surprised to learn that so many of them had 
been led to suppose that I had deliberately sought to cast reproach 
upon English women. I did nothing of the kind. I simply stated facts 
as they came under my, and as they were stated to me by others. 

organized mainly to boost the Republican party; that my mother’s order 
object seemed to be to oppose every term former friend,” Miss 
Anthony wanted to do and other things equally absurd. (These quota-
tions are not verbatim; I have not the book here, but that is the sub-
stance of them.)

After all this, when I wrote my mother's life, could it be reasona-
bly expected that I should not state her side of the case, in a matter 
where her motives had been so much misrepresented? 

It is proverbial that when a lie once gets started, the truth can
seldom catch up with it. This is even more true when the lie has got 
more than 40 years start, and has already gone all over the world. I 
am not sanguine enough to suppose that my belated book can counteract 
the version which has so long been current; but it seemed to me that 
the facts should be stated, if only in the interest of correct history. 
But I am truly sorry to have worried you so much. I too lay awake all 
night, the night after your letter came. 

I think your review does my book both more and less than justice. 
Mrs. Dorr has made her book. On the other hand, I do not think I have 
“idealized” my mother. But it is a difficult thing to surround any 
woman with entire justice. 

I do not know whether you remember my telling you, a long time ago, 
that the English women, as a rule, do not care for the truth so much 
as for the sensational. That is my experience, and I think it is a true 
one.

I am glad you liked my chapter on the history of the National Society. 
It was carefully worked out from the records, and is, I believe, accurate. 
But it is not likely to be popular with the older generation of English 
suffragists. 

Yours very affectionately, 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
