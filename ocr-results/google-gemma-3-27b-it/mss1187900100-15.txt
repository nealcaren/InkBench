Bailey Sen, Nov. 4th 1881
Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement foot here 
to move three thousand families out 
West. We are trying making every
effort to extirp the money. In the 
name of God we call upon you to assist
us & stir up friends to do so. How
this wale comes directly from the 
cabins of the poor oppressed downtrodden
& outcast Southern negroes & if the
northern people refuse to help us we are 
dead men without a hope. All we want 
is to get away from our oppressors & 
there we can Educate our children.
We have sent out several letters to remote 
friends & we ask you to do the same in
behalf of poor suffering humanity. 
For reference of writer address Hon,
C.B. Eaton Memphis Tenn, & PM at Bailey Tn.

Truly Yours W.H. Coombs Secâ€™y
