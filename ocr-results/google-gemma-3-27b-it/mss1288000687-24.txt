**ALICE STONE BLACKWELL**

An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, founder of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, a pioneer of woman’s rights. Her father, Henry Blackwell, was also a determined abolitionist and practically the only man who really desired women’s suffrage. Alice Stone Blackwell, who was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, took a medical degree and another. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, her sister, was the first woman ordained a minister. Miss Blackwell’s education was completed at Boston University in 1881, and then she joined her parents in working for suffrage and in publishing the Woman’s Journal, carrying the paper on alone after her father’s death in 1917. When the anti-suffrage committee of the Massachusetts legislature attempted to answer the anti-suffrage arguments, and a distinguished lawyer conceded that the reply was unanswerable, it was Alice Blackwell who brought together the facts to create the most convincing and controversial case that had ever been presented. 

Two parties of the suffrage movement weakened the woman's suffrage association in 1890 into the New England Woman Suffrage Association, of which she was secretary for nearly 20 years, or years taken for more recent organization into the League of Women Voters. For twenty years – 1890-1910 – she conducted the legislative work, and for thirty years the press work connected with the cause. Her ready wit, her persuasive powers, her entire personality, and her long record of devoted service have made her a leader in the public movements and organizations of the day.
