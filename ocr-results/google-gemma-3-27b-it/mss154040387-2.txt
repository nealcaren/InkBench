There is not an audience in this country nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the hearts of the people. There is not an audience before which a speaker may allude to international peace that does not respond. There is not another war all the world is willing to say that peace, but how are we going to get it? That is the practical question, and it is not only a question for us to decide in our own country, in our own states and cities, before we can act collectively with other nations, but it is for our selves individually to think our way through.

We don't settle that question when we have a million different points of view, but wait for somebody to act.

Everybody at this time is judged by what being non-partisan. I don't care a rap about being non-partisan. I am for disarmament.

I was for a Democratic League of Nations. I am for a Republican party or any other kind. I believe in taking action on questions of this kind and not waiting too long. It does not matter which its parties or who is President. Our country is not judged by today there isn't anybody in the world who knows what nation knows what we are going to do. But I ask you if there is anybody anywhere at this moment with an earnest crusading spirit who is campaigning to arouse America to lead in this matter. Oh, no! We are a stolid and indifferent apparently, and as inactive as though there was not before us the greatest question which was ever presented to the nations of the world.

It is a curious kind of psychology that is upon our nation. We have always been a nation in favor of arbitration. It was this country, I believe, that signed the first treaty of that character. We are a peace loving, and we believe in as a notion, then, are the people settling questions and not force. It will the toll on the appointed ones to lead in this question.
