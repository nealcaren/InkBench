*Mustered out of service.* 

Instructions were given to surgeons-in-chief to aid the medical department of the army in the care of sick refugees and freedmen, and to relieve Assistant Commissioners in establishing hospitals for such patients as could not be otherwise properly accommodated, and employ the requisite number of physicians and attendants to supply the wants of the sick. 

It was soon discovered that the want of Congressional appropriation, and the limited amount of funds at the disposal of the Commissioner for the employment of physicians and attendants for the sick, would embarrass the fulfillment of the medical department. 

The Surgeon General having authorized, in Circular No. 5, current series, medical surveyors to issue to the bureau medical and hospital supplies in accordance with the standard supply table which had prepared, and the Commissioner adopted for the use of the bureau freedmen, surgeons-in-chief were instructed to make application to the nearest medical director, with a view to obtain a supply of those articles. 

Instructions were given to surgeons to render, at the close of each month, a report of the operations of the bureau under their charge, embracing an exhibit of the number of patients treated, the amount of expenditures, and a full statement of the wants of the sick.

The following is a copy of the circular from the Surgeon General, U. S. Army, relative to issuing medicines and hospital stores to the Freedmen's Bureau: 

OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL, 
Washington, D. C., June 22, 1865. 

Circular No. 5. 

I. Medical surveyors are authorized to issue medicines and hospital stores to the bureau for freedmen and refugees, in the following proportions: 

For each 100 sick, requiring 30 days' supply: 

100 lbs. quinine,
50 lbs. opium,
25 lbs. calomel,
10 lbs. blue mass,
10 lbs. digitalis,
5 gallons alcohol,
100 bandages,
100 lint, 
100 plasters,
and other necessary stores in proportion. 

II. The issues will be made upon the requisition of a medical officer in charge of the bureau, stating the number of sick and the place where they are located. 

R. S. LAPHAM, 
Surgeon General, U. S. Army.
