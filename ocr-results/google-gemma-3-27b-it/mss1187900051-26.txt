CITY HALL,
East Rush, N.Y.
Rochester, N.Y., Aug 17 1897—

Friend Douglas.

I started from Rochester yesterday
morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake.
Bought at 6 o’clock I was in the swamp
a few north of the Rush Reservoir—
I attached a pocket instrument upon the
wire and communicated with the person
who took my place during my absence—
He telegraph’d me the substance of your
postal card, before I left home I read
your telegram, & went to the Roch. Sar. Bk.
where the dft was preserved— and notified 
them of its non reception, and if your wish 
for a duplicate, they said that they
could not give another until they have
mercy, which will form the clearing house
at N.Y., which will be the first week
