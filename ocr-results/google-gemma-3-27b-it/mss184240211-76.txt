Thursday –

My dearest – Lad as Rogers
sent that awakening letter back
the letter & Gen. Hart “Miles”
Dre. Kindly knocked at the

Of course she told me a lot 
of scent – & told her had

Call & Co., & Dalton – She
looked so small & frail & 
could hardly realize that she
had the spirit of Coke Mills –
