PRUSSIAN DELEGATION

ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS 
IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%
“Evidence of Moral Weaknesses
of German Race,” Berlin
Councilor Declares.

Vienna, Nov. 21 – (Associated Press) – Evidence of the moral weaknesses of the German race is seen in the fact that illegitimate births in Prussia now constitute 10 per cent of all births. This information is given in a report prepared by the Prussian Board of Statistics, for the information of the Berlin City Council, and has been made public.  

The report declares, according to a dispatch to the Berliner Tageblatt, that this increase in illegitimacy, particularly in the large cities, is a “disturbing sign.”  The most illegitimate births are found among laborers and soldiers, while the least are found among public officials.  

The report suggests that the war and the absence of men have played a large part in the increase of illegitimacy. The tendency towards illegitimacy, it is declared, is a sign that the family solidarity is weakening and will have detrimental effects upon the nation.  It says the councilors are agreed upon the approval of a series of measures designed to counteract the growing evil.

Causes of the War 

A dispatch from Amsterdam says that the Prussian Board of Statistics, in a report now published, analyzes the causes of the increase in illegitimate births in Prussia. It says “the most important and most general cause is the fact that the war has left many women without the protection of marriage.” The war, it continues, is responsible for the increase in “moral looseness.”

the entire German kingdom. It has
thus been estimated by Berlin officials
that the empire loses over 200,000 births
annually with the calling, as the result
of the war, of 500,000 men.
It is stated that the increase in illegitimate births is most pronounced in 
the industrial and military centers that
have felt most acutely the effects of the
war.
The suggestion that the evil has a
racial aspect, the dispatch continues, is
made with a view to convincing the citizens of the necessity of strengthening the
moral fibre of the nation.

A Berlin dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph says the Prussian government has
formally protested against the statement published by the Swiss press that the
German armies are demoralized.
