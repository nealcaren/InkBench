(FORM No. 19—Continued.)

NOTE 1.
The company commander will here add a statement of all the facts known to him, concerning the cause, manner, and place of disability of the soldier; the time, place, manner, and the disease contracted or which the injury occurred, or disease originated or aggravated; the duty, or service, or situation of the soldier at the time the injury was received or disease contracted, stating particularly whether the injury was received or the disease contracted in the line of duty; and whether or other facts may aid a judgment as to the cause, immediate or remote, of the disability, and the circumstances attending it.
When the facts are not known to the company commander, the certificate of any officer, or affidavit of other person having such knowledge, will be appended—as the surgeon in charge of a hospital, the officer commanding a detachment of recruits, &c., &c.

NOTE 2.
When a probable case for pension, special care must be taken to state the degree of disability—as § 4, G. O. No. 82, 1861—to describe particularly the disability, wound, or disease, the extent to which it deprives him of the use of any limb or faculty, or affects his health, strength, activity, constitution, or capacity to labor or earn his subsistence. The surgeon will add, from his knowledge of the facts and circum-
stance, and from the evidence in the case, his professional opinion of the cause or origin of the disability. In the case of discharges by Medical Inspectors, the last
paragraph will state, that the "discharge was given by consent of the soldier after a correct examination, and for disability, the nature, degree, and origin of which are correctly described in the within certificate."
