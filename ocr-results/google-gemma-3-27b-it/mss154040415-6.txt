in honest desire for peace, for perennial peace, their 
so much of the spirit of the caveman, with its cratti-
ness, its caution, its jealousy, and especially its faith, 
that the caveman’s side of the head do never permits
it ought to do. And so the nation composed of these
bifurcated-headed citizens fights bravely for peace, 
but prepares for war, and that is the way we are 
moving on. I am not one of those who believe that 
all the army and all the armament should be given 
up and that we should trust that everything will 
move alright. I only go so far as to believing that in 
these preparations for war we are deceiving ourselves
and deceiving our neighbors, when easily, comparatively easily, we could save the money, save the 
anxiety, save our self respect, by establishing world 
peace. 

There are at the moment four propositions which 
have been made for the abolition of war. I do not 
think that any one or all together would be sufficient 
to achieve this great end, but all of them 
have been proposals of Americans. It is a curious 
thing that today all the efforts that are being made 
to end war originated here and that we are not an 
active part of any of these efforts. As soon as 
we give advice to the world we back out and do 
not take ourselves. The first of these propositions 
was made by Benjamin Franklin when thirteen 
counselors, rebellious, complaining, hating, distrustful, 
come together and managed to surrender their 
individual judgement and logic and agreed to a com-
mon counsel. That is the reason why we are here 
today. The second proposition was that of the Czar 
of Russia, a meeting at The Hague to consider the abolition of war. It was proposed by the United States delegation. It was proposed by the United States delegation. It is called 
the American plan, but great jurists were not pleased 
with this court. It is an arbitration court as it goes. It 
has settled a number of troublesome questions, but great jurists like Mr. Root did not think the court was permanent enough. It was too ephemeral and too 
temporary in its character, so he for one continually 
talked for an international court of justice that 
should be a real court, a permanent, continuing 
court, and so the United States made a proposal 
that there should be another Hague tribunal in 
order that they might make this proposal. There 
this proposal, and all the delegates whose were 
in 1907 and 1911 united this proposal to one uni-
thing for 46 nations represented – voted uni-
mously for this court, but the countries not reached 
the result, the railway, it never realized how 
much it will cost, it did not have the means to 
carry it through. But the permanent court of arbi-
tration, the permanent court of justice, is now 
definitely established at The Hague. 

The third proposition, which is a very recent one, 
was made by Mr. Carnegie. Mr. Carnegie, with his 
usual directness, said, “Let us get rid of the 
armament.” He proposes to establish a fund from 
which to purchase all the armaments of Europe and 
to destroy them, and he proposed it in a very 
practical and business-like way. There were members 
of parliament. But this perennial fear of one’s neighbors always rose up-
permost and all the countries maintained their 
tremendous military preparedness and the minority 
change. But even it is suggested that for Europe 
eventually it may come into existence. There is 
nothing for us to do. It is a proposition for the 
Europeans, but it is interesting to note that this 
idea is still working in Europe and that it was 
American. 

The next idea in point of time was the world
court. When the Czar of Russia called a meeting 
at the Hague to consider the abolition of war there 
resulted from it the Hague Tribunal. It was pro-
posed by the United States delegation. It is called 
the American plan, but great jurists were not pleased 
with this court. It is an arbitration court as it goes. It 
has settled a number of troublesome questions, but great jur-
ists like Mr. Root did not think the court was per-
manent enough. It was too ephemeral and too 
temporary in its character, so he for one continually 
talked for an international court of justice that 
should be a real court, a permanent, continuing 
court, and so the United States made a proposal 
that there should be another Hague tribunal in 
order that they might make this proposal. It took 
place in 1907, and all the delegates whose were 
there for 46 nations represented – voted uni-
mously for this court, but it never realized how 
much it will cost, it did not have the means to 
carry it through. But the permanent court of arbi-
tration, the permanent court of justice, is now 
definitely established at The Hague.
