Dean Miss Blackwell - 

It will be very glad indeed to have you on the committee
even though you can take no active part. Enough Jimmie Higgins
turned up to do the work, & no reasonable person could
expect you to do the detailed work of the committee.
We will probably have a banquet as soon as we can get speakers
& place together, as that seems to be the time honored method of raising money.

The National Committee informs me that a broadcasting
station with license can be bought for $50,000. But they 
want to raise more, & partly to have an endowment to cover operating expenses in case the commercial users should attempt to 
boycott us.

Fraternally,
Alfred Baker Lewis
Sec'y.
