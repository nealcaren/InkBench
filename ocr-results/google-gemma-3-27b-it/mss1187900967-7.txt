were at your house! Nevertheless 
should you come, a father’s house 
a father’s home, a father’s welcome
will be given you. You would
find me in very pleasant company,
not quite such as I have on Cedar 
Hill.   Zeb very well adapted to 
this climate and country.  I 
note what you say of young 
Cooke. I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
But am more sorry since to 
know that he served from 
Dick a mean trick. She 
did a good deal for him. Had she 
done lust the she would have
received more thanks. Gratitude 
is not a very strong feature
of the Colored race,
