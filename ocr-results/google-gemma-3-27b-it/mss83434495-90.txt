toward the close of the war. The few days we lay in camp there witnessed a stirring and eventful scenes around Petersburg which culmin-
nated in Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, and saw General Joseph E.
Johnson’s army retreating through North Carolina, followed by Sher-
man. About the time we went into camp at Faison the battle of Ben-
tonville was fought, probably not more than twenty-five miles from us. 

While we lay in camp at Faison Station an incident occurred 
which in its result was quite important to me; and it was so unique in 
its character that I deem it worth relating briefly. Had the result 
been different I might not seem to tell the story. 

Although no enemy was near we kept a good picket line, for we did 
not know when he might appear. The Confederates had a habit of 
coming at unexpected times, and experience had taught us the neces-
sity of constant vigilance. We were short of lieutenants, and I found 
myself detailed one morning to take a lieutenant’s place on the picket 
line. At the same time that the adjutant had been detailed as brigade
Captain Riley of Company K that he had been detailed as brigade
officer of the day. I don’t question now but that all was right and 
straight in the transaction, but I felt at the time that I was being 
imposed upon. Officers in the army lay much stress on rank, and 
when I saw myself detailed to do a lieutenant’s duty on the picket 
line, and the captain of another company going out as brigade officer 
of the day, I thought I was not receiving fair treatment, and so in-
formed the adjutant, using pretty strong language. But my hot words 
didn’t change matters any, and we went out just as we were detailed. 

I was in charge of the men from our regiment, and fortune so 
arranged matters that we were placed directly opposite the head-
quarters of General Terry, then commanding our corps, and not more 
than thirty or forty rods from his tent. Soon after we went on duty 
Captain Riley, brigade officer of the day, came along the line, and in 
addition to giving me some general directions, instructed me specially 
that it was the order of General Paine, commanding our division, that 
no person be allowed to pass any portion of the picket line held by his 
men except on a pass given or countersigned by him. The order 
seemed unusual to me, and I asked him if he was sure he was right, and 
he said about it. He said he was not mistaken, and the order as he 
knew to me was exactly as he had received it from the division 
commander, and promptly rode off. I promptly called the men
together, explained the order to them, and instructed them to be 
particularly careful to enforce it, and to allow no one to pass without 
a pass, and as I did my duty to the best of my ability.
