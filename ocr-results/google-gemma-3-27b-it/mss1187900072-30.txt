Washington April 10th 1887

Dear Father

Your letter dated March 24th I 
received yesterday. It found us all well, and
I pleased to hear from you.
Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds is
seriously sick with pneumonia. Gerrit S. Boguen
tal, and was refused admission as soon as
he heard of it, he paid his bill and went to
another hotel. A colored man by the name
of Taylor from Kansas has been appointed
to the Siberian Mission. The political
air looks as present on the Republican side
is wavering between Blaine and Sherman. 
Congress has made an appropriation for a
new Bridge across the Eastern Branch – 
parer of Deeds.” The President and Mr. 
Matthews have been taken back in the
prompt Confirmation of Mrs Trotter. They
expected he would be rejected. Attorney
