In presenting the bell, Mr. Williams exclaimed, “Long live the Constitution! Long live the City of Philadelphia! Long live freedom!” Mayor Goode said he was “proud to accept this gift of freedom.” It is a reminder, he said, “of the fifty-five men who came together here two hundred years ago to give us the Constitution that has influenced the course of democracy around the world.” 

Then, he and Mr. Williams rang the New Freedom Bell seven times, tolling it “high and loud” in the city to which it was dedicated on this summer’s evening.

After viewing the parade, which featured a great percentage of NSA groups, Frank Conforti of the Philadelphia Police Department remarked, “It’s great to see young people with a clear look in their eyes. If all the youth of America could have the glow that these kids have, we’d have no problems in this country.”

Added William Marrazzo, city commissioner for the Water Department: “I’m overwhelmed by the obvious spirit of NSA, which conveyed the connection between very positive values and putting them into action. I'm particularly glad that my children were here to see this.”

dependence Hall’s chan-
elier, enlarged tens of times, hung from the rafters, courtesy of the NSA stage crew. The stage itself was a huge replica of the chair used by George Washington when he presided over the Constitutional Convention, again a product of the stage crew. Around the circumference of the building hung window frames; through these peered the faces of the Founding Fathers, along with that of Soka Gakkai International President Daisaku Ikeda. The delegates, were all dressed as colonial patriots. Indeed, the scene was set for a resounding affirmation of the principles which set America free, and which now can be extended and refined to the point of securing life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all humanity. 

Both Mayor Goode and Congressman Foglietta showed up in business suits, in contrast to the costumes of the members. Once the New Freedom Bell rang to commence the proceedings, however, the two dignitaries were swept up in the tide of events. Congressman Foglietta, along with Mayor Goode had viewed the NSA cultural presentation preceding the General Meeting remarked, “Never have I seen even dedication like the enthusiasm that you have brought to the City of Philadelphia today.” Mayor Goode, continuing his thoughts yesterday, said, "I believe you [NSA] are an inspiration to all Americans.”
