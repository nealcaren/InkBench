over births and sorrowing over funerals. As he has already
went over the coffins of 100 children and we know not how many 
grandchildren, he at least is experienced in affliction.

We stopped at a nice public shop, the best of the kind 
I’ve found in Java, and I bought some photos and postals of 
Javanese. See postals No. 26 to 31, and photos large, No. 
31,32 & 33, small No. 34 to 48. After lunch we rested and I 
read up about some more temples we are to see to-morrow. At 
5:30 we were rigged up in our best and in a grand “milord” as the
big carriages are called and going to see the Prince, for the 
Sultan has a sort of guard called a Prince, not so high as the 
Sultan, but a royalty. We had a letter to him fr. Laberton 
to see to-morrow. He is a little interested in Theology. He 
lives in a fine palace with an immense marble floored verandah
there we were received by the Prince, his uncle, four brothers 
and four sisters. He is a young man and is the “boss” of his
house. He is liberal, but he would not condone that his sisters 
could go out in civilly with matchmakers. We received warm 
welcome and coffee with lunch. The refreshments were brought 
in by young girls, they had beautiful array. Generally in 
Java, the people are very respectful towards Europeans

(sort of theatre which consists of pantomime done to the 
recital of the old Mahommah or poems of the Hindoo. 
When pantomime is acted by men it is Majang Orang, See 
postal No. 41. When the people put on masks for the part it 
is Wayang Wong, See postal 42. It is also done with 
dolls, the dolls are, very fine also, the scenes done with 
them behind a curtain.

I must return to the Sultan’s Palace to record that under a 
small shed was a large grandfather clock, and above a neighboring 
shed was a Chinese bell, its rope leading into the small shed. 
Two men were watching day and night by the side of the clock, and
every hour they rang the bell. Thus the centuries old custom 
of ringing the bell is continued, but it is done with scientific 
accuracy.

The most astute thing I have heard of in connection with 
Colonial affairs was done by the Dutch, here, nor is it a bit 
more unprincipled than a thousand other instances of the way the 
Europeans got the upper hand in Asiatic countries. There was here 
a somewhat powerful kingdom – the real heart of Java were so. 
The kingdom is exposed to have been found by thieffinds, be 
long ago no one can muse the date, and called Hlaterm, Dutch 
means upper. A Sultan tried it, and it was listed the wordened 
damp is a very thin skin covering sore ants. Atwell is to 
monopolize the bell, in which, & in connection with the amount of 
damage by the help, to build a road to the interior, to open 
up country to Dutch cultivation. The practice is so enormous 
that it threatens to swamp is to. It has the effect, of courses, 
of crippling native industry, and of leading to general, impoverishment. 
It is said that the other States are being treated in a similar way. 

I believe I have given you a pretty fair idea of our sojourn in 
Samarang. I am anxious to hear from you all, and to know how 
every one is getting on.
