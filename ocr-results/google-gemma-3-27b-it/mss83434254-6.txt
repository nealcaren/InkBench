We must remember, too, the times in which Lincoln wrought.” Professor Arthur E. Sutherland remarks: “Our constitutionalism is partly
a system of morals. And moral growth is a slow process.” He adds that
“therefore, to recall that the Lincoln of 100 years ago was a man of
good will striving to loose the bonds of oppression from an enslaved
people, but working within the social and political milieu of his time
and within the bounds of existing constitutional limitations as he and
his contemporaries viewed them. 

This is not to say that Lincoln did not grow with responsibility in
power. On the contrary he himself put the matter exactly right when in
his second annual message he said: “The dogmas of the quiet past are
inadequate to the stormy present . . . as our case is new, so we must
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we
shall save our country.” He did, in fact, disengage himself from pre-
possessions. And if his growth seems to have been by slow stages they
represent those normal interstitial changes which any dissection of the
anatomy of greatness would disclose.

To “save our country” became Lincoln’s magnificent obsession.
Herndon has said of him that “his ambition was a little engine which
knew no rest.” When he achieved the Presidency it was his mind and
heart which knew no rest in the effort to save the Union. From the
summit he saw two distinct problems: the preservation of the Union
and the abolition of slavery. He believed that the two could be kept
separate and that he could save the Union without emancipating the
slaves at once. The distinguished author of “The American Political
Tradition” says that Lincoln’s attitude “arose in part from a sound sense
for the pace of historical change. He knew that formal freedom for the
Negro, coming suddenly and without preparation, would not be real
freedom, and in this respect he understood the slavery question better
than most of the Radicals.” But he adds, significantly, “they had under-
stood better than he the revolutionary dynamics of the war.” 

Thus, between his First Inaugural Address, instinct with moderation, 
and his Second, when he agreed that “this interest [slavery] was some-
how the cause of the war” and suggested, even, that it was a providential
scourge for the wrongs of slavery, Lincoln’s policy — and he himself — 
had to undergo radical change. Originally, regarding his rightful role to
be that of moderator of extremes in public sentiment, he moved from
one expedient to another. He had advocated the statesmanlike operation
of the Southern states to acquire a complete knowledge of their plight 
for the establishment of a more just basis for a perpetual peace. While
he saw colonization as a possible solution to the racial problem, he never
advocated it zealously. But the logic of events, and the growing sense of
moral imperativeness, impelled him forward.
