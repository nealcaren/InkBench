any more, so if I should go to Marseilles, Aida Wilson must go
with me and would have to hurry back.

This year I went to Washington, as usual, but I came
down with a cold and was in bed most of the time that I stayed there.
I was there only long enough to get decidedly colder. My cold
has now come easy and I am feeling fairly well, with the exception
of my feet and legs, but, dear Ross, I can no longer make speeches.

I hope you will soon be all right again. We shall be
meeting again some of these days. 

Lovingly,

February 24, 1933.

Miss Rose Manus,
Herengracht 67, 
Amsterdam-Zuid,
Holland.

My dear Rose:

I have done a great deal of thinking about Marseilles.
Mrs. Ashby said that if I ever intended to cross the ocean
again, this was the time to do it. As a matter of fact, I 
had about made up my mind never to cross that ocean again,
yet, after reading her letter, I thought hard upon that 
subject. I finally concluded there really was no par-
ticular help that I could give. 

I am not so familiar with the Alliance now. I do
not know the women who are the workers. My generation, like
Annie Parmeter, are saying good-bye to you, who are younger,
are putting our tasks on younger shoulders.

The great question is what to do with the Alliance.
If I could go over with a pocket full of money for you all, 
I think you would be glad to see me, but, alas, money is scarce,
is poor here at present. Everybody has lost money and income,
and taxes have gone up enormously and yet they do not 
bring in much, because people have so little that can be 
taken. The depression did not reach us until after it had
made much trouble for Europe. Now we are getting it â€œfull
blown." It is amazing what has happened since the War. It 
is an equal situation here and so little effect upon the Il-
lusionists. 

At present, I can see no prospect in any direction 
of receiving money hard to get from the outside. The organisations
are all struggling hard down to their own bare budgets
which have been much cut. 

Cornelia asked me to send her many greetings, she
furnished the major quantity of the linens for the house
which you came to see in Brussels. The recent illness has
made her quite frail and she is unable to leave her home. 

Faithfully yours, 

Carrie Chapman Catt. 
P.S.  President Roosevelt is inaugurating himself next 
month. I hope he may be able to do something for the coun-
try.
