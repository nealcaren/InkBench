and the best six months of my life on account of the larger opportunities
for the friendly and continued service to our people. Speaking of the Harmony

produce food for the armies in Europe.  For these reasons I was compelled to
resign my position with the Harmony Society April 1, 1918 and accepted a
position with the War Camp Community Service.
