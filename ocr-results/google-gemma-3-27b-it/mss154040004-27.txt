Uitenhage and Benoni. We “did” Bulawayo while passing through
and visited Victoria Falls for pleasure. This makes 13 towns
visited, including the capitals of the four provinces composing
the Union of S. A. and two places in Rhodesia. I conducted the 
entire correspondence arranging for the trip, engaging hotels, etc.
and wrote many letters concerning the convention held in Durban.
Several towns invited us to visit them and these invitations I 
had to decline. I think this part of the work was more arduous
than any of the party comprehended. The statistics which follow
apply to myself alone, as the program followed was not quite
the same for any other member of us. 
I made 13 public speeches, each exceeding one hour. I made
22 additional speeches, none shorter than 10 minutes and several
varying from 40 minutes to one hour –– total 65 speeches.
There were seven receptions; 18 luncheons, 3 being given
by Mayors of towns. About two and half days at full dinners were spent
in expressing which included four full Victoria and 11 nights 
in another town. 12 committee meetings. 
Of the 78 days, 12 laid waste and 14 were spent in 
actual town meetings. The last dozen or 14 towns gave us a full
and hearty welcome. The day’s doings I cannot amend.

in the evening. The 36 days spent in sightseeing and travel
left 40 days spent with suffragists. The functions including
public meetings number 76, making an average of nearly two 
things each day. We made many visits to railroad stations, Cooks,
etc., visited many shops in search of postals and photos, did some 
shopping, and incidentally visited many places of interest which
could be put in when there was time to spare. These last men-
tioned incidentals included visits to eight museums, all of which
we found extremely interesting and instructive. 
The above record was performed in a climate varying from 
cold which required loading ourselves with all the clothes
possible, and sleeping with hot water bottles, bed shoes and flan-
nel nightgowns, to tropical heat rendered endurable only by the
continual whir of electric fans. 
I should add to the above record three and a half days spent 
with the convention in Durban. 
Now, passing up the East Coast, we visited 7 additional
towns belonging to that Africa. 
This record would not be complete without listing the read-
ing done in connection with it and which was the part of the work
that is most unsatisfactory. The condition of the women’s paper 
(Since later South African) I have read the following, I ran from 
the first to the last line. “Directory and Year Book.”
