But you can only win through rebellion. The times call for the fighting 
spirit of the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence. You have 
influence whenever you are ready to fight for it. Then that time comes, 
you women will not fight alone. There will be plenty of splendid, big-
souled American men to fight by your side. Do not forget that there are many 
men who bore the humiliation of being so-called rubber stamps before you 
were enfranchised. [* * Here is some here-inhere that the

“It’s great to be out where the fight is strong

To be where the heartiest troops belong 
And to fight there for man and God.”

Six years; six years to observe the infirmities of American politics, 
you have had, women of America. Will you allow any power whatsoever to steal 
from you the significance of the vote you struggled so long to win? My 
suggestion is probably impractical. The only thing certainly right about 
it is the proposal of rebellion. No wrong was ever righted by obedience 
to those who have sponsored that wrong. Wrong was ever righted by rebellion 
against those who stand for that wrong. Think it over, pray, think again… 
Keep on thinking. You will find a way. When you have it, arise, put aside 
your ease, your soft indulgences. There is work for you. The primaries 
need reforming, the parties need renovating and all politics need disinfecting. 
Is it true that you women have no influence as regulars, as standpatters? 
Then try the path of rebellion and blaze a new trail to decency and honor 
for your party and your nation. You can have influence if you will. Yes, 
a hundred fold more influence than the Pennsylvania statesman has now.
