And then wretched men with hands 
Did pray back golden woe,
And with my heart I knew them on
To see my precious Lord.

Again I stood beside the gate
May heart and glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed thing
He Lord had given me.

Growing old.
The prison house in which I have
dwelling is fray
But God removes my defects ereght
Within—Make a lily of days.

For me a dimmest slowly crept
Arrow death & paint—light—
But heaven offered closer to my view
And nearer to my sight.
