**(c) PREAMBLE.**

“WHEREAS, unconditional slavery exists to a fearful extent amongst us as a nation, in violation of those principles that vowed movers to the dreadful struggle of the Revolution—
“that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;”

WHEREAS, the aristocracy of the South are determined to perpetuate it by means scarcely less dreadful than the tortures of the Inquisition, and the bastard aristocracy of the north are aiding their “chivalrous” compeers of the South in their inhuman endeavors by misrepresenting, flattering, threatening, and imprisoning those who dare expose the evil of a universal freedom, and further, by circulating publications and making speeches so higly incendiary as to excite mobs, and impel them to their ruthless work of terror and destruction;

WHEREAS, the crisis has arrived at which the descendants of the patriots must determine whether they will establish the claim of a cowardly precedent of surrendering their most sacred rights at the nod of an arrogant, domineering and self-constituted aristocracy, or in the spirit of their fathers manfully maintain them—

AND WHEREAS, it will be manifestly impossible to effectively surrender those rights, and with them the hopes of the free, till the prediction of Jefferson shall be realized, and the slave fearless and alive shall fill the land or hisratation shall enrich the blood of his master—

THEREFORE, RESOLVED, under a deep sense of duty to ourselves, to the slave, to our country, and to God, that we sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, we will exercise the full right of discussing the subject of slavery, that we will use all constitutional and peaceful means for its speedy termination—and to act the more efficiently, form ourselves into a society and adopt the following, &c.

**(d) ABOLITION.**

*From the Cincinnati Gazette.*

Some forty miles from Cincinnati, on the East, are two settlements of free negroes—probably near a thousand—men, women, and children, of the African color, with a very little mixture of the mahogany or lighter shades. The negroes own the land occupied by them, but without the poll tax. Each family has a small clearing; they construct comfortable houses, their lands are purchased expressly for them, and parceled out among them about fifteen years ago. 

These lands are not of the best quality of Ohio land; but, by good management and continued labor, they are made to yield a respectable subsistence. 

The settlements are mostly located within a few miles of the Ohio canal. The inhabitants appear to be generally temperate and industrious. They have two schoolhouses, and several teachers among them. They have also two churches. 

Several respectable white men are identified with the cause of the colonization of these people, and they say, that the success of the settlements is a complete answer to all objections to the policy of expatriation. 

A strong-built log house, with a floor of rough boards, and nearly all arrangements for comfort, is certainly far preferable to the hutches in which our slaves are huddled together—and a life of liberty is worth more than sovereignty.

—But still, we are not satisfied such settlements are appropriate for the free people of color of the United States. They are not Americans; they never will be; and the settlements attempt to make them something they never can be—a distinct and independent people. 

We do not believe that the experiment will ultimately succeed. The whites will not settle among them; the colored people will not assimilate with the whites; and the settlements will remain, as they are now, detached communities—a perpetual by-word and reproach. 

They ought to be permitted to live in the States, and enjoy all their rights as citizens. 

The Legislature of Ohio has passed a law to prevent the immigration of free people of color into that State. We do not know what other States have done.
