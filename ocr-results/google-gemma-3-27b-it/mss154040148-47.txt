My dear Mollie:-

I gave you the peace of a
cable and now it is here. He remains
another day but I suspect that progress
is in the direction of recovery and that you
won't be cabled at all. 

Moh 27 - I was interrupted and now send
all things any difference and write as soon as
your cable has been received. Passing through
that discouraging stage, when you think you
never will be well again and when life has
lost all its flavor. But keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. I am so glad
you are better. The world needs me a
good old place. Much good you do Mollie.

I expected to mail you a note here
because Otto got up to have a good 
cable post & I could be a good mail 
station, but it seems many American
