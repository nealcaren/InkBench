My dear Steady: I thank you for two letters and the moles and clippings concerning Mrs. Blinn. I thank you especially for the clipping, as you suspect, I am interested in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the National Convention I think, Mrs. Smithe brought a letter she had received from Effie Vance, and she had described very vividly how Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her suffering, her Christian fortitude. Tears flowed as she read it, as she was no great admirer of Mr. B. Dulein, she told me that Effie Vance was also getting into established in Ch. Sci. Mrs. B. was one of the most generous and forgiving natures even, and alas she also had her moments of sorrow, as well as the rest of us, she was a woman to be admired for very many estimable qualities.
