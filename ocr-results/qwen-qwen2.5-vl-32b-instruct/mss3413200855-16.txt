I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not
send my check to the Cambridge
league for the National League.
I am enclosing a check for **50.00**, if
you have already paid, will you
destroy this check. My old check book
was in Cambridge so I cannot
look it up.

I hope Mass. has been getting some rain, enough to keep down the forest fires, but not been deluged as we have been.

---

It has rained almost incessantly since early May, from the first to nineteenth of June we had fifteen days of rain.  We'll probably be back by the middle of July, and will phone to learn the amount of the Very cordially,
fund.
