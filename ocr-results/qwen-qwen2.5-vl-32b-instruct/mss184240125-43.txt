I came to Boston in Nov. to make a short visit before winter, and I am still here, now waiting for winter to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only been to the opera a few times. I have seen none of the celebrities, they were too costly. My heart is not broken; I am not broken easily. I thought I should see you here this spring, because the Peppers said so. It has been a trying winter, but spring and violets are near. Aggie writes me often, and is happy if her bit of housework will carry itself. But if she is shut in, she so hates in-door "idleness" that she frets, the harness creaks. She has a good, practical man, a keeper from doing unkind acts of whims. It is not easy. God bless you dearâ€”always.

Lovingly,
