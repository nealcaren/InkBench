**Editor Woman's Journal,**

**Dear Madam,**

Enclosed you will  
find $2.50, which I send to  
pay for the Woman's Journal, to  
be sent to my address, for one  
year. I have hitherto received  
the paper through a friend, but  
I think I will have one of my  
own now, so that I can have  
some to give away.

I received your letter last  
Monday, and I wish to thank  
you for your evidently careful  
perusal of my manuscript, and  
for your friendly criticism of  
my work. I feel more encouraged  
by your commendations.

### Notes:
- The header appears in a different, cursive font style, separate from the main body text.
- There are slight variations in lettering typical of handwritten notes but all words are legible and transcribed as written.
- The amount is written as "$2.50" consistently throughout.
