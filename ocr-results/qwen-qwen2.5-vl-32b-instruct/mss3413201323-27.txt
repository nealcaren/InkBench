**THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.**  
Some Iowa newspapers carry the erroneous impression that the special law enforcement agents are appointed by the attorney general. These special officers are named by the governor. If Iowa should elect a "liberal" governor he probably would have "liberal" special agents—Sioux City Tribune.

**MR. IRISH GROWING OLD.**  
Nothing is sadder in this world than the change that comes over so many men as they shift from the buoyant enthusiasms of youth to the view-with-alarm despondency of age. We do not know of an illustration more to the point than the speeches John P. Irish is now making in Iowa against woman suffrage when contrasted with the speeches he made in the Iowa legislature for woman suffrage. John P. Irish was a forward-looking man in the old days when with spontaneous eloquence he pleaded for equal rights. Now he is as solemnly alarmed as any other pessimist. It is really too bad that so many estimable people begin to see every——

**Column 2:**

**in the first line that he is “an American citizen,” in the next eulogizes England, and in the last subscribes himself in lieu of his name, “A Gladstonian Liberal.” Evidently he used this expression to conceal his German ancestry. What would we think of the state of his hyphen had he signed himself “A Follower of Bismarck?”**

**Third in the column is a letter entitled “Mawkish America.” Its author declares that this country is “hysterically feminine and neurotic,” and he signs himself “Anglicus.” His hyphen is evidently severely inflamed.**

**Immediately following is the critical judgment of Mr. James McDonald, who says: “I consider the British empire the freest and best government in the world.” Well, why not go home, then?**

**The column winds up with an article on the “mongrel population” of the United States, ending:**

**“Bah! My country, ’tis of thee.  
“James Macpherson,  
“Trenton, N. J.”**

**Just suppose that name had been Wilhelm Lustenschreck!**

**All of these letters appeared in one column of the New York Tribune, and they appeared there consecutively. Not one has been omitted. Shall we continue to think of the hyphen solely in Teutonic terms?**

**A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.**  
The Register recently asked of the Chicago Tribune “why did not Washington and Madison and Jefferson and Hamilton and the constitution makers meet the situation and give this country an army and a navy at the start?” The Tribune comes back with the claim that these men would have given us a military establishment but a blind congress would not listen to them. The Tribune quotes a number of familiar passages from Washington, and then jumps to the conclusion that our school histories ought to be rewritten to show the military purposes of the fathers.**

**It is not worth while to quibble with the Tribune, but it is worth while to get at the real point of view of the men who started this nation out, in a military age, without a military fitting, in the belief that a great, peaceful, industrial democracy could be built in this new land free from the follies and blunders that had wrecked every earlier attempt at human organization.**

**The Register will not go to the school histories, but will go to Alexander Hamilton, because of all the men who leaned most to**

**adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. This will not lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms.”**

**In the legislative session of 1870 an amendment proposing woman suffrage in both houses of the Iowa legislature, and passed the house in the session of 1872. It was defeated in the senate of 1872 and so the amendment was not submitted to popular vote. John P. Irish engineered the amendment through the house both in 1870 and 1872. John A. Kasson was member from Polk and he voted for the amendment at both sessions.**

**The constitution was accepted on this presentation by Mr. Maling and published in Iowa papers, to the effect that woman suffrage in Colorado was a failure and should be abandoned,” said Senator Shafroth. “These statements are not substantiated by the facts, and while I would not dignify them by calling attention to his specific indictments, I wish to state that in my judgment the experience of twenty-three years of equal suffrage in the state of Colorado has conclusively demonstrated its rights.**

**Immediately following is the military defense of the new nation, and every man was protected in the private right to bear arms in order that at no later date might a mistaken congress order or maintain a regular army to overturn our popular liberties.**

**Women in Colorado.**  
Washington Bureau of The Des Moines Register: In an interview Senator John F. Shafroth of Colorado vigorously champions the cause of equal suffrage and specifically defends woman suffrage in his own state against charges recently made by J. B. Maling of Denver that equal suffrage had proved a failure in Colorado.**

**John P. Irish was a forward-looking man in the old days when, with spontaneous eloquence, he pleaded for equal rights. Now he is as solemnly alarmed as any other pessimist.**

**When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage**
**WOMEN IN COLORADO.**  
Washington Bureau of The Des Moines Register: In an interview Senator John F. Shafroth of Colorado vigorously champions the cause of equal suffrage in his own state against charges recently made by J. B. Maling of Denver that equal suffrage had proved a failure in Colorado.**

**In the legislative session of 1870 an amendment proposing woman suffrage was passed by both houses of the Iowa legislature, and passed the house in the session of 1872. It was defeated in the senate of 1872 and so the amendment was not submitted to popular vote. John P. Irish engineered the amendment through the house both in 1870 and 1872. John A.

**The experiment was far-reaching and read as follows:**

**Laws of Iowa, 1870: 252. Joint Resolution No. 14. Joint resolution proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa, and to provide for its reference and publication.**

**Be it resolved by the general assembly of the state of Iowa, That the following amendments to the constitution of the state of Iowa, be and are hereby proposed:**

**1. Strike from section 1 of article II of said constitution, the word “male.”**

**2. Strike from section 4 of article III of said constitution, the word “male.”**

**Resolved further, That these resolutions proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa are hereby referred to the legislature to be chosen at the next general election, and that the secretary of state shall cause the same to be published for three months previous to the time of the next general election of members of the legislature in one newspaper in each congressional district.**

**Approved April 4, 1870.**

**WHAT MR. IRISH SAID.**  
Legislative supplement, session of 1870, March 29, 1870: Mr. Irish—It is to be expected that I, as the member who introduced this resolution, out of which the joint resolution is moved, should say something on the question before the house. Let us view it, if you choose, in the light of an experiment at whose inception we stand today. Let us leave the poetry of the proposition out of the question, for the poetry of the proposition has been given in its most eloquent manner by the gentleman from Scott (Mr. Green). Let us view it in the light of fact; look at it in its prosiest shape and see if there is any actual strength in the proposition. Gentlemen who may object to the passage of this joint resolution cannot object thereto because it has not been demanded by the class proposed to be affected by it. The best and the most talented women of our land—those who during the late war showed their love of country by works which were not less laborious than those performed by the soldier in the field—woman which she has always commanded—It has not lowered the ideals of women nor changed her refined, womanly qualities.**

**Nor was this a sentiment confined to the colonies and the young republic. Ambroise Clement writing in Lalor’s “Encyclopedia of Political Science” says, “A very able German author, Mr. Rotteck, published in 1816 an important work entitled ‘Standing Armies and National Militia.’ He proves from the history of all wars, from those of the most ancient peoples down to the termination of the war of 1815, that standing armies or paid troops under the sole command of their officers are not the best bulwarks of the state.”**

**In doing that we are obeying the spirit of the scripture. I care not what might have been said by Paul or any other apostle, who was so unfortunate as to live and die a bachelor. It is better to refer to the writings of the divine master and not to the teachings of one who was a little bit headstrong and pedantic in his views and manner of expression. The gentleman from Dubuque (Mr. O'Donnell) has ably spoken on the other side of the question and has shown that the majority of the men of the world are in favor of the admission of women into the franchise. I do not know what sort they were. They may have been utterly disqualified to speak in public, and it might have been proper that Paul should exhort them to keep silence in the polls or legislature.**
