### TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double  
**By ELEANOR ROBERTS**  
There are so many guest-shot "swaps" on television next season that viewers will think they're seeing double. Searching back in your memory, you'll be saying, "Now, WHERE did I see Bing Crosby—on the Bob Hope show or on his own special?"

**SINATRA SWAPPING SHOTS WITH MARTIN**  
Frankie Sinatra is swapping guest shots with Dean Martin, who, in turn, will return the courtesy on the Sinatra special. And Milton Berle is not only involved with Danny Thomas, who’ll make a return appearance on Uncle Miltie’s special but he’s doing a swap with Lucy-Desi, too.

None of this involves the exchange of cold, hard cash which makes these top-bracketed, high-priced stars very happy since the tax boys can't take a slice off these reciprocal "visits," we hear.

**ALL-STAR FOOTBALL TOPS TONIGHT**  
By DICK KLEINER  
BEST BET—Smack in the middle of August, we've got ourselves the first football game of the season tonight. This is the annual kick-off of the kick-off season, THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME from Chicago's Soldier Field. Each year, the cream of last season's graduating collegians meet the pros without Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood.

**Pick Of The Weekend**  
7:30-8:30 (Ch. 7) — **Johnny Staccato's** *RADWIDE* retracts its steps back to the spot on the trail where everybody started, dropping from poisoned food. Seems a pack of high IQ rustlers dosed the vittles with powdered coyote weed, a lethal seasoning. The object of their black game was to kill off the whole crew so they could swipe the cattle. They reckon

**TONIGHT**  
***TONIGHT***  
9-9:30 (Ch. 7) — The plot for tonight's PHIL SILVERS SHOW repeat has an "Annie Get Your Gun" flavor. There's a sharp-shooting contest and, after one thing and another, Bilko stakes his healthy wad on a WAC who promptly falls in love—and you can’t get a man with a gun. Peggy Cass has a ball as the deadeye dame.

9:30-10 (Ch. 7) — STRIPE PLAYHOUSE is repeating a Schlitz Playhouse original which is a solid detective story. It’s a tricky murder tale called “No Answer,” with Keenan Wynn the super-sleuth and Donald Cook the prime suspect. He seems to

**Pick Of The Weekend**  
9:30 — THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME (See Best Bet).

**Saturday**  
BEST BET — The PERRY PRESENTS gimmick — the alibi manac—is gradually being eased out of the show. And, more and more, the singers simply do good songs without any attempt to tie them in to events of the past. Tonight, Tony Bennett sings "Strike Up the Band" and Jaye P. Morgan does "Music, Maestro, Please" in that uncon- nected way. And there’s a medley of some all-time record hits which has no almanac signifi- cance. During this spot, Tony will sing “Cry,” Jaye P. does “Daddy,” The Modernaires have “That’s My Desire” and there’ll be a dancing production number to “One O’Clock Jump.”

7:30-8 (Ch. 5)—If your seismogra- phic mind is registering some tremors on the West Coast, it’s probably because THE DICK CLARK SHOW is getting ready to do three shows there. Before they left New York, they taped the one you’ll see tonight. Jack Scott is the biggest name, with Tommy Edwards, Rusty York, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Browns the other guests.

8-9 PERRY PRESENTS (See best bet).  
9-9:30 (Ch. 7)—BRENNER continues to find new approaches for a police show. Tonight’s tells of a social worker and a police- man, who have differing atti- tudes about juvenile crime. Since Lee Grant is the social worker and Edward Binns is the police- man, both these views are be- lievable and well-presented. Binns and Miss Grant, who have worked together before, make a good team.

10:30-11 (Ch. 5)—THE D.A.’S MAN is repeating one of its better jobs, in which you’ll meet a real nasty type. This is a ...
