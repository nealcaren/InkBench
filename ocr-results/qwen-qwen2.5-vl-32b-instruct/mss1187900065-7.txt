And wretched men with ropes
Cleaved each golden wood.
And with my heart I knelt - the morn
To see my gracious Lord.
Again, I stood beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed thing
The Lord had given me.

F. E. M. Harper

Growing old.
The palmy hands in which I live
Is failing to decay.
But God renews my spirit's strength
Within - Make walls of clay.

For me a dimness slowly creeps
Around Earth's fading light â€“
But heavenly forms clearer to view
And nearer to my sight.
