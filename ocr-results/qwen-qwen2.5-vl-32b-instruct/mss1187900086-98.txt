Dear Frederick Douglass,  
When we first saw your appointment to Hoyt—well also how many kind and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you I began to clip and stick them with the intention of sending them all on to you – but alas! all the huge files of editorial scraps you have all disappeared but those.

It was pleasant to see the appreciation which you are outside.  
While I am alive to see it.  
I am not sure I was ever glad  
To know you Ed. We need you here.
