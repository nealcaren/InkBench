**Bridport, Dorsetshire  
October 9th, 1866**

My dear Mr. Douglas,

I hope our retreat  
from our three month's tour  
through France, Italy, and  
Switzerland. We spent a few days at  
Woodcote, Wootton-under-Edge, before reaching  
Bridport, and there we found your  
letters, which greatly  
please. We found one of your  
wife along  
with a  
[illegible]. She replied  
 đầy mostly full of joy and content.

I trust you will have more  
such adventures as those described in your letter, recounting the scene  
as having taken place in Baltimore last winter. It was a mercy that you  
were so  
uninjured, but you might not  
be so  
fortunate another  
time, so will be prudent as to  
where you travel, and September how will you console yourself knowing it.
