**Port of Spain, March 26, 1923**

My dear Mollie:  
I got your message for a cable and now is here.  
Remained all day but suspect that progress is  
in the direction you want and that you have not cabled at all.  
March 27, I was unmindful here and now being told things are different and time has passed, that  
your cable has been received, and it was such  
a relief to get it. Imagine you passing through that  
absorbing stage when you think you have never met so well again and when life has lost all its  
perversity. Hal, keep up your courage and you'll pull through. I am so glad you are better.  
This world would be a blacker place without you, dear Mollie.  
Expected many thingsot it was a good  
cable receipt. It would be a good mail  
station, but it seems many Americans
