My dear Mrs Dickinson  
Yours of the 19th containing a sketch for our inductions came duly & safely and I acknowledge its receipt at once. How it amongst found both Jane & myself. It will be done even on little wing.  Yes it must continue to say it all until I write.

My dear Mrs. Simms,  
For your favour –  
Jane said this was mine to give you.  

Yrs sd Maria White
