quite anyone to see both. That is
one of the greatest difficulties about
This place. I am unable to keep up
with current events unless the pa-
pers are sent from home, and I
miss reading the daily papers very
much.

Hoping that I have not put your
eyes to a very severe test, and that
you will favor me with an early
reply, I will close, with much love
I am,
Your affectionate grand-daughter,
Hattie.
