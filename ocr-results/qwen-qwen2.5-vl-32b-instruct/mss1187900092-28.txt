Oct. 12th, 1900**

Dear Grandpa:â€”  
I have learned with  
much surprise, that you are still  
in the city of Washington enjoying  
an extended leave of absence from  
your post of duty, I am very glad  
that such a leave has been granted  
you, as I know that you are far  
happier on Cedar Hill than any  
place you can go and I only wish  
that matters could be arranged to  
allow you to remain in this.
