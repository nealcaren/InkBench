But it really seems that  
I am never - never to have  
what I wish for.  
Everything seems against  
me. - I wonder if 'home'  
is us [[annotated: unreally distant]]  
to suffer. Perhaps it is  
the daily means of  
softening the heart, -  
and a teaching us true  
sympathy; oh!  
it is better to be afflicted,  
for, if it is tempered, to be  
indifferent to the former,  
what it is to be saddened  
by those - upon whose  
fortune ever smiles -  
draws hard, heartless thy  
are. Their callowts is long  
to bear - than the former, what  
tears the heart -
