carrely to be a joy to you.  You know how happy it would make me – it is – you are all the affection and sympathy of when you are here. In a few days – that is all up to Switzerland – but poor for a month or two I think.  I shall then – say about five weeks. I must he back in England on the 23rd of August. My poor old sister will be then on her way back to her home I presume.  I have worked very hard during the last few months – really without relief or grace though.  Duty has been my motto.  Thus when I can return home within a few years it will not take long – all my dearest life is there – at Violet's home.  All those people and relations who have done so much for my happiness are – it is my duty to go to them. 昳 All who would not say so in our own home if I brought gases around it.
