Charlotte writes that she  
received an invitation from  
Mrs. James (Maria Richardson),  
to attend an Alumnae gath-  
ering in Washington, before  
which Stephen Foster's daughter  
Allen, had been invited to  
read a paper. Charlotte  
listened to her address with  
absorbing interest for her parents'  
sake as well as for her own,  
and said it was an effusive  
description of the govern-  
ment of all the Colleges  
that are worthy of the name  
-- forty-eight in twenty-one States.  
Miss Foster is a teacher in the  
Girls' High School in Boston  
where my cousin, Cis [Clementine],  
the one who died, (spoken of  
above), also teaches.
