**W**ANTED, feminism in politics. Emily Newell Blair says so. Mrs. Blair, sunny-tempered, broad-visioned and one time hopeful, confesses herself (in her recent *Journal* articles) to be pessimistic and discouraged about women in politics. Her conclusions are drawn from seven years' experience and hard work as vice-chairman of the National Democratic Committee.

She admits that women vote, sit in conventions and serve on committees, but instead of supporting independently their own ideas and policies, she charges that they have been widely guilty of merely doing what men want them to do and of voting as men direct them. Mrs. Blair finds that women have created no progressive action for their parties and that women form no bloc of political power.

Perhaps. But there is a twin comment and one should not be made without the other. The masses of men, also, fail to support independently their own ideas and policies and they walk up the chalk line to vote exactly as their higher-ups tell them to; in fact, men and women behave so much alike in politics that the comment should be confined to the admission that the great masses of men and women have not really grown up yet and are more or less in leading strings.

Mrs. Blair suggests that the remedy is the application of more feminism. I believe this is the comment of the other party also. Mrs. Blair says there are two ways only in which women may become a power in politics and such power she regards as essential. One is by holding office and the other is by becoming effective in political organization. Either or both calls for more feminism.  

But is the feminism a revival of something we once had or is it a brand-new attitude for which modern politics is yearning? Personally, while I agree with Mrs. Blair in many of her comments, I do not think her diagnosis is correct.  

**T** here fact is that when the new women voters walked through the opened door into American politics there was one great crying need throughout the nation and that was for a thorough party cleaning. The parties have not been cleaned yet and, apparently, are as much in need of it as on the day women were enfranchised.  

Said Professor McMaster, of the University of Pennsylvania, under the title, *The Political Depravity of the Fathers*:  
“A very little study of long forgotten politics will suffice to show that in filibustering and gerrymandering, in stealing governorships and legislatures, in using force at the polls, in colonizing and
