Shannon had a most advantageous situation offered him in Russia.  It was in the First Grammar School of the Fourth Class, which had been offered him.  He accepted it.  S.S. much concealed, though it was a Sympathy for his role.  His work a match for it.  Eventually it refused him.  Though it was a very good thing for him.  Again and again I was reminded a Telegram from Petersburg was sent to me to accept the situation.   I was glad to be able to return to Central College where I was engaged as an Unglitt [unclear] Johnson.  I would have been much before I should have been death to him.
