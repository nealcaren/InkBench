My dear Mr. Blackwell  

Thank you very much indeed for your  
most kind permission to me to set some of the verses  
of your translation of "La Paluera" to music.  
I found the translation so appealing and beautiful  
that music to it would float into my head, and last  
I was tempted to make a very simple little song out  
of three or four of the verses, just for our private use.  
Then, as our friends seemed to like it, my sister-in-law  
offered to write to you, in case it might be published.  
I should most certainly give myself the great pleasure
