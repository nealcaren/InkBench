My dear Douglass:

On my passage thro’ New York yesterday from Phila. where I spoke on Friday evening, I called at Rumford Clo’s office for news about the sailing of our steamer. And this is what the clerks in the office assured me:

The steamer is the "Orange Nassau." She will sail from Pierrepont Stores (along side of the Wall Street ferry), Brooklyn, on Friday next, 4th instant, at noon, for Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on this information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the "Orange Nassau" is the poorest steamer of the line. But she is staunch and sound and just we can stand it for six days on board.
