**Note:** The handwriting in the image is somewhat difficult to decipher. The text within the lines appears to be "F I B H U A Y, 1865." and "G L A H H I N Y N  &  S J Y J N H A Y E." These could potentially be stylized or cryptographic variations. The transcription follows the principle of transcribing exactly as written, including any unusual characters or formatting.
