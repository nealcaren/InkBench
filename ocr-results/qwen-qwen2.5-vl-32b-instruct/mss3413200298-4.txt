Dear Mrs. Brown:  

I can't let your note about  
Miss Blackwell go unanswered, even  
if the chagrin I seemed like to send  
must be omitted.  

I have always admired Miss Blackwell,  
and, in later years, have loved her  
especially. Her always beautiful Christ-  
mas and Easter masses, and her  
indomitable spiritual grace are such  
wonderful additions to the great back-  
ground of her life work.  

It wrings my heart to know that  
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.  
There are so many who are; I am one  
of them myself, or, of course, I would  
share in making the fund which you  
are raising. Being a starving artist  
is a most painful handicap,  
in every way, but it is particularly  
hard to endure, when appeals like  
this come.  

Thank you for including me  
as one of her friends, - which  
I most heartily am.  

Sincerely,  
Mary Ware Dennett
