Republican National Committee,  
No. 241 Fifth Avenue,  
New York, Aug. 19th, 1880.**

Dear Sir:

I send you by mail to-day the  
advance sheets of an article by Mr. Jay  
which is to be published in the International Review on the 23rd. Thinking it  
may interest you I take the liberty of  
sending you this copy, but not, if you please, to be made public before that  
date.  

Yours truly,  
**Marshall Jewell**
