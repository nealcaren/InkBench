We have not lost many men yet, 1 killed and 15 wounded, is all of the regt. There is another fort 6 miles above here called FORT BLAKEY, that is invested by steel, with 15,000 negro troops. The Rebels have a perfect hatred to them, therefore they came out last nite and made three different charges on to our negroes. They repulsed them each time. Our regiment is the closest of any regiment on the line. Our rifle pits are within 15 rods of the Rebel works. We are now digging to under mine their works. We are trying to cut off their communication with MOBILE.'"
- Additional notes: "Much more excellent content, talks about how they are entrenching to avoid the Reb shells, also putting up breastworks. They are planting some big 100 lb. parrot guns. The Rebels have laid torpedoes very thick in the channel which have sunk 2 of their gunboats. The Rebels have also sunk in the ground some torpedoes which have killed quite a number of their men who have walked on them! (the f vot thy mother of the land mines!) Written in a very neat bold hand, nice content concerning BLACK TROOPS and the TORPEDO!"
