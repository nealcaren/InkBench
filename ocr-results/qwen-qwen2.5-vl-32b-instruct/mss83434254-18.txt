- of Color, To Arms!" He published it as a broadside as well as in pamphlet form. Four days later he wrote to Gerrit Smith:

"I have thought much of your letter to Mr. May, expressing the wish that we should send at least one colored company of soldiers from the State of New York to make part of the regiment now forming at Readville, Massachusetts. At first I saw some ground for hesitation. Subsequent reflection and consultation with our friend Mr. George L. Stearns from Boston have convinced me that your suggestion should be carried out. I have therefore already set myself to the work of raising at least one company in this state to be a part of the first colored regiment of Massachusetts. I have visited Buffalo and obtained seven good men. I spoke here (Rochester) last night and got thirteen. I shall visit Auburn, Syracuse, Ithaca, Troy and Albany and other places in the State till I get one hundred men. Charley my youngest son was the first to put his name down as one of the company. It is a little cruel to say to the black soldier that he shall not rise to an officer of the United States whatever may be his merits; but I see that, though coupled with this disadvantage, colored men should hail the opportunity of getting on the United States uniform as a very great advantage. I sent you a few days ago my call upon colored men to enlist. It was published in all the papers here, and is having a good effect.... I shall be in Syracuse on Wednesday for the purpose of getting men for this company, and in Troy on Thursday, Friday in Albany. I shall go to New York and at the request of Mr. Stearns go to Philadelphia and stimulate enlistments there. Returning from Philadelphia I shall revisit the places named and make calls at others in the State, for the purpose of accommodating those who wanted time to decide."

In the April, 1863, issue of DOUGLASS’ MONTHLY, the editor gave considerable space to appeals for enlistment in the 54th Massachusetts. He urged his readers to send him the names of volunteers and told them not to wait until New York State authorized a colored regiment.

**$20,000 ORATORY FROM AN EX-SLAVE**

In March, 1855, Frederick Douglass delivered an address to the New York State Legislature. An eyewitness (William H. Topp, of Albany) describes the crowded audience, and their rapt attention to the speaker, as the grandest scene he ever witnessed in the Capitol. Among those whose eyes were riveted on the speaker full two hours and a half were Thurlow Weed and Lieutenant Governor Raymond; the latter, at the conclusion of the address, exclaimed to a friend, “I would give twenty thousand dollars, if I could deliver that address in that manner.”
