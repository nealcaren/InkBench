Life and escape from bondage

for me to tell, saying, if I told them I should have the volume to keep for my reward. I think I would do volumes. They were published by Joseph Barker of Leeds Yorkshire. I kept my book till 1857 and sold one. I had one stolen, and never have I seen one like it since.

The remembrance of all the above notes prompts me to solicit you and your wife to a trial visit. I have been searching for days to find out your abiding home and failed. Comedy led me to get it until yesterday. Now a line from you will give me pleasure to say when, where, and at what time you can receive a call from me on yourself and wife (whom I have not met). Our homes were not far apart in Salem, Ohio. Do you remember Benjamin Brown, wife of Levi Pennington, the anti-slavery editor? They had an runaway daughter; she married John Denny. Mr. Workers' daughter is married to her, in Salem, Ohio. The Dennys have an exhibit at the Manufacturing Hall. My husband has been in and has not yet got to the Fair. Saw it through my glass on the dedication day. In you awaiting your early answer. With best wishes, Suly, yours. Henrietta Horton Ramser.
