- The handwritten inscription at the top left indicates the book was deposited on October 23, 1843, by T. H. Carlton & Company.
- The notation "Se Vol. 18. p. 326" appears to the right of the handwritten inscription, likely referring to a specific volume and page number.
- The title of the publication is clearly printed as "THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ANNUAL, AND LADIES' REGISTER."
- The year "1844" is centrally positioned below the title.
- At the bottom, the publication information is listed as being based in Boston, with additional distribution points in New York and Philadelphia.
- There is a physical crease visible in the middle of the page, but this is not part of the transcribed text.
