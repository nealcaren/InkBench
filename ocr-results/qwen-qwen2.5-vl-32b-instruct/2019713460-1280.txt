***Annotations and Marginalia:***

* Top Left (Handwritten):  
  "Jan. 31st, 1873."

* Bottom Right (Handwritten):  
  "P. [illegible]"

**Transcription Notes:**  
- The handwritten annotations appear faded and partially worn, impacting legibility.
- The book title and author information are clearly printed and legible.
- The handwritten signature at the bottom right includes the letter "P." followed by an illegible surname or additional text. This could potentially be a note or signature of a previous owner or annotator.
- The book was published in 1860 by J. B. Lippincott & Co., a significant detail about its historical context.
