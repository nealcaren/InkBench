were at your knees. Nevertheless,  
Should you come, a father's house,  
a father's welcome,  
wide be given you. You would  
find me in very pleasant company,  
not quite such as I have on Cedar Hill,  
but very well adapted to  
this climate and country.  
I note what you say of young Cook.  
I am sorry to learn that he has made so little progress.  
I am more sorry still to know that he served Anne with a mean trick. She  
did a good deal for him. That is perhaps, the trouble. Had she done less,  
she would have received more thanks. Gratitude is not a very strong trait  
in the colored race.
