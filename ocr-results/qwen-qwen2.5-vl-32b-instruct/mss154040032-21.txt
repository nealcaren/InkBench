Hull House, Chicago.

**Letter Content:**

My dear Mrs. Catt:

The entire world is poorer because of the passing of that great and noble soul, Jane Addams.

May I thank you for your delightful letter as well as for the W.I.L. check? I sent the latter to Mme. Ramondt, our International Treasurer, and I am sure it will cause much rejoicing in our ranks.

With congratulations to the judges of the award upon their discriminating choice, and to you upon your method of expenditure, I am

Faithfully yours,  

**Signature:**  
Carrie Chapman Catt
