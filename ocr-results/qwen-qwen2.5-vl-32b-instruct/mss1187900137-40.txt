**Mr. B.F. Leighton,**

Dew. sir:

Yours of the 6th inst. was duly received, the contents which was carefully noted by Mr. Lewis Douglas. In reply, he directed me to say that he has no disposition, whatever, to make any change regarding a stone step on the premises referred to in your letter.

On the contrary, he denies mutestyle attention called to the fact that said premises is in immediate need of improvement both in and out, the walls, the broken blinds, and especially the pantry apartments make it almost unbelievable. It is sadly in need of a coat of paint, which, in its continuous position, makes a most detestable appearance. It is the only residence in that immediate neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to the landlord.

Respectfully, yours,  
Joseph Douglas  
259S clerk.
