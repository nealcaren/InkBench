```
The stranger has to adapt himself 
to the country, and I expect he
will be pretty glad when she has
finished "doing" India and she will 
be the happiest woman alive when 
she steps her foot on dear Uncle
Sam's California. Yet I am in no
hurry to return. If I was then in
school and I cannot go home
till my term is closed anyway.
Before coming to America
I read and read and read, stuffing
myself like a fish-man, from exam
```

**Transcription Notes:**
- The text is handwritten in cursive, with some inconsistencies in letter formation.
- The word "Uncle" is used as a colloquial term referring to the United States.
- The phrase "dear Uncle Sam's California" indicates a reference to the United States, specifically California.
- The last sentence about "reading" and "stuffing myself like a fish-man" suggests a metaphor for intensive studying or preparation.
