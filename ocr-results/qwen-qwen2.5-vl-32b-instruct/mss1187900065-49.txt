Ibr. note which I will enclose; and
become its payment by a mortgage on farm
stock, implements, household furniture.
The stock consists of five head, two
milch cows, a fine Andalusian
heifer, 3 yearlings, farming-camera, farming
wagon etc. -- the farming fund and
farming implements are required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at prime terms for
boot; out no far from nice as sold
soon after Spring [Open?], as it is worth
considerably more money.
They would not allow one back this
farm again, but for the absolute existing

brings as cheaper sale, it would
 ruin the sale privately, as jewelry
see at a glance.
Can you help them, in this way of theirs
