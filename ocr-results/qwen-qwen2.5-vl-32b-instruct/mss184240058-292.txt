Dear Jane,

It is nine months since we were last in action, which has made me long for the warmth and camaraderie of our former days. Each memory brings new delight, and I dream of the fires we lit and the journeys we made together. Ah, the joy of our youth!

I have been corresponding with several acquaintances, and my letters have grown longer and more frequent, as I share our experiences and memories with others who, like us, long for the good old days. At times, I find myself writing more to my memories than to anyone else.

I remain,

Your ever-faithful and loving friend,  

[Karin]  

PS. I truly miss our talks and walks under the moonlight. How I wish for a moment's peace with none but you nearby, reminiscing about the laughter and joy we once shared.
