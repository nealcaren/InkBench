Miss Anna Dickinson
Dear Miss Dickinson:

Your valued note of the 6th was duly received.  
I have expressed your thanks to the Indiana State Committee for the more numerous reference to the "Brothers" in the revised notice in our Logansport Journal.
Mother, my brothers, and Tom are well and I am in expressing our high
regard & consideration for you and
yours.
I was yesterday at Indiana
polio where we had a monster dinner.
We hope some of your friends will have a regret for Indiana after the 6th.

I have noted the influence and uniformity you have made where
you have been since coming here.

and feel confidence that your efforts will meet the gratitude in Indiana as well as in Michigan as well as in New York.

Very Respectfully yours.

W.T. Wilson
