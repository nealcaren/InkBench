Dear Grandpa,

We received your affectionate letter on the 12th, and we were very glad to hear from you, and I know that you are getting along nicely. Everything is passing along smoothly here, excepting the weather, which is at times almost intolerable. It is now about nine o'clock and the thermometer stands about 84Â°. Charlie has not left yet for the East, I suppose, and I doubt whether he will or not; I think the latter as I don't hear anything.
