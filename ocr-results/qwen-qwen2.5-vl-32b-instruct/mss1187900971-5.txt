Grandpa was never called "Floyd."
He was first Frederick Bailey, the slave.
Changed to Johnson when he ran away and because the man in whose home he lived in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was named Johnson. This man, who had just finished reading "The Leading the Lake," admired so much the character in the book named "Douglass" that he asked Grandpa to keep from conflicting their two Johnson names. He told him, "Would you like to call himself Douglass instead of Johnson?" Grandpa told him one name to him was as good as another and henceforth set out to be called Frederick Douglass.

These facts—not hearsay.

Later: Just read a letter from Ted—he leaves on his “debating tour” today—and really debates at Howard. He will stop with Dr. and Mrs. Joes [Joe’s] wife & Manie and Aunt Crawford.
