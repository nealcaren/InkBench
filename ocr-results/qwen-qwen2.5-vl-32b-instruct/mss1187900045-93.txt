**Transcription:**

```
we make this our
blissful dwelling-place,
farewells are said.

Remember how much you
understand disquiet
yet—but—let us say,
truly that I never found
my dear Savior to mean less—
amidst my wants and
wretchedness—though I
can realize that “all things”
must wind up.
when we reach
ye glorious
city,
we shall find
a way,
the knowing guide
will lead—
but we must be
humble and
confident.
May we all
live
together,
in peace and
affection.

S.G. Capt.
Dec. 13, 1873
