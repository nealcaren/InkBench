If the colored leaders take to ousting on argument, they will alienate the sympathies of their best friends in with Cool. The abolition of slavery is the prohibition of discriminating State laws, the exclusion of the ballot & the colored man: these are sound. But the colored leaders, if they announce against by law, will also punishing by laws the assault and battery excluding colored people from particular public buildings & hotels of channel, it will look rather childish. It will find that the colored people can mourn for the show than for the substance of citizenship.
