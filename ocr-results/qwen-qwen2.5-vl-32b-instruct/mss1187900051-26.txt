Friend Douglass.  
I started from Rochester yesterday morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake. Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp holes a few north of the Rush Reservoir. I attached a pocket instrument upon the wire and communicated with the person who took my place during my absence. He telegraphed me the substance of your postal card. Before I left home I read your telegram, or went to the Rock San. Bk. where the draft was procured and notified them of its non-acceptance, and of your wish for a duplicate. They said that they could not give another until they had received their copy from the Clearing House at N.Y., which would be the first week.
