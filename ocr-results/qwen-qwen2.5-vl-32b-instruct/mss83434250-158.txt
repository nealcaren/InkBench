From the New York Tribune.

The able argument of William Whiting upon the War Powers of Congress is producing an influence in quarters where it was not supposed that logic and truth could win support to the government.

The pamphlet is winning recognition as one of the positive instrumentalities for the suppression of the rebellion.

Mr. Whiting is an eminent lawyer of Boston, who has won great distinction before the Supreme Court of the United States by his success in important cases under the law in relation to patents. He has now brought all his legal acumen to bear upon an investigation of the subjects set forth in the title of his present work; and the conclusions at which he arrives, by links of argument in which it will be found difficult to detect a flaw, are confirmatory in the fullest degree of the constitutionality of all the powers assumed by Congress and by the President in dealing with this Rebellion.

From the Washington National Republican.

We find upon our table a book containing one hundred and forty-three pages, entitled "The War Powers of the President, and Legislative Powers of Congress, in Relation to Rebellion, Treason, and Slavery. By William Whiting." We recognize the author as one of New England's ablest lawyers. The book exhibits great research, and, it seems to us, is complete and unanswerable in the special work to which it is devoted.

From the Journal, Roxbury, Mass.

Mr. Whiting has made a cogent, clear, and convincing presentation of his ideas. He has examined each point, which he treats with the insight of a man who has other ideas of statesmanship than those involved in caucus or congressional encounters. He has patiently consulted authorities with which to fortify the convictions of his own judgment, and carefully collected facts which bear upon his argument, and with these has built a structure in which Law under the Constitution is the chief cornerstone, and Liberty the grand material of the entire edifice.

We have no room at present to follow him in the detail of his argument. It is our hope hereafter to make extracts from some of his more pungent portions, as they shall be applicable to events closely impending in the future. There is a refreshing atmosphere about the entire essay. Its author starts with the intention of strengthening, not impairing, the powers of the government. He labors in the cause of both Liberty and Loyalty. He has reached the opinion of most patriots of our day, that these have at last become convertible terms. We have been too little accustomed, previously, to find eminent lawyers taking this position. It is none the less grateful for its rarity. We honor Mr. Whiting as one of the pioneers in the movement. All honor to him as a man who can break away from those legal trammels which would make our sacred Constitution a shield for human slavery, the most mischievous form of wrong and intolerance the present generation has known.
