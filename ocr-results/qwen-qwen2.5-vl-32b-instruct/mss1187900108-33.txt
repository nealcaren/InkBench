**OFFICE OF**  
**C. B. BARNES, ★**  
**SECRETARY OF THE**  
**REPUBLICAN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, OF RANDOLPH COUNTY.**

**Cuthbert, Ga., 189—**

Printer,  
I have a few copies of the "Cause." I wish you  
would bind me one of them.  
From Mr. Banglade.  

I wish you to do me this favor as I have spent a great deal  
of money this year for the Republican Cause, and is now  
greatly in debt for the same.  

And the Republican County committee have sent a petition  
to Mr. Grannawalt, Postmaster, asking the appointment of  
Jun. Charles Canntion to the Postoffice at this place  
(Cuthbert Ga.) This will help  
me to draw my home for the money spent for the party.
