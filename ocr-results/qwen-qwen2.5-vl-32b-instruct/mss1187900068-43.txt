Brooklyn, March 7th, 1886  

My Dear Mr. Douglas,  

I send you a clipping from the Brooklyn Eagle of the 6th once and while more beyond your end would not have been considered disingenuous in the columns of a Republican paper, is especially complimentary when it comes from a Red Hot Democrat. All things considered I think you have every reason to congratulate yourself.
