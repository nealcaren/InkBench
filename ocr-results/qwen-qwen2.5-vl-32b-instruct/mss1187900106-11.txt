**Dear Douglas:**

Here I am, away up in the  
Northwest, on my first visit to my youngest  
daughter, Adelle, the wife of H. B. Scott, who  
happens to be absent, just now, in discharge  
of his official duties, at "Soooyoo Lake," in the  
"Okanagan Country," as they call it here. For  
a year and a half, until two weeks ago, it  
almost a perfect blank in my life’s journey.  
To be blind, is a terrible calamity to any human  
being. Since the surgical operation, two months  
ago, which extracted the cataract from my  
left eye, and then waiting for the soreness and  
sensitiveness, to light, to subside two weeks ago  
I got my new spectacles with special glass, suited  
to my left eye, and now, with the aid of that  
glass, I can see almost as well as ever. So much  
for cocaine and for science. Thanks to Providence,  
man’s discovery and skill for [having]  
held out so long. Nature has  
dealt kindly with you and me. We may yet become
