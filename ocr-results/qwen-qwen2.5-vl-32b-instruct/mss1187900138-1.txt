Hon Fred Douglass

Dear Sir

Francis M Addington of  
Weymouth

Mar. 86 Years of Age, under the following  
offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration  
"Father Abraham's Monument."  
This Monument would seem to say  
that Lincoln's dead, but turned to  
in vain the applause aim to play  
In vain his blood was made to flow.  
In vain the vile attempt to kill  
In all our hearts he's living still.  
And while a drop of patriotic blood  
Shall flow in any human frame  
Twill thrill at memory of the good  
The great and noble Lincoln name  
This Monument We raise to thee  
Great Chief Whose Mandate Made us free  
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend  
For thee, our true and constant friend  

Also the following  
"Adieu to America Personified"  
The world is gazing on thee.  
Disperse thy robes with care  
And with thy precious jewels  
Adorn thy golden hair.  
"Over"
