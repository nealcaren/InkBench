### Handwritten Notes (Marginalia):
```
[In the top left corner:]
Sth[?] w[?]egmi[?] 31[?] Sta[d? or -p?] 4, 1822

[In the top center-right area, in cursive script:]

[This part appears heavily faded and difficult to fully decipher.]
```

### Notes:
- The handwritten notes appear to be marginalia and are not a core part of the printed text. They have been captured as accurately as possible, but their readability is limited due to faded ink and smudging.
- The printed text is transcribed exactly as written, including all punctuation and formatting cues.
