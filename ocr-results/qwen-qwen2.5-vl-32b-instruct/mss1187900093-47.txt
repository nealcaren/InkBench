a lecture in Washington - when I said "I will write" and.

This is my letter of inquiry. Have you given up your journey to Haiti? If so, I cannot help being glad as there are a good many reasons why I had rather think of you both as nearer to us. If I could have written as formerly, I should not have so long postponed my inquiries. But I am obliged to curtail my letter both as to number and length.

I hope that it will turn out that you are to pass the winter in your pleasant and comfortable home. Why should you brave the terrors of the seas and many inconveniences when you are so well arranged in your quiet and delightful home? Not for fame or gain these.

We already know both of you. I was glad to see a notice of your lecture and wish that I was there to enjoy it. I'm sure that you can make your experiences very interesting and valuable. And then Mr. Douglass has I doubt not, hands full of literary work about which you can assist him if you have not, as you can do yourself.

I shall write to Mrs. Gladman today and tell her all that I know of your movements - because of so much I am certain, that you cannot lecture in Washington and be also on the road to Point au Prince. I want Mr. Douglass to avoid great mental strain and to indulge his winning years that he may stay as long as possible with us.
