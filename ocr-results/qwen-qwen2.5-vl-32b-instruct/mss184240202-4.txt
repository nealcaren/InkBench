[illegible line]

would take you up

[woven line through text]

[note regarding possibly a new form]

**Note:** The content is highly fragmented and unclear. Several lines are entirely illegible, and attempts to interpret parts of the text are speculative. If additional context or a clearer image is available, it might help improve the transcription accuracy.
