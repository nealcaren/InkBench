**The Light in the Tunnel**
From the **Peoria City Chronicle**
"A new device for the bedevilment of lovers was executed successfully by a heartless young man on the locomotive yesterday. A couple sat in the seat before him. The lady was young and modest, and the swain were very lame suite. One arm was thrown carelessly along the back of the seat, and upon this the evil-minded person rubbed some phosphorus. The affectionate performances of that suitor, when the train was rushing through the kindly darkness of the tunnels, were behold by all the uncaring and mocking occupants of the car, whose cruel enjoyment was not a little increased by the dismayed and unconcerned appearance of the lovers each time the train bounded again into light."

**[Text partially obscured due to angle]**
"The wife of Thomas H. Bonnor of Hagens-
town had been warned before she married him that his temper was violent, and that, sooner or later, he would whip her. She seems to have made up her mind what to do if he struck her, for when he did so, she drew a revolver from her pocket and shot him dead."
