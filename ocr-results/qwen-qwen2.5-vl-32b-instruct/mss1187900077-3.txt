cause that I know she  
done with me. The last  
time I saw her she scarcely  
paid me "the cold respect  
of a passing glance".  As for you,  
Mrs. Putnam, quite just  
when you complain that  
I did not speak of  
the labors in the cause of the  
slave performed by H. Kelly?  
Thinking of the many other  
excellent women who were  
not mentioned.  
Faithfully,  
Fred R. Douglass
