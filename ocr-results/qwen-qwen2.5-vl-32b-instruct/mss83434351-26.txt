### Notes:
1. The table contains expenditures or requisitions for various items and services labeled with unclear or partially legible terms (e.g., "Fray," "Oad," "Valuables").
2. The amounts listed under "Units Required" and "Remarks" are inconsistent in some rows, suggesting possible errors or corrections.
3. The document appears to be related to military logistics or supply chains, as indicated by the reference to troops stationed at Platoon Quarry and the U.S. context.
4. The final totals sum up to 3600 in the "Remarks" column, which may represent a reference to a budget or standard unit measurement.
5. The signatures at the bottom indicate official approval or verification of the requisition.
