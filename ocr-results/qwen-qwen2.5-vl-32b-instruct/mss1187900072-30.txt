**Washington April 10th 1887**

Dear Father,

Your letter dated March 24th was received yesterday. It found us all well, and pleased to hear from you.

Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds, is seriously sick with pneumonia. Gerrit S. Loguen has been appointed deputy Recorder of Deeds. The lawyers are much put out about it.

Senator Sherman is making a trip South in Georgia. A colored delegation called arhis hot[el], and was refused admission. As soon as he heard of it, he paid his bill and went to another hotel. A colored man by the name of Taylor from Kansas has been appointed to the Siberian Mission. The political outlook at present on the Republican side is wavering between Blaine and Sherman.

Congress has made an appropriation for a new Bridge across the Eastern Branch at the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue. Business in the Recorder's Office is booming. Susa[wood], the President of the An[acostia R.R.], is married. Barnsdale has been appointed "Register of Deeds." The President and Mr. Matthews have been taken back in the prompt Confirmation of Mrs. Trotter. They expected he would be rejected. [Dawyer]
