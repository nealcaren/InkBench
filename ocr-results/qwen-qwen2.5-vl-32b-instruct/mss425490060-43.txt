hid a cough and was very
near death when a visitor
to him, Mr. Biggs, our
dentist, here, said
he could cure him, and
but one drop of
turpentine on his nose.
The cough stopped
and he is well and about
to-day. The doctor had
tried everything without
avail, and as they can
not possibly harm him
I thought you might try
it for your husband!
We have too few men
of the caliber of Judge
Terrell to lose them, if
anything can be done to
save themâ€”and I trust
by the time this reaches
you, you will not need
this or any other remedy,
that your husband will
be well on the road to
recovery.
