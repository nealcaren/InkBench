My dear daughter:

Miss Mack came yesterday and brought the boy and visited with me awhile. She said she had a nice trip up and working at home and cleaning away weeds in the back and the like.

We were very glad to talk with you Sunday night. It helped. Parks feels well at present. Brother J. and family are quite well. He doesn't come so often now. They are still working out at Jackson. I hope you are well and won't overwork before you come home. Now that school is out, I suppose some of the children will be over to stay.

Much love from Mother.
