### Notes on Transcription:
- The text is written in a somewhat informal or shorthand style, likely indicating instructions or notes.
- The abbreviation "C.O." at the top could stand for an organizational designation, such as "Circular Order."
- "PUT T.A. Kins 1ST South Carolina" suggests an order related to a specific individual, T.A. Kins, associated with the 1st South Carolina unit.
- "Change Mutinous Conduct" is a directive to address or rectify insubordinate behavior.
- "[Underlined Text] Finds To be shot to [crossed-out text] (CCM, H.C. 10 hours later)" indicates an additional instruction or note, which might be related to a follow-up action or documentation.
- The handwriting is relatively clear, and I have transcribed it as exactly as it appears.

### Marginalia and Index Information:
- On the right-hand side, there is a vertical index tab with typed text:  
  **D18**
  **C.O.46**  
  **Carmarthen**  
  **1st S.C.**
  This likely provides organizational or cataloging information related to the document.
