ers may have so believed, but no one knows what the members of the organizations thought.” All I said was that the leaders of the two societies so believed. Look at Page 249, near the bottom, and you will find that this was so.

In describing the division, I followed the lines of the statement published by my father in the Woman's Journal of March 11, 1899. That statement was written by me. My father preferred to put his name to it because he thought it would bring down considerable odium upon us from the old “rationals,” and he wanted that odium to fall upon himself and not upon me. To his surprise, the odium failed to materialize. I don’t suppose the rationals approved of it, but they seemed to recognize that it was a moderate and not an ill-natured statement of our case. And they knew that we might easily have made it very much worse.

You seem to think it a pity that the subject has been reopened, and you say you think I have given the National “some unjust whacks.” I have tried to be fair, and to err, if at all, on the side of mildness. You must remember that a whole series of unjust aspersions have been given to the American side, and there has been no whack back, except that one article in the Woman’s Journal, 31 years ago. Mrs. Stanton and Miss K Anthony placed in all the principal libraries of the United States, and in many abroad, their *History of Woman Suffrage*, in which they are immensely praised and glorified, and which contains their version of the split; and it is also given in their biographies. You say yourself that the History is unjust to the American, and you also say that you lay awake at night after reading the life of Miss Anthony, because it was so unjust to my mother. The recent Life of her by Rheta Childe Dorr is much worse than Mrs. Harper’s. Its references to my mother are quite spiteful. Mrs. Dorr says she sprang into notice through keeping her own name, and that her suddenly-acquired fame turned her head, and she was never good for much afterwards; that the American W.S.A. was organized mainly to boost the Republican party; that my mother’s chief object seemed to be to oppose everything “her former friend,” (Miss Anthony) wanted to do; and other things equally absurd. (These quotations are not verbatim; I have not the book here, but that is the substance of them.)

After all this, when I wrote my mother's life, could it be reasonably expected that I should not state her side of the case, in a matter where her motives had been so much misrepresented?

It is proverbial that when a lie once gets started, the truth can seldom catch up with it. This is even more true when the lie has got more than 40 years start, and has already gone all over the world. I am not sanguine enough to suppose that my belated book can counteract the version which has so long been current; but it seemed to me that the facts should be stated, if only in the interest of correct history. But I am truly sorry to have worried you so much. I too lay awake all night, the night after your letter came.

I think your review does my book both more and less than justice. It is not “a great book.” It is not nearly as lively and amusing as Mrs. Dorr has made hers. On the other hand, I do not think I have confused gossip with facts. As for the disproportionate space which you think I gave to the division as compared with my mother’s work during the last part of her life, I felt bound to record the facts of the division, as they are accessible nowhere else, and I was strictly limited as to space by the publisher. Besides, I did not feel able to make interesting to a modern reader the details of the assiduous campaign that my parents kept up for suffrage as long as they lived, and thought the best thing I could do was to condense it. They died before the picturesque and spectacular period of great parades etc., began. Perhaps this was a mistake. I am greatly dissatisfied with my own book, and do not think it begins to do my mother justice.

But "He does well who does his best." Is he weary? Let him rest.
