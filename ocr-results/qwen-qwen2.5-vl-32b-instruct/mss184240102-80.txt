**Friday March 8**

**My dear friend,**

My dear friend,  
Since I was to dine with you, just yesterday,  
But I could not have met you.  
I was with Mrs. L. Darnell  
Much disappointed to be  
Not able to meet my Mother  
Or to enjoy myself in  
The delightful self you enjoy.  
Do like all we do.  
I pray for this glorious  
Day to come.  
But, alas! no weather kills  
More if it was one long summer.
