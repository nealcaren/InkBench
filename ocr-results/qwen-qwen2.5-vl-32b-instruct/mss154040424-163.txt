Six years; six years to observe the infirmities of American politics,  
you have had, women of America. Will you allow any power whatsoever to steal  
from you the significance of the vote you struggled so long to win? My  
suggestion is probably impractical. The only thing certainly right about  
it is the proposal of rebellion. No wrong was ever righted by obedience  
to those who have sponsored that wrong. Wrong was ever righted by rebellion  
against those who stand for that wrong. Think it over, pray, think again.  
Keep on thinking. You will find a way. When you have it, arise, put aside  
your ease, your soft indulgences. There is work for you. The primaries  
need reforming, the parties need renovating and all politics need disinfecting.  
Is it true that you women have no influence as regulators, as standpatters?  
Then try the path of rebellion and blaze a new trail to decency and honor  
for your party and your nation. You can have influence if you will. Yes,  
a hundred fold more influence than the Pennsylvania statesman has now.

But you can only win through rebellion. The times call for the fighting  
spirit of the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence. You have  
influence whenever you are ready to fight for it. When that time comes,  
you women will not fight alone. There will be plenty of splendid, big-  
souled American men to fight by your side. Do not forget that they are many-  
the men who bore the humiliation of being so-called rubber stamps before you  
were enfranchised. There is a qualm that one is striving to make  
the fight is strong aed. It's great to be out where the heaviest troops belong.  
"Fight there for man and God."

Park with its duties who they think they know.  
"Welcome men when come the old.  
Then fear men who are your own sons."
