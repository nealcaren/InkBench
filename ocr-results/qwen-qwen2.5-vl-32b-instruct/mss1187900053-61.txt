Dear Mr. Douglas,

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and Christy wrote in hopes of provoking a reply. We really are very much in the dark about you, I doubt even know whether you still hold office under the Government, as we have not been the contrary. I conclude that you do—therefore, that you have not been inspecting or holding meetings over the country this last month as of old. I hope that your health is good—and that you can report well of yourself, of your family.
