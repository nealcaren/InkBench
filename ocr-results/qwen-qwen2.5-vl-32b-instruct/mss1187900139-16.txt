and I am sure she would find many old friends.  
Let me urge you to honor us by your presence, and welcome you on behalf of our wife as a brother alumna.

As I am uncertain of your address, I send under cover to Miss Clara K. Hill, Boston.  
Sincerely hoping for 
the pleasure of seeing you and Mr. Douglas,  
I am most cordially yours,  
S. A. Brodyette
