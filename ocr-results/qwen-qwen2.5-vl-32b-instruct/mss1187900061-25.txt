Legation of the United States,  
Monrovia, Liberia,  
July 25, 1873.

Honorable  
Frederick Drew Douglas,  
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglas:  

Enclosed speech delivered on the occasion  
commemorating Emancipation in the District of Columbia  
and I was particularly edified  
and pleased by your utterances,  
and surprised at the vigorous  
brilliance of your powers after  
an almost constant absence  
of them for nearly a half  
century in the cause of oppressed  
people.
