I hope we all now at the Wick
to skate and skater unitedly
eight when I came in and
left sitting down a desk of
mine candle they all have candles
on for and bringing music
with me and if it is attended
that you would have them
well with my blues things.  I was
just letters short as [illegible]
bedtime and we amused to
up at four oâ€™clock.
John should like it
to hear from home once a while
and you shall hear from me
I know this is not a good
writing as you would know but I am
in haste to say
Yours with affectionate love
from Charles R. Douglas
