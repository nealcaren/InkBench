**"Nempa back on the farms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets."**  
During recent months, it has become apparent that state control in markets where out-of-state milk is imported in volume was not enough. Despite the fact that efficient operation of federal and state control agencies, working in cooperation, is likely to lessen somewhat the need for producer associations, there should be no worry lest the control agencies would put the cooperatives out of business. Control administrators have publicly stated that farmer associations were essential for the smooth operation of the dairy industry.

It now appears that the revised Boston milk marketing agreement, being written under AAA auspices, may never reach a final, acceptable form. The various parties to the writing of the agreement seem determined that they shall not be forced to concede an inch. In view of the fact that Administrator Samuel W. Tator has reminded New England that the agreement is purely voluntary and that he will eventually tire in his efforts to secure the agreement, such tactics are foolhardy.

**Republicans are evidently going to harp on it from now on.**  
While one finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the New Haven ex-mayor that it is more a part of a national conspiracy for Gov. Cross to fail to mention the Roosevelt administration than it would have been for him to praise it, the poetic English in which the governor did his praising two years ago does seem to lend some significance to his failure to mention it now. In 1933, the governor, formerly dean of the Yale graduate school and veteran professor of English literature, found his soul stirred, when speaking for New Haven's present mayor, to this glowing passage:

> Over the horizon and the hills,  
> the sun has appeared, the eternal  
> symbol of hope and life. We are  
> quickened by a stirring of new  
> faith and courage in a new deal.  
> The dawn of better and happier  
> days under the smiling, hopeful  
> leadership of President Roosevelt  
> tints the east with gold.

The fact that the shrewd old gentleman who occupies the governor's chair down in Hartford isn't saying anything just now about "the horizon" and "the hills" and the "new deal" may perhaps be explained on other grounds than those supplied by New Haven's Republican ex-mayor. It may be, as some shrewdly suggest, that the Democratic mayor of New Haven, having made a good record, deserves reelection on that as the chief issue. It may also be that the Democrats, who generally suffered in the Connecticut city and town elections not long ago, have found that the new deal isn't altogether their best talking point, in Connecticut. And it may be that "Uncle Toby," as his intimate admirers still call Gov. Cross, having been quoted during the summer as making occasional remarks which indicated about the same affection for the new deal and its economics as has been shown by ex-Gov. Ely, doesn't see the new deal quite as he did in 1933 and just doesn't want to talk about it anyway. Perhaps his silence can be explained in all three ways.

An American mining engineer who lately visited Eritrea says that he found there "a boom such as America experienced years ago on mining frontiers in the West." Why not, with a big army using it as a base? But a mining boom is based on gold dug from the ground, not on wealth dug from the pockets of harassed taxpayers back home.

**"NEW MEASURES"**  
[Kansas City Star]  
**This and That**  
Boycotts, if unofficial, are included among sanctions, but in cases they are fairly effective. like of the Hitler regime by Jew liberals outside of Germany has German business a formidable The Chinese boycott of Japanese goods was so wide-spread at its that Japan was forced to use extreme measures to force the Chinese government into suppressing the rebellion, and even now trade is hindered by a strong popular prejudice against Japanese wares.

For a spontaneous and unorganized boycott to be very serious, however, strong public feeling has to be raised to a very high pitch. In general terms, the desire for a bar count for much more. Why fascist forces should turn this way or that an international articles of merchandise is a complicated question which resolves the most experienced importance. Chance may have something to do with it, but the main thing is that a particular country or another either gets a reputation for producing the best or cheapest goods in some particular line, or happens to send at the right moment goods which become the vogue because they click with current tastes.

Some exponents of a variant of an economic interpretation of history would have us believe that the reputation enjoyed by the products of certain countries is wholly a matter of national prestige. The world must drink French wines not because the vintages of champagne, Burgundy, and Bordeaux are superior, but because French generals won so many victories and made France "a grand nation." If the World War had ended otherwise, they say, the world would have decided that German wines were much superior, and if Italy never should rise to the crest of the wave as Fascists hope, then the wines of Chianti, Orvieto, Capri, and Ravello would soon be voted incomparable and the producers of California would be doing their best to copy them.

Connoisseurs in wine may be left disposed of this cynical slur, but much support for the national prestige theory of taste can be found in current fashions. It would be hard to trace any connection between the increased prestige of the Soviet republic, for example, and the lively interest of American shoppers in a considerable line of Russian goods, from blouses up and down, but not quite down to safety matches.

Soviet matches have improved even now the best to be said for them is that they are more likely to burn than if the box said "Made in Japan." And the best to be said for Japan's matches is that their producers showed positive genius in discovering that by coloring their matches trifling costs their wares could be shipped to the United States as fancy ornamental matches with a lower duty to pay.

That the prestige of the Soviet Union has little or nothing to do with the liking for Russian goods shown in this country in recent years is shown by the favor also extended to so many lines of goods from Czechoslovakia, which is too small and too stable a country to be an international strongpoint. All that can be said of these wares, some of them decorated in bold and effective Slavic style, is that they appealed to the taste of many buyers and are sold at prices which suggest a bargain.

Nor can the national prestige of Mexico be regarded as the cause of the recent popularity of many Mexican products, from glassware to wall decorations. In general, buyers want what they want and do not care greatly what country it comes from, except in so far as a particular product carries a national label.
