``90''  

The text is centered and includes the following:

``Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1867, by Charles C. Roberts, in the Clerkâ€™s Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts.``

This appears to be a copyright notice, indicating the registration of a work in 1867.  

**Markings:**
- In the top left corner, there is a handwritten number ``90``.
- In the bottom right corner, there is a faded pink number or letter, possibly ``18`` or part of it.
