**Dictated**

My Dear Mrs. Catt:

I am in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit #780, at Los Angeles, at the present with a fractured leg. I have been here 8 weeks today.  I hope soon to be released from this terrible home of torture, at least so that I can return to my little apartment at 609 Fairview, E. Pasadena, Calif. Many friends have been wonderful to me in many ways.

Address my close friend Mrs. Lois Jeskula, 1718 Oak St., E. Pasadena, who has all of me in charge.

Cordially  

Henrietta G. Moore
