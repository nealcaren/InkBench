It seems like a demand  
to enlarge apropos  
very much we enjoyed  
your  
visit among us, and how  
sad we should be again  
to welcome you. Should  
you be tempted once more  
to cross "the waste of waters"  
though we are all  
pitifully  
but among some  
of our excellent  
and friends: sickness and  
death have been  
present.  
Dear coupling mine, this  
letter, who remembered  
your visit to [Belgian?] forty-two  
years ago, and thought  
how to welcome you  
last  

[Note: The handwriting is quite cursive and slightly difficult to decipher. In some cases, words like "Belgian?" are approximations. If any part is unclear, you should pause or seek clarification.]
