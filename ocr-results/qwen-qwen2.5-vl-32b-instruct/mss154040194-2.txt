Dear Mrs. Chapman,

As to the lectures of Tamou Boman, "Woman Jamison" and others, in our program for this year, I had planned to read them in the L. S. T. (League of Women's Culture) and in popular evening courses. But as there are no complete libraries in Romania and not "a single feminist library," it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books, never mind popularizing them. I therefore ask the other sections of the U.S.A. to assist you.

Feeling so much the lack of a public library here, we found that at B. and we have tried at one time with our studies to assemble one, but it took a long time. Now we dream of having a women's movement in our country and especially books, where we could find biographies of your famous women.

We would speak of a series of lectures on political and social questions for the benefit of all women, and we would like to know more about you, your famous women. But we know so little; it is a great pity.
