### Handwritten Text
**Date:** 22 June 1947

**Text:**
Dear Mrs. Chapman Cott,

I just finished the **superb book**  
about the great work you have  
accomplished during your  
wonderfully active life.  
This book is a **grand inspiration**  
for all of us in every country.  
I was deeply moved by the pages  
on your international work and  
the meetings unshaven Jew of  
which I was fortunate enough

### Notes:
- The handwritten text appears to be a draft or a personal note, likely incomplete or a work-in-progress.
- Crossed-out sections include:
  - A small portion at the start of the letter, possibly an error or a correction made mid-sentence.
  - Other small markings above and below the text, which seem to be additional notes or adjustments.
- The overall tone is respectful and appreciative, suggesting the sender is admiring Mrs. Chapman Cott's work and achievements.
