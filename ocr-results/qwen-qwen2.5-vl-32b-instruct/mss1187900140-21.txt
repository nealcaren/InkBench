by Paris. You really ought to be here. Spring becomes a warning, by reason you must make our home your home & head-quarters for the South of England. We are living in a very pretty country district, with fine open downs, a pleasantly hilly & undulating county, not grand in its features but very pleasing. Should like to lake you where our favorite walks are to introduce you to some of our kind friends.

My dear Mother is still living - always able to congregate.
