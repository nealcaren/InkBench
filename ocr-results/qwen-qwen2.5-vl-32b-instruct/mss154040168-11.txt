with enthusiasm—have been much
appreciated—more than you can know.
Sam longing to hear when—when you as ignorant
as a mild tint—Ben and Sam lingering
long, but the mail does not reach
Panama after thou gone.  You can be
the best correspondent for your
letters are always welcome.  Oh!
Learn that mails are not carried by
this foot to N. Y. but put off at the
mail and goes up by rail as you will
get them soon.  I won't fast to Panama.
Please accept my collective letters
as one for you.  I must go onward.
Dear Mrs. Smith, the mildew is
a very loving mother!
