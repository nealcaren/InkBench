Dear Miss Blackwell,  

I am blessed with a propensity to be always at something. You are something; still you will not draw an illogical conclusion, as three successive spritters might tempt a less reasonable creature to do.  

The truck is hot, hot beyond cred, to say nothing of dead. What resource else was left but you?  

The other evening so to so was spoken of to me as having done this and that as nurse in the war. I was called on to admire her. I had to say, yes, I admire what she did. But must she not be a noble woman to do so much. Then I said, it's my will for us you and she to some good. I'm the only recommendation we can have; but really I look to see one who deeds, not creed to recommend him, seeing whom one thinks not how much he has done, but how much he is.  

I proceeded I was talking Greek,  
+ untold folly, but you who understand Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
