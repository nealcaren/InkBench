department—but have not received any answer yet. I expect one tonight. It has been beautiful weather ever since you left, and I do not think we will have much snow, but it will be keen and sharp. Elizabeth is making preparations to read her lecture next Monday night and leave us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. She seems more nervous lately—appointments, yes—but I think Rhoda Wilmot will attend it. There has been a great deal of noise and confusion lately at the schoolhouse, and the few who have dined are as full of mischief as possible. I hope you will have as comfortable a time as possible and won’t return homesick. Old Bloom has returned; the Governor of Wisconsin has renewed to him the lease he lost, and while Peter (I don’t know that I mentioned that in a former letter) has offered his capture, and Daniel Brooks, by my advice, has given himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love to you, and I enclose you will find a note from Elizabeth, and perhaps Annie will send a few lines.

Your affectionate daughter,  
Rosetta Douglass
