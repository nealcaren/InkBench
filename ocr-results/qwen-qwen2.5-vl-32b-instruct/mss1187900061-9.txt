Instead of making murrain rosettes, I would try to send you a line. I hope you will excuse Dad's writing and spelling, as you will find. I have seen Miss Rogers twice since you left. Everything is going on just the same, so I have no news to tell. We are all well at home, hoping that you are. Rosa is well and sends love to you.

Truly your friend,  
Louisa Sprague
