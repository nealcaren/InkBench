**Curse rather than a blessing.** I would not, at once, entirely emancipate him from the control of his master. But it should not be, as now, an arbitrary, unqualified control. For that control, I would substitute the authority of law, which should be supreme. In saying this, sir, I do but carry out a principle which has long been dear to me as an Anti-mason. I have maintained, and still maintain, and shall continue to maintain, as a cardinal principle in my political creed, that, in opposition to all individual, and all associated, self-constituted, authority, THE LAWS should be maintained in full and uncontrolled supremacy. There is no being, entitled to the appellation of *man*, who should not find shelter under the ægis of their broad and ample protection. In applying this principle to the case of the slave, however, I would not confer upon him the same rights which are possessed by his master; and, for the obvious reason, that he is not fitted to enjoy them. But I would place him under the supervision of laws made for his special benefit, and adapted to his new condition—laws which should essentially qualify the control of the master over him, and protect him in all the rights which he is fitted to enjoy, and prepare him for the enjoyment of those to which it would be but a suicidal philosophy immediately to admit him. Sir, we owe it to this degraded race of men to prepare them for freedom; to communicate to them moral and religious and literary instruction; to restore and protect the domestic relations among them; to teach them the duties which they owe to God, and to us, and to one another; and to build upon the foundation of a conscious responsibility to the government of Heaven and the authority of righteous human laws, a social structure which it shall be our glory to rear, and their highest earthly happiness to enjoy.

That, Mr. Speaker, while I thus repudiate the doctrine of the immediate and unqualified abolition of slavery, I maintain the duty of immediately and absolutely abolishing the slave trade within the limits of this District. And here I come to a part of the subject which gentlemen do not choose to approach, but manifestly desire to avoid. In this I commend their prudence. The slave trade is an evil for which they well know there is no defence, and no palliation. I regret, sir, that I have not the means of ascertaining its extent and character within this District. But the fact that I have not such means furnishes a strong argument for referring these petitions to a select committee, raised for the purpose of going into a full investigation, and making a full report of the facts connected with this traffic. I can, at present, only say, I am well assured that the trade is actively carried on in the cities both of Washington and Alexandria,* especially in the latter, where a large receptacle for securing of slaves purchased in this District and the surrounding country, from which they are, from time to time, shipped to supply the markets in the Southern and Southwestern ports of the United States. I need not say that, what is usually connected with the slave trade elsewhere is connected with it here—the forced and final separation of parents and children, of brothers and sisters, of husbands and

more obvious than the danger of failing to accomplish any thing by a premature effort to accomplish at once all that an ardent philanthropy may desire.

I have said that the public sentiment at the North is not understood on this subject. I believe, sir, it is greatly misunderstood. A large majority of the people are opposed to certain views and measures, connected with the proposed abolition of slavery in the States; but they entertain, at the same time, an irreconcilable aversion to the institution of slavery, in all its forms. The most conclusive evidence of this is furnished in all the proceedings at the North, which have been adverted to, in this debate, as an index of public sentiment there. Thus, the preamble to the Boston resolutions declares—"We hold this truth to be indis- putable, that the condition of slavery finds no advocates among our citizens. Our laws do not authorize it; our principles revolt against it; our citizens will not tolerate its existence among them."

This, sir, expresses, I believe, the universal sentiment at the North on this subject. It is a sentiment which is not the production of a momentary excitement, but is deeply seated in the sober and settled convictions of the public mind. And, sir, let me assure gentlemen that no expressions of disapprobation in regard to the measures of "abolitionists," or doubts as to the practicability of immediate emancipation, are to be taken as evidence that the "principles" of the Northern people have ceased to revolt against slavery; or that they will not avail themselves of every suitable occasion to discuss it, as well as of all reasonable and constitutional means of remedying the evil. The slavery of the States they know they cannot reach, but by moral influence; and that influence they think can be made most effectual through kind and respectful, though earnest and urgent, appeals to the Southern interest and the Southern conscience. But slavery here, they regard as within the competency of national legislation, and hold themselves, in common with the whole country, directly responsible for its continuance. And I need hardly say that there is a very general desire that measures may be immediately taken, looking to its final abolition; and especially that what has, by almost the whole civilized world, come to be accounted "piracy upon the high seas," shall no longer be suffered to go unpunished and unmolested in the capital of this Republic.

The venerable member from Massachusetts (Mr. Adams) has said, and said truly, that opposition to slavery is, with the people of the North, a religious principle. An honorable gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Jones) replies, by asking, with emphasis, whether it is the religion of the Saviour of men? Sir, I did not expect to hear such a question seriously proposed here. I was not prepared to feel in the sense of that religion that the holding of human beings as property. Sir, what is the great, leading, moral precept put forth by that Saviour, whose name is thus invoked to sanction the practice of slavery?

" ‘All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.’ ”

Sir, I will attempt no commentary on this precept. It needs none. I will only say that it contains the seminal principle of the pure and elevated morality of the Christian system—a morality so congenial with the spirit, and so constantly enforced by the example of its Divine Author, while upon earth.

Now, sir, let gentlemen show me that Africans are not men," and I will give up the argument. But, until this is done, until the declaration is blotted from the Book of Revelation, that "God hath made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth," and until this great truth ceases to find a response in every human bosom, shall slavery stand rebuked by this all-comprehensive and sublime precept of the Saviour of men.

But, sir, the religion which contains this precept, also enjoins submission to the powers that be." The same mouth which uttered it, said, "render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s"—a precept coincident with that which exhorts—"servants be obedient to your own masters; not answering again; not purloining," but showing all good fidelity." The Saviour made it no part of his business, while upon earth, to subvert the existing order of things,

In the first place, let it be observed, the power of Cong—
