Captain Dunstall's and one Democratic paper  
describing the two varieties. She didn't get anything  
until Chin Camp.  Distillers definitely stated they  
could ship the [illegible] at #3 per 100.  Just why  
anyone in that office shouldn't run a newspaper  
as a mystery showed that they must think the  
campaign consumed entirely 7 paper-dealers.  
The reason is that Rochester didn't get its head  
[illegible] itself that they must get their  
quarters demand for May 2.  And the Captain's  
quarters demand, my Conference cannot handle  
them home with them.  That is a long  
demand home with them.  Please see what is  
far [illegible] the matter and who doesn't know about  
their paper.  Second scarcely [illegible].
