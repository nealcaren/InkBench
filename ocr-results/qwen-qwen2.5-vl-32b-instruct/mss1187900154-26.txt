**My dear M. Douglass:**  

Last morning a case had put off  
汇 us calling us for Mr. Douglass That  
shall have been knowing do make  
excuses to join my wife for me. Remember  
her with as much honor in Paris. I hope  
him to Chicago later in the summer.  
Then I will not fail to join both.  
The meanwhile, believe me,
