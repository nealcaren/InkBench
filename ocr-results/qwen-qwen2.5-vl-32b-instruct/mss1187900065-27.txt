The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  
Headquarters, Fourth Avenue cor. 22nd Street.

New York, January 9th, 1885

To  
The Probate Judge of Hudson County, N.J.  

Sir,  
I enclose herewith the Last Will and Testament of Miss Ottilia Arzing, who died, as I am informed in the City of Paris, France, August 21st, 1884. I have decided not to offer the same for probate, because I do not propose to qualify as executor; but, in view of the fact of other persons having interests in the estate under the will in question, I deem it my duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to your entertaining an application for administration on the estate without the will annexed. 

I beg to state, however, that it is the intention of The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, on the death of the trustees mentioned in the will, & claim the property to which it is entitled.  

I have the honor to remain,  
with great respect,  

[Signature]  
Alonzo Beych  
President.
