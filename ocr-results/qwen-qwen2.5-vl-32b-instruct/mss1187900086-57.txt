My dear Bassett,  

Soon after your previous excellent letter, and before I could see him about the Consulship to St. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, without note or warning, departed from Washington for Bar Harbor, where he now is and is expected to remain till October; at least so say the papers. He evidently found the climate of Washington at this season, combined with the pressure of his office, too much for him. In my last interview with him, I was convinced that his toil, and anxiety, had made inroads upon his health and constitution, and that he must either take rest, or none, or he would take harm. For this, and other reasons knowing that a personal interview with him would be far better for me than writing him, I have not mentioned the St. Thomas proposal to him as yet. The President, too, is so much out of the city, going so often and staying so briefly in the capital, and giving his time so exclusively when here to the members of his Cabinet, that I have been unable to see him since Mr. Blaine's departure.  

It is understood here that no Consular appointments will now be made in the absence of Secretary Blaine, hence no progress
