**Going back until I was left with a very thin line. I had been directed to remain until an officer came to me with orders to retire. That the enemy might not suspect our movement, I was told to have my men keep up a fire along the picket line, discharging their guns at intervals. I remained for two hours, going back and forth along my line, seeing that my men kept up the shooting. As no officer arrived to tell me to come in, I got uneasy, and finally concluded our force had retired and we were forgotten. Acting on this belief, I collected my men, fired one last shot, and prepared to return to camp. The night was very dark, and we could only guess at the course we ought to go. Fortunately we guessed correctly, and in a little while emerged from the wood into the open field in sight of our camp, where we could see light or two burning. We were soon safe in camp, to learn that the boys had returned, and were asleep. We were glad to be back safe and sound, but mad that we had been left as we were. Whose fault it was that we were thus left we never learned. As we were marching toward camp we could hear the Johnnies shoot occasionally, showing they believed we were still in the wood. The next day their picket line was reestablished at the old place in the open field, where it remained until we left Dutch Gap on September 28th.**

**CHAPTER XX.**

**ON TO NEW MARKET HEIGHTS.**

On page 944 of Volume V. of Bates’ History of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, it is stated that “until near the close of August the Sixth was kept almost constantly on duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg.” This is clearly a mistake, as we went to Dutch Gap during the first week in August, immediately after the battle of the Crater in front of Petersburg, and remained there until September 28th. On the latter date we were ordered to prepare ourselves with rations for three days, and to leave behind all men who were unfit for a heavy march. The order was received during the day, and before dark our regiment was on a steamer, ready to proceed down the James. We started about dark, and before midnight were put on shore at Deep Bottom, where we rested without shelter of any kind until morning.

Those who are familiar with the movements of our troops under Grant during the siege of Petersburg, will remember that on September 29th, 1864, General Warren was pushed out on the extreme left of our line, in an effort to capture the Weldon railroad, while at the same time the 10th corps, commanded by Birney, and the 18th corps, under Ord, were thrown against Richmond, on our extreme right.
