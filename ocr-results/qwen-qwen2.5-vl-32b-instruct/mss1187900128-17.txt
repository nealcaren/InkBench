I know not where to find justice for them! I appeal to your judgement. I have ever been friendly to the coloured race, having lived many years at Cape Hayti in the Island of St. Thomas, when my husband, under the name of Wilson, Paroche, & Co., was interested in the purchase of coffee for the house of Wilson, Laroche, & Co.  We were well known to the parent President of Hayti, as also when the recognition of Hayti was affected by him.  I know with Janes [James McRee] in the State Department. Be so kind as to write for no influence public opinion in the favor of the coloured people. Begging you to excuse me for addressing you, I remain

Very Respectfully  
Frances L. Wilson
