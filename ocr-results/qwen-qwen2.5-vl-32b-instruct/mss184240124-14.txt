**Dear Miss Dickinson:**  

I am sorry it is impossible for me to answer intelligently the questions you ask, for the reason that I am not strictly speaking a theatrical man, simply a business Manager. I have, however, asked Mr. Lindsay Morrison, who is Manager of the Boston Theatre, and a gentleman who is thoroughly posted in matters of this kind, to reply to your favor.  

Thanking you for your kind wishes, I remain,  
Very truly yours,  

[Henry D. Turner]
