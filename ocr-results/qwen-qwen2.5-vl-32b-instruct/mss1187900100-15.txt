**Bailey, Tenn. Nov. 9th 1891**

Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement afoot here  
to move three thousand families out West. We are trying making every  
effort to get up the money. In the  
name of God we call upon you to assist  
us & get your friends to assist. How  
this vale comes directly from the  
Cabins of the poor oppressed down trodden  
outcast Southern Negroes. If the  
Northern people upon to help us, we are  
dead men without a hope. All we want  
is to get away from our oppressors  
then we can educate our children  
We have sent out several letters to remote  
friends; we ask you to do the same on  
behalf of poor suffering humanity  
for reference of writer address.
