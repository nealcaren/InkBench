Wells! you know we are in a wilderness, & when  
it is nothing in money  
it is everything in  
the truth, & in what  
it does for the future  
for other causes. - Our  
men were so apart  
already wrong and  
discharged from  
as was done two  
years ago - to take  
no such chances while  
disputing on the  
amount of damage
