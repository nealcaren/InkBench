RUTH McCORMICK,
DENEEN SOUND
CAMPAIGN CRIES

HEALTH QUEEN

Senator Attacks County
Administration.

BY PARKIE BROWN

Both Senator Deneen and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, who has announced her candidacy to succeed Senator Deneen, addressed a meeting yesterday that was construed as a de facto to see the actual campaign start ed.  Although such a date was set tentatively last week in January for the opening of 
real hostilities.

Senator Deneen addressed more than 
105 of his followers—Chicago ward committeemen, Republican national 
committeemen, and officeholders—at a 
luncheon at the Hotel Morrison.  It 
was Senator Deneen’s first speech 
since the primary campaign.  At 
that luncheon he made public part of 
his charges against Mrs. McCormick 
in the booths in the polls.

Mrs. McCormick, just before leav ing the train, issued a statement charg ing that a “propaganda factory” is cir culated false rumors that she is a 
bona fide “yellow dog” candidate that 
neither she nor does all she expects to 
win the nomination.

“Since the election of 1928,” read 
Senator Deneen’s memorandum, “I 
have watched the methods and the 
means by which Mrs. Ruth Hanna 
McCormick has made her canvass, 
which, to my mind, have been 
hoodwinked, and in part have permit ted unwary motives to influence their 
votes. In part they have been 
influenced by small favors to them 
and in a degree by the cohesive pow
er of public plunder.

“Penalry for Bankrupcty.
 “The chief characteristic of public officials which has been ap proved or tolerated by our people is 
moral bankruptcy—more so in 
Chicago than any other city or 
hamlet.

“The economic laws have moved 
slowly but mightily against the con
dition of public office and the leathery 
of the public itself.

“We are to pay for it in high taxes:
 “We are to pay for it in our high taxes; 
we are to be bled white to conduct the government day 
by day; impaired police and fire protection; 
timid and ineffective health 
city; in the public health, the poor and 
the sick must suffer, and the children 
and the youth of the city. must be de

THE HUB — By HENRY 
 C. LYTTON & SONS

Senator Deneen Prejudges 
the Issues.

“In this great campaign let us em
phasize those appeals to voters 
prejudices of our citizens and not 
prejudices to determine their votes 
who are equally unworthy and merit 
punishment and my own prospec
tion.

“The task of equalizing the bur
dens of government and restoring 
prosperity must function through ap
peals for the best judgement of our 
citizens.

“Let those who vote for illegal 
favors and for hire, and those who 
grant illegal favors and try to 
bribe be exposed as the enemies of the gov ernment and of the people.”

Detective Gehrmann in his manu
script—also told his followers that his 
group has made no deal on a combina 
tion ticket with any 
Republican leader outside its own fold.

Mrs. McCormick’s statement is as 
follows:
