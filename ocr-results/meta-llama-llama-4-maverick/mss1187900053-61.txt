Dear Mr Douglas 
May 16th 1849

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you or heard from you, and it is long in pro-
voking a reply.  We really are
very much in the dark about-
you, & do not even know whether
you still hold office under the
Government, as we have not been
told.  I conclude that you
have been busily looking
over the military list - which
as of old.  I hope that you
is [sic] well & that you could report
will if you please of your family
