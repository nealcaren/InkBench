My dear Mollie:-

I gave you a hip for a cable and none is here.  Je remain
anxious day after day that I suppose
is in the direculum & request and that you 
hon with Cabled it all.

Meh 27. I was unrelieved here and non sent
at things as deferred and time has passed.
Your cable has been received. and it was such
a relief to imagine you passing through 
discouraging stags when you think you
never will be well again and when life has 
lost all to ferver.  Had. Keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. Iam so glad
you are bitter. this would be a
black old place without you. I
expected tomany you a note here
hesound Ltin at of was a good
cable for it would be a good mail
calam, but it secures many American
