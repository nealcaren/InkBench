The document appears to be a military order from the American Civil War era, specifically from the headquarters of the 67th United States Colored Troops (USCT) at Port Hudson, dated July 7, 1863. The main content of the document is a brief directive: "Turn over at once All Surplus." This suggests an instruction to immediately transfer or account for surplus resources, supplies, or equipment. 

The notation on the folder tab seems to be a later addition, possibly for filing or cataloging purposes, referencing "62 L day" and "few Hdqrs Tulley," which may relate to a different document or context.
