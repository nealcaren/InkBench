LAW OFFICE OF
ROBERT G. INGERSOLL,
1421 NEW YORK AVENUE.

WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov 6, 1883

Dear Stoddard,

I think the quotation
at the head of your article
a little bit off color. There
is an appeal to mercy
to men to Justice -
I think the following from
the same play is better,
" You take my house when you
do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; You
take my life, when
you do take the means
whereby I live"
You will pardon
the egestion, Maud[?] day?

You will pardon
the egestion, Maud[?] day? 
is written on the original, with "You will pardon the egestion, Maud[?] day?" appearing twice. The letterhead is from Robert G. Ingersoll's law office.
