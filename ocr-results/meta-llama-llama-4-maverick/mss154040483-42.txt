The Woman Citizen
Your Investments
By Eleanor Kerr

TO policies issued by insurance companies which are very popular and which are more or less on the endowment order mentioned in our last article, are income bonds and retirement annuities.

Many women—and men, too, of course—who have no one dependent on them and wish to provide themselves with savings from which to receive an income in the future, find the purchase of income bonds one of the safest methods of assuring this. The purchaser makes annual payments until a certain age, after which date the insurance company pays her a fixed amount monthly for the rest of her life.  Should she die before reaching this age, the insurance company usually agrees to return to the heirs the total amount of deposits which have been made.  And even if the purchaser dies after having reached the stipulated age and received some of the income payments, but not all, the aggregate equal to the entire amount deposited as premiums, the difference is usually returned to the heirs.

The cost of income bonds varies greatly, according to the age at which payment on them begins, and the age at which the income is desired. A person thirty years of age, who wishes to receive ten dollars monthly beginning at the age of sixty, would pay an annual premium of about $34.14, and the same amount for each additional ten dollars of income desired. Should she wish fifty dollars to begin at the age of fifty, the annual premium would be about $82.36.  Disregarding the fact that no interest is paid until the end of twenty or thirty years, the interest received after that period amounts to a little over 7 per cent. on the accumulated deposits in the latter case, and approximately 11½ per cent. in the former case. The profit to the insurance company, of course, lies in the fact that interest accumulating during the twenty or thirty year periods is not paid out, but goes into the company's treasury.  From a business man's point of view this makes the interest received on the money in the form of income after the full facts are laid out for the world's inspection, government out of fifty or sixty represent only about one-half the interest rate indicated above, as during this time the capital has had a chance to increase 50 per cent. to 100 per cent.  The compensation for that lower return lies in protection against making a bad investment and in the guarantee of systematic saving.

The retirement annuity bond operates on the same principle and is practically the same thing, though differently named. The premium unit for women is $105 a year.  This would provide for a woman of thirty a retirement annuity of $13.50 a month for life beginning at the age of fifty, and of $30.71 a
