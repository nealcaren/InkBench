Dear Frederick Douglass

When we first saw your appointment to Haiti - and alas has many kind and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you going to clip and stick 'em with the intention of sending them all on to you - I cut "lots" of them.  but alas! in the here piles of Editorial scraps they here all disappeared but three I enclose.

It was pleasant to see the appreciation in which you are held, while we are alive to see it. 
I am not sure but we are glad
to have you here - We need you here.
