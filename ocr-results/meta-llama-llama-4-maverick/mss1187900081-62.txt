Dear Sir:-

Inclosed I send to you for
verification or denial, headed
of your Card address, and friends
on this place, should read the inclosed
with much surprise and sorrow,
We have been inclined to believe that
both New York, and a Indiana
Crowd be lured upon to
Cast their electoral vote for our
Galaouch Standard bearer. Because
Any Morton, of Kansas, Either
Confirming or denying the enclosed,
will greatly oblige
