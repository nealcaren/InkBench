609-F St. N.W.

Mr. B.F. Leighton,
Dear Sir.

Yours of the 6th inst. was duly received, the contents of which was care-fully noted by Mr. Lewis Douglass.

In reply, he desires me to say that he has no disposition whatever to make any change regarding a store step on the premises referred to in your letter.

On the contrary, he desires Mr. Lewis Douglass' attention called to the fact that said premises is in immediate need of improvement both in and out, the walks, the broken blinds, etc., and especially the sanitary apartments make it almost unbearable.  It is badly in need of a coat of paint, which, in its conspicuous position, makes a most detestable appearance. It is the only residence in that immediate neighbourhood that stands as a disgrace to-the Landlord-

Respectfully yours,
Joseph Douglass
