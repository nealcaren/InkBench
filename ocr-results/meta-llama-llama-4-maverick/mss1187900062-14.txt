ALBERT H. WALKER,
COUNSELOR AT LAW,
(Including Patent Causes.)

Hartford, Connecticut,
Jany 31st 1863.

The abolition of slavery is the 
prohibition of lawlessness.  The extension of

not also furnishing the law, the 
authoratized and vested exclu-
sion of colored rights I maintain it 
will look rather childish.  I-
will End of show that the colored 
people can more soon the show 
than for the allotment citizenship.
