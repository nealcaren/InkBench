ROSWELL, Ga., October 20.--President Roosevelt today carried out his long-cher- 
ished plan of visiting the home of his
mother--Roswell, Ga.  One of his reasons
for coming south was tha[??]




Reception at Atlanta.

ATLANTA, Ga., October 20.--The day 
broke clear, but soon after sunrise heavy 
clouds overcast the sky, presaging rain and 
ceiving much anxiety.  The program 
arranged for President Roosevelt's visit 
might have been spoiled by the threatening 
weather, but it was not.  The thousands 
of residents of Atlanta were multiplied by 
th[e??] of sightseers from the surrounding
etc., escorting states, who arrived 
everywhere along the line of the parade 
from the terminal station to the reviewing 
stand, where the State Fair Association 
was holding its annual exhibition, decora- 
tions were plentiful.  The national colors 
were floated from every building along the 
way; business houses closed to the homes of At- 
lanta's citizens lining Peachtree street. 
Pictures of the President were seen on 
every side, many bearing mottoes of praise 
and commendation to the city's distin- 
guished guest.

The route of the parade was about three 
miles long.  The presidential train rolled 
in to the terminal station ex[??] it was being coming through the 
yards welcome.  Waiting on the 
platform were the reception committee, 
headed by Governor Terrell, Senator S. A. 
Cay, Congressman Livingston, Senator A. 
Woo[d??] and Bishop C. K. Nelson.  To 
greet Mrs. Roosevelt was a small commit- 
tee of ladies led by Mrs. Terrell, wife of the 
governor; and Mrs. Clark Howell.  Gov- 
ernor Heyward of South Carolina, a guest 
of Governor Terrell, was made an honor- 
ary member of the reception committee. 
As the train came to a stop Gov. Terrell 
and Senator Clay, accompanied by Mrs. Ter- 
rell and Mrs. Howell, entered the 
dent's car to welcome the distinguished 
guests and introductions followed.  The 
original plan to have the President pass the 
waiting crowds in the station had been 
changed, and the party was taken to 
the street level by a baggage elevator and 
entered street carriages back of the station. 
Mrs. Roosevelt and her escort were 
most immediately for the governor's man- 
sion, on Peachtree street, where they were 
greeted by a reception committee of about 
100 society ladies and witnessed the parade 
from that point of vantage.

The line of march was quickly formed and 
the President and his escort started for 
Piedmont Park. The marching order was 
as follows:

The Line of March.
Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th United 
States-Infantry, acting as marshal of the 
day; platoon of mounted police; troop of the 
12th Cavalry from Fort Mc- 
Pherson, Ga., and staff.

Seventeenth Infantry Band, 5th Regiment 
Georgia state militia; band, Firemen's 
Drum and Bugle Corps of Atlanta, provi- 
sional regiment consisting of cadets from 
the Georgia Military Academy, Gordon In- 
stitute and artist Corps; Governor 
Horse Guards and other military organiza- 
tions.

The route of the parade was Mitchell 
street to Whitehall street to Peachtree, 
thence to Piedmont Park.

At the Fair Grounds.
The President arrived at Piedmont Park 
at 11:10 o'clock.  The steam whistles of the 
state fair, blew an enthusiastic welcome 
and the throngs assembled shouted them- 
selves hoarse  the President entered the 
grounds.  A review of the military es- 
cort was held, headed by the 17th Infan- 
try, which returned a few weeks ago from 
the Philippines.

From a stand erected facing the grand 
stand of the race course the President 
delivered his address.  Dudley Hughes, 
president of the fair association, at whose 
invitation the President was in turn pre- 
sented Mayor Woodward to welcome the 
President and he was followed by Senator 
Gov. Terrell, who introduced the President's 
efforts for international peace were re- 
ceived with rousing cheers.  Mayor Wood- 
ward presented the President with a block 
of Georgia marble, a memento from Geor- 
gia's organized labor, prepared by union la- 
bor.

As the President arose to speak he was 
greeted by the immense throng rising and 
cheering.

will be found in another column of The 
Star today.)
