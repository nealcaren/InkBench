My dear Sir, 
I am up of the returning
by my way here your speech, though I
heard you with pleasure declining it. I
had made inquiries with it as credit,
last night I read it my father, he
has much pleased my sister & one
in Pennsylvania of V[ill]e, he declared
delighted throughout the country, still
do feel glad,--
