Dear Miss Blackwell,â€”

I am pleased with a propensity to be always at something. You are something; still you will not draw an illogical conclusion, as three successive spirits might tempt a less reasonable creature to do.

The truth is, its hot, hot beyond creed, to say nothing of deed. What resource else was left but you. The other evening, so or so we are spoken of to me as having done this and that as nurse in The war, I was called on to admire her. I had to say, yes, I admire what she did. But must she not be a noble woman to do so much. Then I said it's my will for you and she & me, to some good. I took to the only recommendation we can have; & I look to see one who does neither recommend him. Seeing one thinks not how much he has done & can do, but how much he is,

I perceived I was talking Greek, but you are friends, & you do understand 
if Greek is did really so unintelligible?
