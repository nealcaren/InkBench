Mooney and Billings

there at 1:50 P.M. That was my recollection of the time, and I was and am very sure that was the time I saw the suitcase placed there.

About a week before the trial of Thomas J. Mooney, Assistant District Attorney Ed. Cunha said to me, "You had better make the set at 1:30 instead of 1:50." "You see, if the suitcase was set at 1:30 that would give them time to get back up Mission Street, on top of the Eilers Building," which was about a mile away from the place of the explosion.

Before the trial of Tom Mooney, Fickert told me that Cunha was going to try the case, and that I should go through with Cunha, and subsequent revelations damned every witness who testified before me against them as perjurors or mistaken. Estelle Smith has admitted her testimony was false. The Edeaus were completely discredited. Oxman is completely out of the case, as a perjurer who also tried to suborn perjury in another witness. John McDonald has since sworn to an affidavit that he knew nothing about the crime. The transcript evidence, upon which Mooney and Billings were convicted, no longer exists.

Mooney and Billings

Judge Griffin's Appeal to the Governor

San Francisco, Calif., November 14, 1928

Hon. C. C. Young, Governor of California,
Sacramento, California

My Dear Governor—When you discussed the Mooney case some weeks ago with a group of citizens at Berkeley, you told us that until the Preparedness Day crime. Some days afterwards, when you sent a message to the State Federation of Labor at Sacramento, you said again that you believed them guilty.

I believe that you are as anxious as any other citizen of California to see justice done to these two men, and will give serious attention to the documents on behalf of their pardon. Because I believe that, before you make your final decision to believe that Mooney and Billings really committed the crime for which they were tried and convicted and are now in prison.

The thing that happened on Preparedness Day twelve years ago was a terrible crime, but I am sure that you will also consider it a terrible crime to keep in prison two human beings who were most unfairly, even criminally, convicted—and that you will wish to give those who believe there has been a miscarriage of justice every opportunity to meet any doubt of their innocence that you may have.

Any fair-minded man who reads only the transcripts of the trials of Mooney and Billings would believe them guilty. If the testimony in these cases was honest and true then their guilt was conclusive. But subsequent revelations damned every witness who testified before me against them as perjurors or mistaken. Estelle Smith has admitted her testimony was false. The Edeaus were completely discredited. Oxman is completely out of the case, as a perjurer who also tried to suborn perjury in another witness. John McDonald has since sworn to an affidavit that he knew nothing about the crime. The transcript evidence, upon which Mooney and Billings were convicted, no longer exists.

And because it does not exist, the trial judge (myself), the fore-
