Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note about Mrs. Blatchford go unanswered, even tho' it was to check something I must be omitted.

I have always admired Mrs. Blatchford, and, in late years, have loved her especially. Her always beautiful Christ-like manner and tender message, and her matchless spiritual grace are such lonely additions to the great background of her life work,
 
it wrings my heart to know that she, too, is facing a financial vacuum. There are so many who'd be of help to her myself, or someone I would share in making the fund which you and ran 'tip. Being a stammering artist is a most painful handicap, in every way, but in in particularly hand to endure, what appears like the come.

Thank you for including me as one of her friends, - which I most heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett.
