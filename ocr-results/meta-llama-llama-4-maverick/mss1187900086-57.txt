wroads upon his health and constitution, 
and that he must either take rest, or 
would take him. For his, and other reasons 
knowing that a personal interview with him

lying so quietly in the dip 
of his Cabinet, that I have been unable 
to see him since Mr. Blaine left. It is understood here that no Consular 
appointments will now be made in his 
absence of di[re]ctly Blaine, hence our progress
