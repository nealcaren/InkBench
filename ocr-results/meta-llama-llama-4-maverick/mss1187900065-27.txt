THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
FOR THE
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Headquarters, Fourth Avenue cor. 22nd Street.
New York January 26 1885

To The Probate Judge of Audrain County, Mo.

Sir I enclose herewith the Last Will and Testament of Miss Ottilia arising, who died, as I am informed in the City of Paris, France August 21st 1884.  I have decided not to open the same for probate, because I do not propose to qualify as Executor; but, in view of the fact of other person having interests in the estate under the Will in question, I deem it my duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to pron administering an application for ad-ministration on the estate, with the Will annexed.

Pray to state, however, that it is the intention of The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, on the terms mentioned in the Will, to claim the property to which it's entitled.

I have the honor to remain,
with perfect respect

Henry Bergh
President.
