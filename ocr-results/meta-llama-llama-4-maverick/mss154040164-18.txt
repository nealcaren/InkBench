My dear Seady:
I do not think I could
possibly convey by you every great
pleased and satisfaction, your busy
graphic letter gave me. I read
all that you told me and you told it
clearly that it was like a conversation
with you.

The Christina card came and was
being up on the foot of my bed for a long
time. They tell us that travellers
in the tropics must have gooddiarrhea
but I thought myself quite immune
as I had not had such a thing
for thirty years, but I got one nevertheless
and was in bed a week. All our house
had a turn at it, but we fortunately
did it London fashion. I did also
get good by ease in Southampton
and wreaking aid acknowledge it by
