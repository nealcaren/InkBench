he coughed and was very
near death, when a note
to him, for Bigge, our 
dentist there, said 
he could clear and 
Just one arot of
turpentine on his navel.
The he cough stopped
and he is upf and about to-day-
The doctor had
tried every thing without
avail, and at this cow-
not hardly harm him
I thought you might try
it for your husband!
We have too few men 
of the caliber of Judge
Terrell, to lose them, if 
anything can be done to
save them and I trust
by the time this reaches
you, you will not need
this or any other remedy
that your husband will
be well on the road to
recovery.
