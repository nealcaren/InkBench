Francis Addington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 Years of age dictates the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument Inauguration
"Father Abraham's monument"
This Monument would seem to say
that Lincoln's dead, but tis not so.
In vain the apassing arm to stay
In vain her blood War made to flow.
In vain the wit' attempt to kill
In all our hearts he's living still.
And while a chap of patriot blood
Shall flow in any human frame,
It will thrill at Memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln Name.
This Monument we raise to thee
Great Child! Whom Mandonetta molded for
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
For thee, our true and constant friend.
2709

"Adieu to America Personified"
The world is gazing on thee.
Dispose Thy robes with Care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy Golden hair.
