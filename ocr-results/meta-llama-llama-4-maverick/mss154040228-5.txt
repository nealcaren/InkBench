Dictated

My Dear Mrs. Catt:

I am in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, after being present with a fractured leg.  I have been here 8 weeks today.  I hope soon to be released from this terrible home of torture, as that I can return to my little apartment at 609 Pineview Ave., Pasadena Calif.  Many friends are wonderful to me in every way.

Address my close friend Mrs. Lois Fankhauser, 1918 Oak St., So Pasadena - who has offered to care for me in exchange.

Cordially
Henrietta G. Moore
