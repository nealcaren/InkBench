THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.

Some Iowa newspapers carry the 
enormous impression that the special 
law enforcement agents appointed by the 
attorney general are to be controlled by the 
governor.  If Iowa should elect a 
"liberal" governor he probably would 
use these "special agents."  Signs 
given to a military establishment but 
a blind congress would not listen to 
them.  The Tribune quotes a num-
ber of familiar passages from Wash-
ington to the effect that when they 
jump to the con-
clusion that we are waging a war, 
but going to Alex-
ander Hamilton's men have 
written to show the 
fathers of the country 
that had they wreaked 
their schemes upon the 
military purpose they 
ought to be 
built in this new land 
free from the follies and blunders 
of the past but will not go to the 
temap to humanity, but will go to 
war, as those of the most ancient 
peoples down to the termination of 
the war of 1815, that standing armies 
or paid troops, under the sole con-
 
in the first line that he is "an Amer-
ican citizen," in the next eulogizes
England, and in the last subscribes
himself in lieu of his name," "A Glad-
stonian Liberal."  Evidently he used
this expression to conceal his Ger-
man antecedents. What would he think
of the state of his (hayden had he
signed himself "A Follower of Bismarck"?

Third in this column is a letter 
entitled "Mawkinism America."  Its
author declares that this country is
"hysterically feminine and neurotic,"
and he signs himself "Angellus."  His
hyphen is evidently severely in-
flamed.

Immediately following is the criti-
cism and indictment of Mr. James Pokan-
zeck, and every man may protect him-
self in the private right to bear arms in
order that at no late date might a 
mistaken congress or maintain 
a regular army to overturn our popu-
lar liberties.

And the column winds up with 
an article on the "mongrel popula-
tion" of the United States.

"Bah! My country, tis of thee,"
 said James McPherson,
"Treason, N. J."

Just suppose that name had been 
Wilhelm Latscheck?

All of these letters appeared in 
one column of the New York Tri-
bune, and they appeared 
sequentially.  Not one of has been omit-
ted.  Shall we continue to think of 
the hyphen symbol in Teutonic terms?

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.

The Register recently asked of the 
Chicago Tribune a list of the men who 
and Hamilton and the constitution 
makers met the situation and give 
this country and army and a navy at 
the start.*

And Madison in his message to 
congress in that year, referring to a 
refusal of some of the states to fur-
nish her quota, says: "It is known 
that some congressmen have 
given their constituents to under-
stand that a military establishment 
ought to be rejected as 
in the private right to bear arms 
in order that at no late date might a 
mistaken congress or maintain 
a regular army to overturn our popu-
lar liberties."

sen the call for military establish-
ments, but if circumstances should 
at any time oblige the government 
to form an army of any magnitude, 
that army can never be formidable to 
the liberties of the people, where there 
is a large body of citizens, little if 
at all inferior to them in discipline 
and the use of arms."

The constitution was accepted on 
this presentation by-Hamilton, but 
the fathers were not wholly satisfied

the American bill of rights, the 
militia was officially recognized as 
the military defense of the new na-
tion.

IN A SECOND SPEECH.

Mr. Irish- I was requested by the 
gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Ball) 
to reply to certain portions of his 
seripture.  They are the Corinthians, 
fourteenth thirty-fourth and 
to Timothy, eleventh and twelfth 
verses.  If we are obedient to 
move an amendment to those would 
passages.  (Laughter).  But as that is 
explanation, that Paul was then 
writing to the Corinthian women-I 
do not know what sort they were.  They 
were women, we are told, who did 
speak in public, and it might have 
been proper that Paul should exhort 
them to silence and subjection.  He 
said nothing of the American women, 
that they should keep silence at the 
inspiration but it is singular that 
nowhere in the writing of his divine 
master and not 
refined, womanly-qualities, 
Jesus, in the most explicit 
language of all his sayings, in his sermon 
on the mount, and 
cited men to deeds of charity, to be mer-
ciful, and humble that they may be 
honored.  It teaches men and women 
alike endure trial and suffer judgment 
and arise at the resurrection.  As 
they are to travel side by spirit-
ual companionship I avow 
that we should place women in a temporary 
position of disadvantage, where their 
aspirations are never to be real-
ized.  I say walk in the better 
spirit of the scripture.  We are obeying the 
Paul or any other apostle, who was 
so unfortunate as to live and die a 
bachelor.  It is better to refer to the 
writings of the divine master and not 
to the teachings of one who was a 
little bit beadstrong and pedantic in 
his views on some subjects.

subject of side of "I
