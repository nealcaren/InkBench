"The Governor means right," said Mrs. Howe.  "He means that, in view of the legitimacy and injustice of the inhibition necessitated by the law, the women may very well have abstained from voting."

"Do you agree with the Governor in his implication that woman suffrage may prove to be an unfortunate experiment?" 

"The point that I should make," replied Mrs. Howe, "is that the male portion of the community has the right to determine whether it is or is not.  We do not concede to make the decision.  There are some who do not admit that universal - male - suffrage is good, but such are not allowed to limit the suffrage.  Suffrage does not belong to men to give or to take away.  It is a masculine form of law men must give it to us.  I do not allow that the obligation to give it, even though it shall be an unpopular experiment."

"How do you view the Governor's proposal to have women decide for or by the men themselves?"

"It is a very delicate matter to speak of, but I will say that I think it a matter of such evident and positive right that should be submitted to the chance of a popular vote."

"What would be the effect be, do you think, of such a vote?"

"Not now you see that, if we settle the question in that manner, and it turns out in our favor, we can do nothing more in the way of argument, and, if it goes against us, nothings is settled.  Anything within their power is loosened to-day as off I don't think it should consult

TO THE CHANCE OF A POPULAR VOTE."

"How would the majority of the women vote on this question were it so submitted to them?"

"I should feel very uncertain that, at first, women of farms and from the country would go against it, and, while I do not wish to do the poorer classes any injustice, I fear that a great many of them would be influenced.  There are also a good many young women in easy circumstances who would fear to displease their husbands, lovers, and fathers.  It is nearly all women graduates of colleges, and all professional women who vote 'yes'."

"Do you view the Governor's plan of post-office voting?"

"The experiment of voting for school officers places developped nothing which rendered it unpleasant or improper for a woman to go there and cast her ballot.  In view of the falsification, women should vote as men do."

"What do you aim for particularly in the immediacies (latter?) of the suffrage?"

"We should always strike for municipal suffrage, which thing is far more to us.  We must never forget that a moment ago all that we mean by suffrage, we must advance in every practical, safe form, at every opportunity."

"What, in your judgment is the outlook?"

"The rapid rise in the culture of women and particularly the great increases of the study of sociological and economic questions, are an carrying society in the direction of what individuals may do or think."
