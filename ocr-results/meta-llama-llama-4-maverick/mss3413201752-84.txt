APOLOGY

A grandson reminded us that if we prepared a Quiz on only one book of the Bible yearly, if we were to complete our task we must live until we were 145 years old.

So we planned to hasten and put into one booklet the questions on Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

We were encouraged by kind words from friends like Mrs. Wendell Green who called our last, with story attached, "a carefully documented outline of an ancient story, in which social, economic, legal and religious problems are etched against a romantic background with an undertone of humor and with an over-tone of challenging implication."

When the Quiz on the last three books of the Pentateuch was ready for printing, tho much was omitted that belongs to Church ritual and to criminal law often mentioned in current literature, it did seem long.

So the story of the Daughters of Zelophehad gathers up only some of the ethical teachings of the Great Law-giver.  If you underline accurate citations from the Bible with a true-blue pencil and make no error, you will receive "Honorable Mention."

We admit that the names of the husbands of the Daughters, Akor, Bekar, Cekar, Dekar and Ekar are not given in the Bible nor does the Bible tell us of the various conversations of the Daughters, as noted in this Dialogue.  But why should not the girls have talked about the great Jewish Lawgiver, about their family property and their future husbands?

Their marriages remind us of our own fifty-four years ago because ours was different.  We were not honored by the presence of Moses and Eleazar, but the knot was thoroughly tied by that modern prophet, Rev. Anna Howard Shaw.

Here is another difference.  Moses said that the Daughters could choose their own husbands while in our case, the man did the choosing and the woman followed the example of the many men of Manasseh and was "willing."

Scene I

Milcah.  This tent is the only home we ever knew, and how we do miss father.

Tirzah.  More than you missed mother?

Hoglah.  Oh no, but you two were too young to remember her.  Father made a pet of you, Tirzah, and was so proud when you had learned all the Ten Commandments.

Noah.  We older daughters were taught largely by our parents but Mahlah has been a real mother and teacher of you girls, Milcah and Tirzah.  Mother used to say that if the first child were younger of you younger children.  You, Mother used to say it fair for you to faithfully trained all of us.  If ever we are sinful or ignorant, you can not be blamed, and you can wash your hands over the head of a heifer.

Mahlah.  Our parents were happy that you girls not only remembered the Decalogue but many other teachings of Moses, our great law-giver.  We were not taught much that Moses
