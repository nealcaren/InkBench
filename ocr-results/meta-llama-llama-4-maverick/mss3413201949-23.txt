(1) The Senseless Waste of War

When the great war began $7 billions of gold wandered
stood worth the Europe.  The total coin money
+ bullion in circulation in the whole world was apt
eleven billions dollars.  At the nations plunged
all well into the war, borrowing all they cold
printing paper money.  + not stopping to count the
cost.  At the end the international debt was so
cumbrous + burdensome that a universal panic
followed.  What senseless waste!  and wonder they
can not pay their debts too?

Do you know that every man killed in the late
War cost the living $1800?

Let me read you a little dialogue, an extract from
a conversation between a king and his prime minister,
in the 3rd century before Christ related.   Ammianus Byrnes 
Read from Bryan at the Conference

2 Was we the people So Will
When the generation that has not experienced
war ceases to be heard spread in the glories of war
but know the facts + refuse to repeat such
history - when women refuse the glamor
war trappings, war music, war propaganda
+ take intelligent stand in elections.
