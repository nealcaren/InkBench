Following the example of all elders I want to give one bit of advice, and I want to leave with you one fact which I have learned as the result of my life's experience.  I do not expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may remember the fact.  The advice is that when you go forth from the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from indigestion; nor is it the idle fantasy of a disordered mind, although these charges have both been made!

Each of you young people, as you enter into the world's work and into the world's life, will be called upon to be useful, to have a special bent, to be a power for some good in the world.  I would not ask you to be reformers - that means giving way to enthusiasms, and running the risk of becoming faddists - and all I am asking you is this: wherever you go, take your convictions with you at the time.

There is a law of evolution - you have learned much of that during your life in college, know that Some - as they regard it as during their life - ask you to be evolver's - men and women of vision who are willing to live and to die for their cause.  So I ask you to take into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions of those who do not agree with you, to be guided by the truth in things.  Make the large things look large and the little thing small.  The greatest pleasure in getting at the truth is to learn how to knock off from a proposition all the detail which has nothing to do with the proposition.  Then you have learned that one lesson in life you will travel the line of your convictions five hundred times as fast.

You, the sons and daughters of Wyoming, you have the immortal example of your state to follow.  Then, fifty-two years ago, the young territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone - alone in all the world.  In 1869 I was a young child studying geography, and I remember my map with that great yellow splotch Desert.  The granting of votes to women in some unknown state in that great desert had little influence on the outside world.  What good thing could come out of a desert?  But time brought influence to Wyoming, and then the world jeered at her.  I am sure there must have been men who went as delegates to political conventions and as delegates to Congress who had been loudly to defend the statute of the state.  To my mind it was a wonderful thing that Wyoming took its stand, - but there was not one folk compared with the fact that she never failed to stand fast.  I do not know in all those years of a single instance when she faltered.  The world jeered, and still she stood.  I remember long years ago, for an example, when she appeared in the City of Boston.  A man who was interviewed by the Boston Herald, always an opposer of woman's suffrage, said The paper quoted him, "the Honorable Mr. S- and-So from Cheyenne, Wyoming, declaring woman suffrage a failure".  The article said that in Wyoming, although the women had the vote, they never used it; that in Wyoming, there were such quarrels in the family because the women voted that there was no peace or harmony; and so on.  It appeared in the morning press.  Boston was very smug in those days -- There were few who dreamed proposition all the detail which has nothing to do ith the proposition.  Then you have learned that one lesson in life you will travel the line of your convictions five hundred times as fast.
