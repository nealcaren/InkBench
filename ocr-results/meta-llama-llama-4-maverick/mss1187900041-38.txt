W.G.Kelly has my application for a clerkship in the Treasury in hand and both Levi and Joel are doing my chances for a position by the first of next month very good.  Judge Kelly has renderences as I heard either of them would get Seig Randolph to recommend me and if the clerkship provided I will do some extra writing for the Judge out of office hours.  So at her own expense to take care of little one of course I have consented to do so, and during herickness.  I would have to my appointment is only a question of pay, a mere here to a week, I spent little time.   Senator Bucking gave me a very flattering recommendation, as also did  pay for pony Jersey, garden tools, seed Senator Pomeroy, Hon. Sec.W.Julian and & and a new elveh which cost me $25 with Osak Davis men from our dist. who all the furniture, gave me a letter of introduction to Mr San titled & gives of these gentlemen to work.  I could borrow the money here, but as I have not had that to do this for I dislike to ask anybody here to loan me money.  I owe you now, and to secure your loan
