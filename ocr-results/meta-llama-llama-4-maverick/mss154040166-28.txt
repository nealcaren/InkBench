The 18 signed checks have arrived C.E.  I have my eye on the mortgage falling due "on the old home".  There are dramatic possibilities if we only had a good villain in the background who gives you the alternative between foreclosure and marriage, the while he walks down-stage and bows "I'll break you
yet my proud beauty"!  I shall of course keep you advised on this matter.

Miss Hay forwarded under date of November 15th a cable from "Ian MacMillan addressed to you:-
"Cable from London signed MacMillan outranks Spanish invitation received send your cable to convention in time for December Jus.  Also send immediate draft circular letter appealing for funds for convention"

This I followed by a telegram of my own summarizing the returns on the vote as below:-
"Six officers vote yes stop no returns from Central Powers stop England Prominent Brookden vote yes (Stops) Switzerland agrees if majority affiliated societies favor stop Switzerland strongly objects on ground  of limited attendance & passport difficulties Congress in some neutral country followed by special meeting in Madrid for all who can get passport.  As ending full report foreign correspondence to San Francisco."

Several of the voting slips include comments as follows:-
Schlumberger an officer and president:-
"Yes very willingly in principle.  There should be, notwithstanding, a meeting before the Board of officers for which we have already voted."

Margaret- "I think this is the best proposal that has been made so far. It appeals to me tremendously,although I am not blind to the drawbacks,especially the increase in the traveling expenses which will be felt very heavily by people living in this part of the world."

Switzerland- "If the majority of the associations affiliated to the Alliance pronounce for Espin we yield. But we would very much prefer a meeting in Switzerland. Our country is incredibly backward in the matter of woman suffrage,and we are precisely at the psychological moment when a great effort should be made. And as with us,all is the masculine electors and not parliaments, who must recognize out rights,nothing would have so much weight on public opinion as having a Congress"
