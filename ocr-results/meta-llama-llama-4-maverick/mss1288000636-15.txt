Nempa back on the farms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets. During recent months it has become apparent that state control in markets where out-of-state milk is imported in volume was not enough.

Despite the fact that efficient operation of federal and state control agencies, working in cooperation, is likely to lessen somewhat the need for producer associations, there should be no worry lest the control agencies would put the cooperatives out of business. Control administators have publicly stated that farmer associations were essential for the smooth operation of the dairy industry.

It now appears that the revised Boston milk marketing agreement, being written under AAA auspices, may never reach a final, acceptable form. The various parties to the writing of the agreement seem determined that they shall not be forced to concede an inch. In view of the fact that Administrator Samuel W. Tator has reminded New England that the agreement is purely voluntary and that he will eventually tire in its efforts to secure the agreement, such tactics are foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow

Seven Germans were sentenced to the day other for listening to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two of them having their sentences lengthened to four years for the additional offense of discussing politics while the broadcast was going on.

To most people who have ever happened to "pick up Moscow" this will seem a high price to pay for either the instruction or the entertainment offered. But the same would be true of broadcasts from Berlin or Rome whenever these de-sert Mozart and Verdi for the arid wastes of propaganda.

Whether Russians are being sent to jail for tuning in on the fuehrer, or the duce, has not been reported, but it is hard to imagine any government being put in danger by the dreary stuff that is being broadcast in prodigious quantities for consumption abroad. It would save all the dictators much trouble simply to let the broadcasts cancel out, assuming, for example, that Russian broadcasts do no more damage in Germany than German broadcasts are doing in Russia.

To admit, by police action, that this is not the case seems like a tacit admission of inferiority in this kind of warfare. If Dr Goebbels has not yet managed to bring the radio armament of Germany up to the Russian level of efficiency it is time for a shakeup in the ministry of propaganda.

American and French Bombing Planes

The description of 24 French bombing planes now being hurried to completion near Paris and claimed to be the biggest of their type in the world, invites comparison with the United States army's Boeing bomber recently destroyed at Dayton, O. With a wing spread of 108 feet the French planes apparently justify, by a small margin, the claim as to size. 232-miles-an-hour average which the Boeing plane maintained for the nonstop flight from Seattle to Dayton makes the French planes seem laggards, 12 being designed for a maximum of 180 miles and 12 for a maximum of 208 miles.

The apparent superiority of the American plane is still greater in view of the accepted understanding that its Seattle-Dayton flight was made with only three-quarters of its full power and that its maximum with four 800 horse-power motors, intended eventually to be replaced, and efforts are being made to bring it from now on.

While one finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the New Haven ex-mayor that it is more a part of a national conspiracy for Gov Cross to fail to mention the Roosevelt administration than it would have been for him to praise it, the gov-ernor did praise it two years ago does not seem to lend some significance to his failure to mention it now. In 1933, the governor, formerly dean of the Yale graduate school and veteran professor of English literature, found his soul stirred, when present speaking to a mass meeting or New Haven's Republican mayor, to this glowing passage:-

Over the horizon and the hills the sun has appeared, the eternal symbol of hope and life. We are quickened with a new faith and courage in a new deal. Thence forward the smiling, hopeful days of President Roosevelt leadership will bring us to the tents the east with gold.

The fact that the shrewd old gentleman who occupies the governor's chair down in Hartford isn't saying anything just now about "the hills and the horizon" and "the new deal" may perhaps be explained on other grounds than those supplied by New Haven's Republican ex-mayor. It may be, as some shrewdly suggest, that the Democratic mayor of New Haven, having made a good record, deserves reelection on that as the chief issue. It may also be that the Democrats, who generally suffered in the Connecticut city and town elections last go as, have found that the new deal isn't altogether their best talking point, in Connecticut. And it may be that "Uncle Toby," as his intimate admirers still call Gov Cross, having been quoted during the summer as making occasional remarks which indicated about the same affection for the new deal as has been shown by its economics as has been shown by Gov-Ely, doesn't see the new deal quite as he did in 1933 and just doesn't want to talk about it any-ex-cept in a very general way.  Perhaps his silence can be explained in three ways.

An American mining engineer who lately visited Eritrea says that he has found there "a boom such as America experienced years ago on the mining frontiers in the West."  Why not, with a big army using it as a base?  But a mining boom is based on gold dug from the ground, not on wealth dug from the pockets of other taxpayers back home.

Shortwave amateurs had a wonderful time telling each other about the earthquake.  Ordinarily their chats are limited to comparing notes on the weather in different parts of the country, and an exciting event at midnight of which the sleeping world has not yet been told keeps the air full of chatter for hours.

It is suggested in a dispatch from business men may in time lead the government to lay an embargo on trade with Italy. If there is to be an embargo that is not a very inspiring kind of suasion in its behalf.

Italy sympathizes with the British in the nonstop flight from Seattle to Dayton makes the French planes seem laggards, 12 being designed for a maximum of 180 miles and 12 for a maximum of 208 miles.

Montana may or may not be cheered by being told that its earthquakes are but the growing pains of its mountains. For all practical purposes its mountains are already high enough.

FROM A FORMER RESIDENT

To the Editor of The Republican:-

Very few cities have the natural advantages which the City of Homes has—geographically situated to be a key city for that section as a manufacturing and distributing point, beautifully situated on the outskirts of the cut and within easy access to the salt water and various large eastern cities.

To add these the superb school system, and other features, Kansas City should stand out among the important centers of the nation.

It would seem with a united effort on the part of the various civic organizations, the city, people, including numerous other advantages, could be told to millions, through the medium of its newspapers, radio, etc.

Impossible Combination

To the Editor of The Republican:-

If the subject were not so tragic, one might be amused at the futile and almost frantic efforts and appeals which are constantly being made in the attempt to reduce the number of automobile fatalities.

To continue to produce faster and more powerful cars, knowing full well that the greater the power and speed, the more difficult are they to control in an emergency. We explore that these men of our mental or moral balance is not up to the safe operation of these machines, yet we provide them nearly all who apply.

Some exponents of a variant economic interpretation of history would have us believe that the reputations enjoyed by the products of cert countries is wholly a matter of national prestige. The world must first drink of the wine of French wines.  Neither Bundy and B-deaux are superior, but because they have been generally known to come from a country which is is a losers and made France "la gar rison nation."  If the World war had ended otherwise, they say, the world would have decided that German wines were superior, and if Italy nc had joined the Allies, then the French would surely rise to the crest of the wa ers as Fascists hope, then the cheap Chianti, Orvieto, Capri and Ravel would soon be con-sidered the most comparable at holding their own in competition with the choicest vintages of California would be doing their best to copy them.

Connjeasures in wine may be left 
to dispose of this cynical slur, but no national prestige is going to be found in our theory of taste can be found in current fashions. It would be hard to trace any connection between 
increased prestige of the Soviet repulic, for example, and the matches 
that Japan is forced to export because of the vitiation of American and in a considerable line of Japanese goods, for 
blows up and down, but not quite 
down to safety matches.

Soviet matches have improved, 
even now the best to be said for th 
is that they are more likely to 
than if the box said "Made in 
America". But the best said for Japan 
matches is that their produce 
shown very great genius in discover 
ing ways by coloring their matches 
trifling cost their wares could 
be shipped to the United States as f 
cry ornamental matches with a low 
duty to pay.

That the prestige of the Sov 
has little or nothing to do with 
the masters' touch, the sculptor's 
chisal keen.

Great Master, touch us with thy skillful hand;
 Let not the music that is in us die!
 Great Sculptor, hew and polish us; nor
 let, and lost, thy form within us

 Let there be naught unfinished, broke

become

The Master’s Touch

In still air the music lies unheard;
The sculptor’s chisel hides un-
seen.

To wake the beauty that is latent 
needs 
the master’s touch, the sculptor’s 
chisal keen.

Great Master, touch us with thy skill-
ful hand;
 Let not the music that is in us die!

Boston, October 31, 1935.

To the Editor of The Republican:-

Flag waving and lip patriotism are no substitutes for the 
Constitution and Americanism.  The Americans 
of the late war are 
very fierce against a big boy who 
has religious scruples about saluting 
the flag, yet they are unpatriotically 
demanding their bonuses before it is legally due, and at a time 
when it is highly inconvenient to the country to pay it.  C. M. G.
