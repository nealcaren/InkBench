supper we all went to the Sands
to skate and skate but it was
eight o'clock I came on 'pon
I'm sitting down at last!  When
we left home this afternoon
one for all - brings my spoke
with me anxiously [?] I wish that you would have them
read with my best regards.  Emma
Cut the last two Islands
bedtime and we must be up
at five o'clock Johnson will
hear from home in a while
and you shall hear from me
I know this is not as good
looking as you are used
but I am in' head to good
right

Yours from afar
Ann Charles B. Douglass
