Washington A.C.
July 15.1883.

Dear Grandpa,

We received
Your affectionate letter on the
12. th and we were very glad
to hear from you, and I know
that you are getting along
nicely!
Every thing is passing along
smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times most intolerable.  It is now
about nine o clock and the
thermometer stands at - 84Â½.
Charlie has not left yet-
for the Eastern Shore, and
I doubt whether he will or
not; I think the latter as
I don't hear himsay anything.
