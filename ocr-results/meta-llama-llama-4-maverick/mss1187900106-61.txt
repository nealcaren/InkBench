JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Libe'ria, a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1820 by the American Colonization Society (see Colonization Soc.), and established as an independent state in 1847, is between 4° 20' and 7° 20' N. lat., and stretches along the Atlantic from the Sherboro River on the N. W. to the Pedro River on.the S. E., a distance of about 600 miles, extending inland from the coast from 10 to 40 miles. Its area, which is steadily increased by purchases from the native tribes, was estimated in 1890 at 14,360 square miles. The shore is elevated and rocky in the S. E., but otherwise low, generally sandy or gravelly, seldom marshy. In the interior the country rises, swelling into forest-covered hills and lofty ranges traversed by fine valleys. Many streams flow to the ocean, but none of them is navigable for more than 20 miles from the mouth; the most important are the St. Paul, navigable for 18 miles, and having 7 feet of water at low tide on the bar at its mouth; the St. John, the Junk, and the Cape Mount River. The climate is thoroughly tropical. Of the two seasons, the dry lasts from October to June, and the wet from June to October. In the dry season the average heat is 84° F., the thermometer seldom rising above 90°; in the wet season the average heat is 76°, the thermometer never falling below 60°.  To the white man the climate is deadly—not from excessive heat, but probably from a climatic fever, reared in the negro, when born and reared in another climate, on his arrival here from the so-called African fever. The natives, on the contrary, are robust, healthy, and long-lived. The soil is generally very fertile. The principal farming districts lie along the banks of the St. Paul. Here the sugar-cane grows luxuriantly; one year's produce was estimated at 300,000 pounds. Cotton is indigenous, and yields two crops annually. Coffee of excellent quality is cultivated with success in the interior. The cereals, maize, rice, wheat, barley, and oats; the vegetables, cabbages, peas, beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.; and the fruits, oranges, guavas, tamarinds, pomegranates, pineapples, African peaches, etc., are easily raised. The forests contain teak, mahogany, rosewood, ebony, poplar, several kinds of gum trees, dyewoods, medicinal shrubs, and different varieties of useful palms, among which is the nut-bearing palm from which palm oil is made. Of minerals, the gold, hippopotamus, crocodile, leopard, etc., are now nearly exterminated. Of minerals, iron abounds, and copper is said to occur in the interior. The inhabitants numbered, according to the largest estimates, about 1,068,000, of whom about 18,000 are Americo-Liberians or the rest natives. The natives belong to different tribes: the Veys, the Mandingoes, the Mollah tribe, among whom the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U. S. has established a mission school at Totocoroh; the Pessehs, entirely pagans; the Bassas, among whom the American Baptist missionaries established a mission in 1835; the Kroos, mostly idolaters; the Mandingoes, the most gifted of the tribes under the jurisdiction of the republic; and others. The Americo-Liberians have a regular system of schools, and are progressing in all branches of civilization. Industrial processes and manufactures have been started among them, and a lively trade has sprung up between the republic and Great Britain, Belgium, and Hamburg.  Palm oil, sugar, cotton, coffee, ivory, camwood, arrowroot, etc., are exported; cotton goods, cutlery, powder, and tobacco are imported. The country is divided into four counties—Mesurado, Grand Bassa, Sinon, and Mary-land. The capital, Monrovia, is situated on Cape Mesurado, and has about 2,000 inhabitants.  Other settlements are New Georgia, Caldwell, Virgins, Edina, Greenville, Lexington, Buchanan, Millsburg, etc.  The annual revenue is about $100,000 almost exclusively derived from customs. home duties.  A public debt of $500,000 was contracted in 1871. The constitution of the republic is modelled after that of the U. S.  All citizens are born free and equal. Elections take place by ballot, and every male citizen who possesses real estate has the right of suffrage.  But no white man can be admitted to citizenship, and none but citizens can hold real estate in the republic (a temporary provision). The president is elected for two years; the senators for four; the representatives for two; the representatives for every 10,000 inhabitants.  The first president was Joseph Jenkins Roberts, who served four terms, from 1848 to 1856, and was once more elected in 1871. Hilary R. W. Johnson was elected president May, 1883.  The official language is the English.
