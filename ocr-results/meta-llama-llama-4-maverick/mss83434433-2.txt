Dear Sir

I have thought of an expediant to bring in Caro Line which I submit to you. It is the Gene
Mo Levy is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi
Runsey you could dispense with James & see Bene ole
& let him go display his negro & get it out that he 
has - or I am sure bring him for me let be out
that it is an arrangement of mine over which you have
no control. What do you think of it? Let me know

Yrs truly
