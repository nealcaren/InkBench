Instead of making Muralla
and Biskets I would try
send you a line.  I hope
you will excuse bad writing
and spelling as you will
find.  I have seen Miss
Krigers twice since you left.
Every thing is going
on just the same as I have
to say. & no news to tell
you all are well at
home hoping that
you are.  Rosa is well
and sends love to you.

Truly your friend
Louisa Sprague
