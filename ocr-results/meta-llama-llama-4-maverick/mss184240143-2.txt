My dear Mr. Stephenson,

I am afraid your business affairs are again suffering. In her not doing the part, I can in no way compel it to be done. "Hee Haw" as you said in our "Can't Keep a Hottub" I am sorry, think how I sympathized with your misfortunes if might have been now in a different position.

You lotd me you would see me about your Theatrical business & the next I hear you have "a boy (as it were) dotting your affairs & "mixing [sic] things up". I thought you had a clear experience before with Amateur managers that learned by experience the value of Management & that I am sorry you only feel slighted. I could do more for you than any man in this business or out of it for that matter & would (or will) do it cheerfully,
