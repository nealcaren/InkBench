I came to Boston on Nov. 6th
& make a short visit before winter, & 
I am still here now waiting for winter
to be gone.  I have lived very quietly, only 
been to the opera a few times.  I have 
seen none of the celebrities, they were 
too costly.  My heart is not broken, else 
not-think easily.  I thought I should
see you here this spring, because the Jeffers 
said so,  It has been a trying winter,
but Spring & violets are more the ever. 
Agnes worlds me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work will do
fine.  But- if she is shut in, she is herself
"in color studies".  shut she for studies
chapes.  She has a good-smiling mean, so 
she has raged from wh fields & things.  You've 
easy.  Love blopts you dear- always.

Lovingly - Mansae day -
