TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double

By ELEANOR ROBERTS

There are so many guest shot "swaps" on television next season that viewers will think they're seeing double.

Searching back in your memory you'll be saying, "Now, WHERE did I see Bing Crosby - on the Bob Hope show or on his own special?"

SINATRA SWAPPING 
SHOTS WITH MARTIN

Frankie Sinatra is swapping guest shots with Dean Martin on the Sinatra special. And tax boys can't take a slice off Milton Berle's not only involved in these reciprocal "mix-ups".  If these reciprocal "mix's" - he happens to be the star, that is.  All the network ward he names, a return appearance on Lucille Ball's Friday, Aug. 14, 1959 special but he's doing a swap with Lucy-Dizzy, too.

PICK OF THE WEEKEND

All-Star Football Tops Tonight

By DICK KLEINER

Smack in the middle of August, we've got our annual kick-off of the fall kick-off season, THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME (see Best Bet).  It is the cream of last week's grueling college stars meet the pro champs, in this case, the Baltimore Colts.  As usual, it should be a passing contest, with the All-Stars Lee Grosskopff and Phil Silvers show Get Your Gun" flavor has an "on the town" scent, with songs and skits that are strictly from the zanies.  This year's matching show will feature hand and half-formalities and passing out from the Giants' new "100 proof" defense.  Billy Joe "Red" Rawhide R Wadhill will get his team back on track to the victory (Ch. 7).
