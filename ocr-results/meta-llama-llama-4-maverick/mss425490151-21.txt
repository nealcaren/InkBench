Dear Voters in the Convention by Mail
of the National Woman's Party:
The report of the Elections Committee, signed by Dr. Margaret Sebree, Chair--
man, has been handed to me.A copy is enclosed heerewith.
Delegates from all over the country sent in their ballots.  Each delegate
represented twenty-five members.  All nominees proposed by the Nominating Committee
were elected.A number of other names were written in; in many cases these were of
members who had, for one reason or another, expressed their inability to serve, and
whose names had therefore not been proposed by the Nominating Committee.
It will be recalled that in addition to the newly elected Council members,
all former National Chairman and all State Chairmen are membersmembes of the National
Council ex officio.
May I, as Convention Chairman, thanks all of you for your splendid cooperation
during this, our first Convention by mail.The registration fee which manyyou
