at the Howard theatre as a segregation just as much on a separate block of seats in the Auditorium. If these singers appear in any manner before the 
inauguration it will be expressly against our orders and in open rebellion." 

There was no difference of opinion among those responsible for the pre-
sentation of "Deep River" It appeared that it was a real tragedy that 
they denied the opportunity of entertaining the vast audience gathered to hear 
them, particularly the women from foreign lands who were eager to see and lis-
ten to them.and to bid friendly to us regretted also that the race thus lost 
such a fine chance of displaying its musical ability through its talented rep-
resentatives and of proving to what a high standard of excellence it had at-
tained. But, under the circumstances the rendition of the program was impos-
sible. The members of the choir and the chorus who sang for them that 
night heard how those of their own race who had been similarly handicapped 
had overcome their depression, they said they were too depressed to sing.

Delegate to the International Peace Congress.

The following letter which was received one morning about the middle of 
December, 1918 thrilled me with surprise and joy.  "Dear Mrs. Terrell," it 
read, "It gives me real pleasure to inform you that at a meeting of the Execu-
tive Council of the Women's Peace Party, which in the section for the U.S.A. of 
the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace, held in New York City 
November 24, you were elected as one of thirty delegates and alternates to the 
International Congress of Women which it was arranged at the Hague in 1915 
should meet at the time of the Peace Conference at the end of the War."  The 
letter stated that it was likely the meeting would be held either at Paris 
or the Hague and this might be either the first week in February or early 
in May.

"We realize," the letter concluded, "that this is not an easy journey 
which we are inviting you to take under crowded conditions, in winter, to war-
torn countries.  But we sincerely hope that your love of human welfare will min-
imize the difficulties and that you will be able to go with us.  Faithfully yours 
Alice Masern Post, Secretary of Delegates from the U.S.A."  Mrs. Post was the 
Assistant 
wife of Dr. Louis Post who was then Secretary of Labor under President Woodrow 
Wilson.

I was working for the Camp Community Service at the time and was in 
the South trying to induce some of the Committeemen of the large cities to sanc-
tion the establishment of centers for colored women and girls.  After completing 
the summary of the conditions which obtained in these cities I sent it to head-
quarters and asked for a leave of absence to go as a delegate to the Peace Con-
gress which would be held in Europe.  This was granted in the following letter:

"My dear Mrs. Terrell: Thank you for the summary; it is a fine piece of work 
and the classification workers are delighted with it.  It will help us materially 
in understanding the problems of the cities you visited.  We wish to express our 
appreciation of the devoted service you have given C.C.S. through the past 
months, and willingly grant you the leave of absence to enable you to make the 
important trip abroad.  Wishing you success in your new undertaking, Very sincerely 
yours, (signed) Geo. E. Diackie, Director Field Department."
