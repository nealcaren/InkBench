AMSTERDAM - Dec 12 (Associated Press) Ten per cent of the children born in Prussia in wartime are illegitimate, according to statements made in the Prussian House of Representatives by Dr.  Engel, in reply on the subject in yesterday's session.  The Berlin Town Councillor, Dr.  Engel, stated that this large proportion is evidence of the moral healthiness of the German race. He added, in the course of an appeal for the withdrawal of all distinctions between illegitimate and legitimate children "it may seem paradoxical that this great number of illegitimate children 'repay our people'.  They afford prosperity of the families, an idea which has not yet penetrated the common masses.

"The terrible fact, however, is that children reach their ninth month year. As illegitimate children die in comparison with legitimate children. The death rate is four to one in the shops for the unemployments of the stillborn children. There should be a uniform birth certificate for all children. The fallen soldiers should be awarded the Iron Cross.

Wartime, owing to the card system, Every journey for a food card is a path of torture for the young mother cation and humiliation. In the card-giving offices she must1st and again make confession of her fault. The hero of her child will remove many obstacles and much mental torture." 

Dr.  Engel stated, has now reached a total of nearly 200,000 yearly
