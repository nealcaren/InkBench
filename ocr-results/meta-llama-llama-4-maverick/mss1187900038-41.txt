Bridport Dorsetshire
October 9-1885

My dear dear Douglas

We are at Eburne
from our three months' tour
through France Italy & Switzerland.
We spent a few days at
Woodcote, Brightholm before lying
Bridport at the beginning of this week
and here we found a
great many & welcome letters waiting
& it is always a great pleasure to
receive one of your nice letters
& this one dated May, 
was as mental full of interest
I think you will have as much
such adventures as the one
you describe at Havre
place in Baltimore I was
it was a mercy that you
coped uninjured badly
wish be so fortunate as to
be proud to
write & know you are
safely home very anxiously
