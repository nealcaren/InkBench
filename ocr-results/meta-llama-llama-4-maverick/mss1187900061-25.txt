Legation of the United States
Monrovia, Liberia
July 20th, 1883.

Honorable
R.R. Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir, Douglass:

I hereby acknowledge
the receipt of your speech delivered on the occasion of
the commemoration of Emancipation in the District of Columbia
and was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterance on
the brilliant array of powers after
an almost constant defensive
of yours for nearly a half cen-
tury in the cause of oppressed
people.
