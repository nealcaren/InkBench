Lew is to be her about
The Leaque's [?] workface?
We are meeting tomorrow
to come to a definite
conclusion about the
design in soapstone, &c
for the Memorial tablet
in Washington on which
the National House Roll
names are to be placed.
Mr. Plan is to have the 
sculptor's take place at 
the time of our Commemoration 
meeting in Washington in June. 
With gratitude - a very
cordial & loving wish 
always affectionately yours
Katharine D. Simpson
