this beautiful but far away, land separated
from all my friends and from the many
interests which have hereofare made them
a part of my life.  In here complete contrast large
life can hardly be imagined than my
surroundings here.

I think you would be sorry for my
mother were you to see her now.  Her body
lives, but her mental powers are sadly
impaired.  The care of her is overcrowded
at times, for she is in the border land
between sanity and insanity, and
cannot yet be left to & other hands than
mine.  She is quite an aged woman -
seventy five years old.

And you dad as it is, it is the commonest
ladder that the relations between us
used to be.  She has no power any more to
spoil my life, and patience is comparatively
easy, because of the pitifulness of her
present condition.

But you will wonder why I am in

and am glad to feel that they have
brought me more than they have taken
away.  I have lived over and beyond
many vain wishes, and am content to
find myself beloved and useful in a
small sphere.

My husband's brother, an able fellow
of mental calibre, hence very robust,
became a physician.  He had a brilliant
professional future before him, when caring
for mental strain and overwork, his health gave way.  He fell a victim to that
dreadful disease locomotor ataxia.
He was living in New York.  We that
bridled we were in Madison Square and
a very happy one to regard the weather,
and a very sad one to behold, as we were
feeling sadly our recent bereavement
in the sudden death of my oldest brother's
dear young wife, who had endured
herself to all our hearts in quite a
remarkable manner.
