Dear Mr. Hyde,
A thousand thanks for keeping me so
ready for Philo.  That
is what I desire. - When?
I fully appreciate that
great a service it will
be to take to mental
time as much, 
it is good luck I
seldom get what I
may be able to find in the

[written in a faded pencil in the background]
 the sense of leaving for good one who though talking very sensibly yet occasionally strikes one as not being just right.  Lovingly, Minnie M.W. 
[from another letter, top left corner upside down]
 quite certain he is totally unfitted
 to be intrusted with the
[â€¦] 
self-control. I feel it a duty
 to say this much tho' I know
 you will not thank me. 
 Minnie M.W.
