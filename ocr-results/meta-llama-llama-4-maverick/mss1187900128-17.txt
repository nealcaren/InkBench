I know Mr. where to find pastries for them, I appeal to your judgement.  I have ever been friendly to the Colonel LaRue, during deceased many years at past Hayti on the Island of Hayti, where my husband Worth a prominent commercial house, under the name of Villem, Laroche. Also, we are well known as the present President of Hayti, as you guess he was interested in the purchase of coffee for the house of Villem, LaRoche.  Also, Mr. Vilson was also known for the United States, and the recognition of Hayti was effected by him.  For which I demand no reward in the state Department. Be so kind as to use your influence to promote the interest of the colored people. By begging you to excuse me for addressing you I remain

Very Respectfully
Francis L. Wilson
