or to prescribe specific regulations for the administration of 
the government. But he came to be redeemed men from sin— to "establish 
to "swile the law of love upon their hearts"— to establish 
princes and proclaim precepts, before whose searching 
and all-pervading influence the hardened systems of 
injustice and oppression shall melt away.

Perhaps I may now, Mr. Speaker, to examine, for a few mo-
ments, some of the objections which are urged against the 
legislation of Congress on this subject.

We are told, in the first place, that this is a question 
which concerns exclusively the people of this District; that 
the petitioners have no interest in it, and have no more right 
to the Legislature of Virginia to abolish slavery here than they have to 
interfere with the local legislation which may be adopted within her 
limits. The people who have signed these petitions regard 
themselves as citizens, not alone of the particular States in 
which they reside, but of the Republic. Every interest is their in-
terest within the scope of the legislation of Congress is their in-
terest. Everything which concerns this Territory comm-
cerns them: its police; the value and security of the public 
property within its limits; and the safety of the Represen-
tative bodies annually assembled here. This is the growing 
capital of a great Republic. What may be the absolute in-
crease of its slave population, or how much it 
may effect the future condition of this District, cannot exist 
be foreseen of, and that no fear of "excitement" 
while upon earth.* Now, sir, let gentlemen show me that Africans are not 
"men," and I will give up the argument. But until this 
Revelation, that "God hath made of one blood all nations 
of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth" and until 
this great truth ceases to find a response in every human 
bosom, shall slavery stand rebuked by this all-comprehen-
sive and sublime precept of the Saviour of men.

But, air, the religion which contains this precept, also 
enjoins subjection to the "powers that be." The same 
month which uttered it said, "render unto Cæsar that which 
exhorts—servants be obedient to your own masters; not 
answering again; not purloining, but showing all good 
fidelity."* The Saviour made no part of his business, 
while upon earth, to subvert the existing order of things,
