My dear Douglass:

On my passage thro' 
New York yesterday from Phila. where I 
spoke on Friday evening, I called at Kem-
hard & Lo's office for news about the sailing 
of our steamer. And this is what the clerks 
in the office assured me:
The steamer is the "Oranje Nassau".
She will sail from Pierpont Stores (along 
side of the Wall St. ferry), Brooklyn, 
on Friday next, 5th instant at noon for 
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count our this 
information as entirely reliable. 
I have always understood that the 
"Oranje Nassau" is the protest steamer of the line.  Now she is stanch and sound and 
guess we can stand it for six days on board
