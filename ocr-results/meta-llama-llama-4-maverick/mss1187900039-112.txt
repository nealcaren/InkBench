Dear Father

Yours of the 18st. is just rec'd
I have an account of one of your lecture on New
Jersey published in the N.York Tribune, and I am glad
that you may have other opportunities, and hearing from you.  All are well except the baby, he has a severe
cold 's is attending him, we are afraid he
will have the cramps; but hope not.  I dont wish to double
    your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and my
self I know your mind and time as both occupied. You
may know the cause of the difficulty, but believe you dont
know the woth truth, and it will hand to find it out under the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone
against us, look for other was.  I length of time I shall write again soon, as I am very buis now. Little world send love, if she knew
I was writing. Love to mother and all.

Your Aff. Son
