Friend Douglass.

I started from Rochester yesterday 
morning to stop a leak to Hemlock Lake.
Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp
a few rods north of the High Reservoir.
I attached a pocket instrument upon the 
wire and communicated with the person 
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your 
postal card.  Before I left home I read 
your telegram & went to the office 
where the draft was prepared and notified 
them of its non-reception, and asked 
for a duplicate.  They said that they 
could not give another until they had 
received this one from the Clearing house 
at N.Y., which would be the first week
