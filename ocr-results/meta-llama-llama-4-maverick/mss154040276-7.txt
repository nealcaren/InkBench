My dear Mary:- 
I feel perfectly ashamed for not having written to you all these weeks.  Again I say with our dearly beloved Chief.  However there seemed to be so much to do each day and I did not have to send you a hurried note but a real letter full of details which no one else could give you.  Mrs Catt read me parts of your letter and we are both much interested in your lovely trip and so glad you are having such a grand time.  You Certainly Can give the liveliest descriptions of things and we much enjoy the amusing spirit and wit.  Well to begin with the very beginning.  I came I was Certainly very worried about Mother Catt and I felt could not await the day to land. Then I came on a Saturday afternoon Dec: 8th and the dear Lady was waiting for me on the platform in New Rochelle.  You Can imagine that the first two days there was very very much to talk about and to tell.  The dear Lady poured it all out to me and it seemed to relieve her greatly although there were many tears, I still felt she liked to tell
