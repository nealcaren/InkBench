ponne, and I trust I shall
have your approval as well as
that of friend Bassett.

Mr. Blaine has been sick in New
York for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get afoat.  There
is much malaise manifested in
his condition.

I thank you for long and very
kind letter, and regret that I don't
feel well enough to pay to you
now all that I had it in mind
to pay when I began it. But we
you worked hard when we are
very young men ambitious to run
a long race.

With my kind regards.
Your truly,
J.H.H. Huson
