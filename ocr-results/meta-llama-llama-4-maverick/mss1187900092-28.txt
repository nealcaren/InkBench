Dear Grandpa:-

I have learned with
much surprise that you are still
in the city of Washington enjoying
an extended leave of absence from
your post of duty, I am very glad
that such a leave has been granted
you, and know that you are far
happier on Cedar Hill than any
place you can go and I only wish
that matters could be arranged
so as to allow you to remain in this
