Grandpa was never called "Lloyd"
He was first Frederick Bailey the slave
changed to Johnson when he ran
away and because the man in
whose home he lived in Bedford
Mass. was named Johnson, this man
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglass" asked
grandpapa - to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, wished
would like to call himself
Douglass instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told him one name to him 
was as good as another and hence-
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass - 
These are facts - not hearsay.

Later - Just received letter from Fred - he
leaves on his "debating tour" to day -
and many debates at Ashland. He
meets stop with or. & Mrs. 
Joe's wife & Mamie and Aunt Ora ward.
