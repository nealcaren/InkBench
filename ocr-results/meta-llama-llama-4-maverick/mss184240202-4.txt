Dear friend

I have been longing for
some days to sit down & write
you a long letter, but have
been too much sore of late
to do so.  I am
anxious to be worried
with the thought that
someone outside is
working like a horse
for me.  I am sure no one

*sent a letter to*

*indecipherable words* 
will be of much use to me.

*many indecipherable words*
