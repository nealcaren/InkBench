was written here. He is still
strong and vigorous in his eighty
fifth year. His four lectures -
two of which he gave recently in 
the home of Judge Duryee in our 
city - are very interesting.

We have very pleasant and warm 
memories of our call made upon 
you upon our way home from 
Toronto. And hope we may have 
the pleasure of a visit from you 
when you come again to Boston.
We have a fine Cabinet Photo of 
yourself. and wish we had one 
also of Mrs Douglass to whom M.
feels very strongly attracted.

We hope this may find both in excellent 
health and that we may hear from you
