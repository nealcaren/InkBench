live your life - and do all so slow 
that God knows.  Mrs - Now

Mr. Starr, old neighbor & clerk 
of Mr. Ferris, while here and 
while the typist - is being very kind 
to me - remembered when - to subscribe

place for the young people to turn 
and find my last testimony 
by deeds for of love 
who sufficiently wants to help us do the 
work loving Sisters

worked entirely to a great joy to 
me and my dear - placed
