joined General Taylor's command at Aqua Nueva. The combined forces defeated Santa Anna at Buena Vista on 23 February 1847, ending the war in the north.

Marching from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Brig. Gen. Stephen W. Kearny occupied Santa Fe, New Mexico, and continued overland to California where he joined a naval task force. A column under Col. Alexander Doniphan marched south from Santa Fe, captured Chihuahua, and joined General Wool's command at Saltillo on 21 May 1847.

In the decisive operation of the war, Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott, supported by the Navy, captured Vera Cruz on 26 March 1847 and after defeating the Mexican Army at Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, and Molino Del Rey stormed Chapultepec and captured Mexico City on 14 September 1847.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 2 February 1848, restored peace and ceded New Mexico and California to the United States.

Demobilization was a continual process during the Mexican War as it had been in previous wars. At the conclusion of hostilities whole units were demobilized without prior planning. Army casualties in the Mexican war were approximately 1,700 men killed incident to battle, 4,000 wounded, and 12,000 who died from other causes.

During the war Dennis H. Mahan, a professor at the United States Military Academy, published a little book that became the prototype of all United States field service regulations. Both his instruction and his book, Advanced Guard, Outpost and Detachment Service of Troops, had considerable subsequent influence upon operational thinking in the United States Army.
