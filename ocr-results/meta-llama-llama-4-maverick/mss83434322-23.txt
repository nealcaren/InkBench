PURITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE BAL-LOT BOX.

"First pure." (Bible.) A corrupt use of 
the ballot-box is not Democracy, but an aris-
tocracy (money rule) of the most odious kind. 
The purity therefore of the franchise should 
be guarded by the severest penalties. Heavy 
fines, to go to informer on conviction of the 
offender, with imprisonment at hard labor, and 
partial loss of franchise for the first offence, 
and total loss for the second, would probably 
accomplish that end.

Purity, then, the election, — withdraw all 
sinister motives to a corrupt vote. Make the 
vote the simple expression of the uncorrupted 
sense and will of the voter, and open the 
franchise to every adult and human being. 
Mind rules the universe. Give it an open 
field and fair play, and let the national will, 
protected from sinister motives, and guided 
by the national intelligence, create and main-
tain the national institutions.

The third clause of my second proposition —
"the right to property in the common ele-
ments" — is so important that I beg, in con-
clusion, to make a few remarks upon it.

You will find the security of this right in-
dispensable to the reconstruction of our south-
ern communities.  Immence landed estates 
in a hands (baronies) the world over, 
ascribes to a Democracy. If three or four men 
own a whole country, they will be its governors. 
Its road system, school system, court, judges, 
officers, municipality and franchise, will all 
be controlled by them. They can and will, 
even under republican forms, secure their own 
election to the highest seats in the state and 
national counsels, and become there, as in 
former years, an element of jarring and per-
petual discord.

The landed estates, therefore, of all the 
prominent and active rebels, the great chiefs, 
should be confiscated and broken up, and 
these criminals are executed or transported, 
it might be to confer upon the soldiers 
and loyal men in the country, so much land as would con-
stitute a moderate homestead, while an equal 
homestead should be apportioned to each col-
ored family. These, in fact, have the first and 
highest right, since the clearing and improve-
ments have been done mainly by their labor. 
The soldiers, also, should receive bounties from 
it, and any left could be sold in limited quanti-
ties to loyal men.

In New Jersey the ballot-box is, in effect, 
sometimes set up openly for sale to the highest 
bidder, and so many bought votes taken at 
the polls that the unbought ones are deemed 
of little value to the candidates.  I have heard 
voters declare, here in Salem County, that 
the only benefit they could see in the franchise 
to the poor man, is the money he gets for 
his vote. To be sure, these were foreigners. 
I never heard a native say this, though many 
sell their votes. The abuse is so great that 
some respectable voters excuse themselves from 
voting as being useless. But ask those gentle-
men with the bribe money in their pockets 
what objection they have to a negro vote, 
and nearly every man will roll up his eyes 
and lift his hands in holy horror, as if you 
were covered all over with leprosy, or had 
just committed the unpardonable sin. Now 
I am not addressing these men. To reason 
with them would be ridiculous. But every 
anti-slavery man and political reformer will 
at once comprehend the justice and humanity 
of the following proposition.

RECONSTRUCTION:
A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE 
L. STEARNS.

Elmer, Salem Co., N. J. 
Feb. 27, 1865.

George L. Stearns, Esq., Boston, Mass.

Sir, - I lately received from you two com-
munications, in which you advance certain 
propositions, and ask my influence and sup-
port for them.

1st. To organize the anti-slavery men of 
the country.

2d. To bring their combined influence to 
bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the 
social and political institutions of the Rebel 
States, and to remodel our financial system, in 
order to correct abuses growing out of slavery.

3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew, 
of Massachusetts, a seat in the Cabinet at 
Washington, as an able and faithful exponent 
of anti-slavery principles and measures.

I reply - I am not acquainted with the pe-
culiar abuses of our "financial system" grow-
ing out of slavery, nor aware that some other 
champion of freedom might not be as proper a 
candidate for a seat in the Cabinet as Gov. An-
drew, though I think he would shed lustre 
upon that position; and if I can be of any ser-
vice in an organization.whose object is, after 
the Rebellion explodes, to reconstruct the Rebel 
States, and re-unite them upon the basis of lib-
erty and equal rights,you can put my name 
down upon your anti-slavery record.

That you may not mistake me, I will state a 
few fundamental propositions which I hold in-
dispensable to that end.

1st. The unity of the human race. God is "our 
father." All men are brothers, and the dis-
tinction between a man and a beast is infinite.

2d. Equality of rights. All human 
beings have an equal right - 1st, to life and 
liberty ; 2d, the development and culture of 
body, mind, and moral nature. The Govern-
ment must secure these to the State, because 
its health, wealth, prosperity and highest hap-
piness depend upon the fullest possession and 
enjoyment of them. 3d, the right to property 
in the common elements of nature, — light, air, 
water and the land. The right to these ele-
ments is inalienable, becaue they constitute 
the elements of the human body, which could 
not for a moment exist without them, and be-
cause God created them for the maintenance, 
in every age, of all the living. They are a 
common gift, which no man has a right to mo-
nopolize, and which the governing Power is 
bound to secure to each citizen who needs 
them, or who desires them.

3d. Responsibility of Government. 
Government is responsible for the equal pro-
tection and faithful promotion of the highest 
well-being of each individual within its domain.

4th. Monopolies.  The State is bound by 
legislative obligations only so far as these were 
necessary to its life and well-being. No 
existing generation can, by its legislation, bind 
the next generation to maintain unwise stat-
utes to the public life, health and happiness.

5th. The Franchise. On this subject I give 
an illustrative statement before I give 
the principle. 
If you anti-slavery gentlemen who are form-
ing an organization to reconstruct the rebel 
states, should be wanting in intelligence to 
comprehend the magnitude of this great land 
question, let me admonish you that you are not 
qualified for the duty you have undertaken. I 
make this remark because the idea is not em-
braced in your printed communications.

In this letter I send you my political daguer-
reotype, -Democratic and Republican in every 
feature. If you conclude it will not disgrace 
your anti-slavery gallery, you will hang it up 
there among the rest.
