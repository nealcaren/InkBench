secure its payment by a mortgage on farm 
stock, implements & household furniture.  
the stock counts of from a few hours, the 
1/2 already cons, a few already 
for Alfalfa, wheat corn, a few alfalfa 
bee, 3 Jaspers 1 fancy Camp, farm 
wagons etc.  - the forward fire & its 
sort continue.  Farming implements
are required upon such a place.  
this farm is fixed at prices not 
from  $16.00 & on full there nice & sold 
two often during of prices, as it is worth 
continually more money.

they makes not alone one task this 
afforn 
farm you had for the absolute Exchange 
of the seeming they offer- no more 
I do it at all, but in the emergeny 
of their situation's should the place 
be forced at auction sale, it needs 
mine the sale firstly, as you will 
see at a glance.

inform me, I will have the necessary 
paper executed take them & you

Can do it, or nice & deeply pathetic
