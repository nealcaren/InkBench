My dear Steadly; I have to thank you for his
letter and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs. Blinn. I thank you especially for the clip-
pings for as you respect, I am interested
in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention, I [?stien?] Mrs Sweet brought
a letter she had received from Effie T[?????],
and she had described very vividly how
Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her
suffering thro' Christian Science. Susie's
hears from as she read it, and she was no
great admirer of Mrs. B. I believe she has
me that Effie was also getting relief
exlib in Ch[rist?]  Mrs. B. was one of the most
generous and forgiving natures I ever
met, and altho' she also had her 
of character, as well as firm of pur, she was
a woman to be admired for very many
estimable qualities.
