I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not send my clock to the Cambridge League for the National League. I am enclosing a check for $5.00 if I have already paid will you destroy this check.  My old clock broke at Cambridge as I cannot look it up.
I hope I have been getting some rain, enough to keep down the forest fires that not been deluged as we have been,

it has rained almost continuously since early May, from the first to nineteenth of June we had fifteen days of rain.  Will probably be by the middle of July and will phone to learn the amount of the fund.

Very cordially
Sara du Pont
