And his wretched man with ropes 
Did rack each golden limb, 
And with my heart I saw them on 
To see my passion's Lord

Again, I stood beside the gate
My heart was plucked und free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

Growing old.
The prison house in which I live
Is b[ill]ing to decay,
But God renew'd my spirit strength
Within - made walls of clay.

For me a dimmell though' ens
wroth Earth's fair[ill] light -
but heaven doth cl[os]e my e[ye]s
And [o]pen to my spi[ri]t-.

And his wretched man with ropes 
Did rack each golden limb, 
And with my heart I saw them on 
To see my passion's Lord

Again, I stood beside the gate
My heart was plucked und free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

The original transcription appears to be a poem with some illegible words. Here is a possible corrected version:

And his wretched man with ropes 
Did rack each golden limb, 
And with my heart I saw them on 
To see my passion's Lord

Again, I stood beside the gate
My heart was plucked and free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

F.B. Meyer.

Growing old.
The prison house in which I live
Is building to decay,
But God renew'd my spirit strength
Within - made walls of clay.

For me a dimmell though' earth ens
Wroth Earth's fairest light -
But heaven doth close my eyes
And open to my spirit-.
