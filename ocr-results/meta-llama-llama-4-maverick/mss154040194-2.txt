Dear Mrs Chapin Cott

To take in our proportion of his you[r] lectures on "Famous Women."  Mrs Jameson and I will do it, she in her Y.W.C.A. and vice popular evening course. But as here are no complete libraries in Roumania and not a "single feminists library, it is impossible for us even to know the title of the book necessary for supplementary reading.  Leads us therefore to you as to the other sections of Y.W.C.A. to ask your help.

Feeling so much the lips of a few library we will my at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and perhaps then we will be able to assemble round it the Women in a club & we are dreaming of nice a long time.  Would you, association be able for the generous act of more help unto sister who sends one or the old standard work on women movement in your country and specially books, there we could find biographies of your famous women.

We would speak in a first serie of lectures on political and social 
procminent Women and in a second draw the portrais of Women 
mad and Science." But we know so little, it is to say not much
