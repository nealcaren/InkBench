CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT,
CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON ORGANIZATION.
133 WORLD BUILDING, NEW YORK.

April 20th 1895

Dear Mr. Blackwell:-

I pondered over your letter and I cannot
see my duty in the matter.  If I thought you might I could
be of any particular aid in Utah I should go.  I will try and feel
the pulse of things there, a little more and then give a definite
answer.  I had hoped the conference would do the work.  I did not
think Miss Anthony could do it, but I relied upon the workers from
Wyoming and Colorado; as I wrote you I began to feel worried about
it myself, and I am not at all sure that I can understand the sta-
tus of the question there.  The reports in the newspapers are
often times so garbled that it is impossible to tell what is the
truth.  We are greatly handicapped by not having any Gentiles to
write to.  I am very sure I could never convert the Editor of the
Salt Lake Tribune, if he is in truth opposed to it.  A conversion
must be a growth.  I think it is almost impossible to make an enemy
out of an enemy.  If you hear of anything that gives you any clue
to the question status there I hope you will let me know.  If it
so happens that by my going there I could do good, I am sure I will
very gladly go. I am,

Yours sincerely,

Carrie Chapman Catt
