Capt. Darlington and emdorson crape paper
describing the two varities.  She didn't get anything
my millie & Chris Carr. Daniels definitely stated they
could from the Dartwicks at $3 per 100.  Just why
that Office shouldn't furnish crape paper
any one can see
is a mystery.  I showed think they neglected
the canvassing consumersly of paper assining
hereto is that Rochester didn't get its head-
guarters awarded for may 2. and the Capt.
guarded to my Conference cannot take the
deranums home with them.  that is a long
way from officiency.  Please see whatis
he matter and who didn't furnish crape
pup.. I could scarcely belive her
fusilly.

C.O.S.
