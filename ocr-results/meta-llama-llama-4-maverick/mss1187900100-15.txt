Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement foot here to move three thousand families out West. We are trying making every effort to supply the money. In the name of God call upon you to assist us & share friends to assist.  This work comes directly from the cabins of the poor oppressed down trodden & untold Southern negroes to the northern people.  If we are dead men without a hope, all we want is to get away from our oppressors & then we can Educate our children We have Aunt Mutual help to remove friends & we ask you to do the same in behalf of poor suffering humanity
