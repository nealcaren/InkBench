feel that I am growing old
are not now what I have
been - although time has
been quite generous with
me - you will see by
this letter that it harden
for me to write smoothly
in old times when my
nerves were stead
and strong -give my
kind regards to your
wife in which my goodwife
hartity joins - Ever this
hastily written note and
believe me as Ever your
friend and wellwisher
James N. Buffume

Ruth says, come and see
us.  I say Amen.  I hope you have
now an engagement not
