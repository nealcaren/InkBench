at the Howard Theatre as segregation just as much
seats in the Auditorium. If these singers appear
quinnquennial it will be expressly against our orders."
There was no difference of opinion among
preceding orgofship and chaperonzing visitors. I fearned that
they denied the opportunity of entertaining them,
particularly the women from foreign lands who were
eager to see and listen to them. Indeed, everybody friendly to us regretted also that the race has lost
such a fine chance of displaying its musical ability
through its talented representatives and of proving
to what a high standard of excellence it had attained. But, under the circumstances the rendition
of the program was impossible. The members of the choirs
and the choruses who were to present in the program
that night heard how those of their own race who are inclined to complain said they were too depressed to sing.

Delegate to the International Peace Congress.
The following letter which was received one morning about the middle of
December, 1918 thrilled me with surprise and joy. "Dear Mrs. Terrell," it
read, "It gives me real pleasure to inform you that at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Woman's Peace Party, which is the section for the U.S.A. of the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace, held in New York City
November 24, you were elected as one of thirty delegates and Alternates to the
International Congress of Women which it was arranged at the Hague in 1915
during the time of the Peace Conference at the end of the War."
The letter stated that it was likely the meeting would be held either at Paris
or The Hague and the time might be either the first week in February or early
in May.

"We realize," the letter concluded, "that this is not an easy journey
which we are inviting you to take under crowded conditions, in winter, to western countries. But we sincerely hope that your love of human welfare will minimize the difficulties and that you will be able to go with us. Faithfully yours,
Alice Thatcher Post, Secretary of Delegates from the U.S.A." Mrs. Post was the
Assistant
wife of Mr. Louis Post who was then Secretary of Labor under President Woodrow
Wilson.

I was working for the War Camp Community Service at the time and was in
the South trying to induce some of the Committees of the large cities to sanction the establishment of centers for colored women and girls. After completing
the summary of the conditions which obtained in these cities I sent it to head-
quarters and asked for a leave of absence to go as a delegate to the Peace Con-
gress which would be held in Europe. This was granted in the following letter:
"My dear Mrs. Terrell: Thank you for the summary; it is a fine piece of work
and the classification workers are delighted with it. It will help us materially
in understanding the problems of the cities you visited. We wish to express our
appreciation of the devoted service you have given W.C.C.S. through the past
months, and willingly grant you the leave of absence to enable you to make the
important trip abroad. Wishing you success in your new undertaking, Very sincerely
yours, (signed) Geo. E. Bickie, Director Field Department."
