cause that I know I have
done with thee. The last
time I saw her she scarcely
paid me "the cold respect of
a passing glance". See you,
Mrs. Putnam, Quite Just -

I did not speak of the
labors in the Cause of the
slave performed by Miss Kelly?
Think you, of the many other
excellent women who were
not mentioned.
Faithfully. Yours,
Fredk. Douglass.
