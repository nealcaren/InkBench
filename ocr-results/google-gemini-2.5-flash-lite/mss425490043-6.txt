The luncheon takes place at 1 o'clock P.M.
and the length of time devoted to ad-
dress is about an hourly five minutes

Please let me have a short sketch
which we may use for publication in
our newspapers relating to yourself
and your public work. We would like
to have this by Thursday a.m. of the coming

notes for next week.
Mr. Davis and I shall be very much
pleased to have you as our guest
while in our city.
