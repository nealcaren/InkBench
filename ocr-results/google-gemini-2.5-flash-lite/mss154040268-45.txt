To the Speakers Bureau

Roses sind Verboten

Ruch your money bodyed the suit to vindicate my
character. Please dont desobey orders again.
I have a vile temper, growing riler every day, which
shows what polities met do for a woman. If
is a dally comfort to witness the placidity of

the Speakers Bureau!'
