Dear Sir,
I have thought of an expedient to bring
in Caroline which I submit to you. It is the Genl.
Mosely is mustering his force to leave for Messissippi.
Now if you cauto disperse MÂ¹. Sames & see Gene all
& let her go & stay; he negro & get it out that he has bought
her. It would I am sure bring her in & Let her be out 
that it is an arrangement of mine over which you have    
no control: what do you think of it? Let me know.
Your truly,
Jn O Meile
