ROBERT G. INGERSOLL,

Dear Douglass.

I think the quotation
at the head of your article
a little bit off color. There
is an appeal to mercy
rather than to justice –
I think the following from
the same play is better.
'' You take my house when you
do take the prop
That doth sustain my house: You
take my life,
When you do take the means
Whereby I live”
You will pardon
the injection, What do you
say?
