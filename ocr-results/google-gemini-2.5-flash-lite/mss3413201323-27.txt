THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.

Some Iowa newspapers carry the
erroneous impression that the special
law enforcement agents are appointed by the attorney general. These
special officers are named by the
governor. If Iowa should elect a
"liberal" governor he probably would
have "liberal" special agents.—Sioux
City Tribune.

MR. IRISH GROWING OLD.

Nothing is sadder than to see over
than the change that comes over so
many men as they shift from the
buoyant enthusiasms of youth to the
view-with-alarm despondency of age.
We do not know of an illustration
more to the point than the speeches
John P. Irish is now making in
Iowa against woman suffrage when
contrasted with the speeches he
made in the Iowa legislature for
woman suffrage.
John P. Irish was a forward look-
ing man in the old days when with
spontaneous eloquence he pleaded for
equal rights. Now he is as solemnly
alarmed as any other pessimist.
It is really too bad that so many

When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage

In the legislative session of 1870
an amendment proposing woman suf-
frage was passed by both houses of
the Iowa legislature, and passed the
house in the session of 1872. It was
defeated in the senate of 1872 and
so the amendment was not submitted
to popular vote. John P. Irish engi-
neered the amendment through the
house both in 1870 and 1872. John
A. Kasson was member from Polk,
and he voted for the amendment at
both sessions.

This amendment was far-reaching
and read as follows:

Laws of Iowa, 1870: 252. Joint
Resolution No. 14. Joint constitution
proposing to amend the constitution
of the state of Iowa, and to provide
for its reference and publication.

Be it resolved by the general assembly of the state of Iowa, That the
following amendments to the consti-
tution of the state of Iowa, be and
are hereby proposed:

1. Strike from section 1 of article
II of said constitution, the word
"male."

2. Strike from section 4 of article
III of said constitution, the word
"male."

And Madison in his message to
congress in that year, referring to a
refusal of some of the states to fur-
nish militiamen for the war showed
conclusively in what regard the
standing army was held when he
said that in a failure of the militia
"the public safety may have no other
resource than in those large and per-
manent military establishments
which are forbidden by the principles
of our free government, and against
the necessity of which the militia
were meant to be a constitutional
bulwark."

Nor was this a sentiment confined
to the colonies and the young re-
public. Ambrose Clement writing
in Lalor's "Encyclopedia of Political
Science" says, "A very able German
author, Mr. Rotteck, published in
1816 an important work entitled
'Standing Armies and National Mil-
itia.' He proves from the history of all
wars, from those of the most ancient
peoples down to the termination of
the war of 1815, that standing armies or paid troops, under the sole con-.

corded all their civil rights, more
privilege of obtaining education, or
rights than they knew how to care
for; and yet, we unsasked, have con-
ferred upon them an additional privi-
lege, and the right to participate in
the making of the law that shall gov-
ern you and me.
Then I say, having done so much
for a class that had passed through
a long concition of servitude, and
that were steeped in ignorance and
barbarism—a class that had not
asked for anything—are we now to
make such base use of the power
conferred upon us as lawmakers of the
people as to deny to another and
more important class—the women of
this land—the privilege for which
they plead? The power is in our
hand. If we deny their prayer, we
make a bas- use of the power we
hold. Gentlemen ask what moreprivi-
leges do women want. Is she not
the idol of our homes; the queen
of our household and heart? I grant
all that, in many cases; but remem-
ber, gentlemen, that while women
may be the idol of our homes and
the queen of our heart and household,
there are thousands of that class who
have the strong arm of no.

you must take a step forward. You
must proceed to the logical result
that must follow the opening of the
universities which have given birth in
the minds of women to these aspira-
tions which education ever brings to
those who possess it. We are at the
inception of the question. How can
the experiment be demonstrated a
disaster? How can the family,
around which we should throw every
safeguard, suffer by the prosecution
of this experiment? For who has a
warmer, or a more heartfelt interest
in the main-nance of the family, in
all its purity and goodness, than
woman has? When woman is con-
viced that the family, in its organ-
ization, must suffer by this experi-
ment, will you tell me that she will
not be the first to recede from this
position? I am willing to leave the
matter in her hands, and if the fam-
ily is to suffer or be degraded, I
know she will abandon the prosecu-
tion of a dangerous experiment.

IN A SECOND SPEECH.
Mr. Irish—I am requested by the
gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Ball)
to read certain parts of the Holy
scripture. They are the Corinthians,
fourteenth chapter, thirty-fourth and
thirty-fifth verses; Epistle of Paul
to Timothy, eleventh and twelfth
verses. If I were competent to do
so before this legislature, I would
move an amendment to those pas-
sages. (Laughter.) But as that is
not competent, I would say, in ex-
planation, that Paul was then speak-
ing to the Corinthian women--I do
not know what sort they were. They
may have been utterly unqualified to
speak in public, and it might have
been proper that Paul should exhort
them to keep silence in churches. He
said nothing of the American women,
that they should keep silence at the
polls or legislature. Paul claimed
inspiration; but it is singular that
nowhere in the writing of his divine
master do you find such sentiments
expressed. Jesus, in the most sub-
lime of all his sayings, in his sermon
on the mount, exalted men and
women to deeds of charity, to be mer-
ciful, and humble that they may one
day walk with their God. This book
teaches that men and women should
alike endure trial and suffer judg-
ments of the law, should alike die
and arise at the resurrection. As
they are to travel side by side spirit-
ually, does it seem wise that we
should place women in a temporary
position of disadvantage, where their
ambition is to be unsatisfied, where
her aspirations are never to be real-
ized? If we can make her live better
and more wisely should we not do it?
In doing that we are obeying the
spirit of the scripture. I care not
what might have been said by
Paul or any other apostle, who was
so unfortunate as to live and die a
bachelor. It is better to refer to the
writings of the divine master and not
to the teachings of one who was a
little bit headstrong and pedantic in
his views and manner of expression.
The gentleman from Dubuque (Mr.
O'Donnel) has ably spoken on the


" WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN COLORADO."
Washington Bureau of The Des
Moines Register: In an interview
Senator John F. Shiroth of Colorado
vigorously champions the cause of
woman suffrage, and specifically de-
mands woman suffrage with its own
state against churches recently

rather than money will determine selectees. in his
state against churches recently made
that equal suffrage had proved a failure in Colo-
rado.

"My attention has been directed
to statements made by Mr. Maling,
published in Iowa papers, to the ef-
fect that woman suffrage in Colo-
rado was a failure and should be
"abandoned," said Senator Shafterh.
"These statements are not substan-
tiated by the facts, and while I would
not dignify them by calling attention
to specific indictments, I wish to
state that in my judgment the experience of twenty-three years of
suffrage in the state of Colorado has conclusively demonstrated its right-
iousness, its expediency and its prac-
ticability from every point of view.

"Do women want equal suf-
frage? Ask the women of Colorado.
Submit the question to those who have tried
and scarcely a small minority can
be found to vote against it. When-
ever a law is disapproved of, the ex-
pression of that disapproval has
appeals for its repeal. Col-
orado has had equal suffrage for
twenty-three years, yet no petitions
for its repeal have ever been pre-
sented.

"The fact that member of
assurance that that body has no
legitimate question to the
shows that there is no demand
for any change in the elective fran-
chise of that state.
"Furthermore, believe in amend-
ing the federal constitution so as to
provide equal suffrage. To us of 
Colorado who believe that influence
in government has always been and
is sure to continue to be for the ad-
vancement of all good and moral
legislation, it is inconceivable that
woman's right to vote could do
harm or wrong to any state.

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.

The Register recently asked of the
Chicago Tribune "why did not Wash-
ington and Madison and Jefferson
and Hamilton and the constitution
makers meet the situation and give
this country an army and a navy at
the start?"

The T ribune comes back with the
claim that these men would have
given us a military establishment but
blind congress would not listen to
them. The Tribune quotes a num-
ber of familiar passages from Wash-
ington, and then jumps to the con-
clusion that our school histories
ought to be rewritten to show the
military purposes of the fathers.

It is not worth while to quibble
while to get at the real point of view
of the men who started this nation
out, in the military sense, without a mil-
itary fitting, in the belief that a
great, peaceable, industrial democ-
racy could be built in this new land
free from the follies and blunders
that had wrecked every earlier at-
tempt at human organization.

The Register will not go to the
school histories, but will go to Alex-
ander Hamilton, because of all the
