all this to acquire necessary experience & to be
relieved by this. I would help, that I fully know
their trouble, could not but make common cause
with them – If so it is but a blessing in disguise!
And now let me add that on Easter eve. J
was caught by the Director of Stuarts Institute,
mentioned in anocient paper, – To tell me he had
proof that Philanthropic money "as he called it could
be found in the North, (in fact had been offered)
at our interest, for such ruck-work as Stuarts Institute
– to which he added the suggestion mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 4 Pages of the
Chicago
Daily Inter-Ocean of 25 March, giving an account
of a succesful colored colonization at Tuskegee,
Alabama - to which I refer you, as one to interest
you – It is a number of 62 pages, printed at
immense of copies as its 21 anniversary, which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair – When upon this I heard of your work,
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion, & counsel how best to proceed
I feel sure of your sympathy for the cause – &
perhaps for and long \"ze.\" "so remain, hopefully
& with very best wishes of the season for your
continued prosperity, most truly yours.
