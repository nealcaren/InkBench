Buc., 7. of Sept. 1922.

Dear Mrs Chapman, Cath.

“We took in our programme of this year,
to read lectures on „Famous Women“, „ Mrs Reus Jamuleseu and
I will do it, she in the 1. d. D. f. and in popular evening course.
But as there are no complete libraries in Roumania and not
a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know
the title of the book, necessary for prepare. We address
to you as to the other sections of I. W. S. N. to ask you help.

Feeling so much the lipss of a few library we will
try at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and
perhaps than will be able to assemble round it the
women in a club, as we are dreaming of since a long time.
Would your association be able for the generous act of some
help unto sisters and to send us one of the other standard work
on women movement in your country and specially
books, there we could find biographies of your famous women.

we would spek in a first serie of lectures, on political and social
prominent Women and in a second draw the portraits of famous
mad and science. But we know so little, it is to say, not much.
