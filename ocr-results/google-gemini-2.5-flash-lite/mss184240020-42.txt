My dear sister,
I write first of all,
about Edeinus, - because after a long
talk we held about himself last night,
that takes the first place. I read thy
little note to him from Findlay in

to week, and his energy and ability to
go or do anything grow less continually.
Last night, after ma had gone to bed,
he spoke for the first time.  He says
he finds his digestion rather better, but
his stamina lessened so that he can
no longer use most of the remedies -
whether of the allopathy or homeo-
pathic school, that used to clear
