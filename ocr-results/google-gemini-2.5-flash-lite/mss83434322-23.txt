RECONSTRUCTION:

A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE
L. STEARNS.

ELMER, SALEM Co., N. J.
Feb. 27, 1865.

GEORGE L. STEARNS, Esq., Boston, Mass.
SIR, I lately received from you two communications, in which you advance certain
propositions, and ask my influence and support for them.
1st. To organize the anti-slavery men
of the country.
2d. To bring their combined influence to
bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the
Social and political institutions of the Rebel
States, and to remodel our financial system, in
order to correct abuses growing out of slavery.
3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew,
of Massachusetts, a seat in the Cabinet at
Washington, as an able and faithful exponent
of anti-slavery principles and measures.

I reply - I am not acquainted with the peculiar abuses of our "financial system" growing out of slavery, nor aware that some other
champion of freedom might not be as proper a
candidate for a seat in the Cabinet as Gov. Andrew, though I think he would shed lustre
upon that position; but if I can be of any service in an organization whose object is, after
the Rebellion explodes, to reconstruct the Rebel
States, and re-unite them upon the basis of liberty and equal rights, you can put my name
down upon your anti-slavery record.

That you may not mistake me, I will state a
few fundamental propositions which I hold indispensable to that end.

1st. THE UNITY AND ESSENTIAL EQUALITY OF THE HUMAN RACE. God is "our
FATHER." All men are brothers, and the distinction between a man and a beast is immense.
2d. EQUALITY OF RIGHTS. All human
beings have an equal right—1st, to life and
liberty; 2d, the development and culture of
body, mind, and moral nature. The Government should secure these to the State, because
its health, wealth, prosperity and highest happiness depend upon the fullest possession and
enjoyment of them. 3d, the right to property –
in the common elements of nature,—light, air,

PURITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE BALLOT BOX.

“First pure." (Bible.) A corrupt use of
the ballot-box is not Democracy, but an aristocracy (money rule) of the most odious kind.
The purity therefore of the franchise should
be guarded by the severest penalties. Heavy fines, to go to informer on conviction of the
offender, with imprisonment at hard labor, and
partial loss of franchise for the first offence,
and total loss for the second, would probably
accomplish that end.

Purify, then, the election, — withdraw all
sinister motives to a corrupt vote. Make the
vote the simple expression of the uncorrupted
sense and will of the voter, and open the
franchise to every adult and human being.
Mind rules the universe. Give it an open
field and fair play, and let the national will,
protected from sinister motives, and guided
by the national intelligence, create and maintain the national institutions.

The third clause of my second proposition—
"the right to property in the common elements"—is so important that I beg, in conclusion, to make a few remarks upon it.

You will find the security of this right indispensable to the reconstruction of our southern communities. Immense landed estates
in a few hands (baronies) the world over,
are death to Democracy. If three or four men
own a whole country, they will be its governors.
Its road system, school system, court, judges,
officers, municipality and franchise, will all
be controlled by them. They can and will,
under republican forms, secure their own
election to the highest seats in the state and
national counsels, and become there, as in
former years, an element of jarring and perpetual discord.

The landed estates, therefore, of all the
prominent and active rebels, the great chiefs,
should be confiscated and broken up. After
these criminals are executed or transported,
might be safe to confer upon such heirs as remained in the country, and should take the
oath of allegiance, so much land as would constitute a moderate homestead, while an equally
homestead should be apportioned to each colored family. These, in fact, have the first and
highest right, since the clearing and improvements have been done mainly by their labor.
The soldiers, also, should receive bounties from
it, and any left could be sold in limited quantities to loyal men.

in chofen spokesman of the negroes was Garrison Frazier. On being asked, "How can your
people take care of themselves?" he replied:
"The way we can best take care of ourselves
is to have land, and turn and till it by our own
labor." All this man's replies to the Secretary
and General were marked by uncommon
shrewdness and good sense, but this excelled.
How has he a country who has got no home?
Who habitually sells himself to somebody for a
day or week to get bread for his family?

If, then, you wish to uproot slavery, break
up land monopoly. Twin strands of one rope,
slavery in some form will ever feed its insatiate
maw upon stolen industry, so long as land
monopoly shall be allowed to exist. The new
freedom of the South, under the old land
monopoly will be worse to the feeble and decrepit than their former slavery. Stung with
poverty and desolation caused by the rebellion,
the barbarous land-barons, with blind rage and
malignant hate will vent their spleen on the
innocent and helpless freedman, and, charging
him with being the cause of their ruin, with an
oppression unknown to former times of successful slavery, will grind him to powder. God
help the poor ignorant negroes, who without
any home, or legal claim to the elements of
life, shall be compelled, day by day, to offer his
labor to such masters in order to get bread for
his wife and children! No, the government
that shall permit land monopoly to wield its
blighting curse over four millions of ignorant
freedmen, shall permit land monopoly to wield its
blighting curse over four millions of ignorant
freedmen, shall permit land monopoly to wield its

In this letter I send you my political daguerreotype,—Democratic and Republican in every
feature. If you conclude it will not disgrace
your anti-slavery gallery, you will hang it up
there among the rest.
