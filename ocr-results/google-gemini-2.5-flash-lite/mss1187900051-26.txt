Friend Douglass.

I started from Rochester yesterday.
morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake.
Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp 
a few holes north of the Rush Reservoir.
I attached a pocket instrument upon the
wire and communicated with the person 
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your
postal card, Before I left home I recd
your telegram & went to the Rock Sav. Bk.
where the debt was procured and notified
them of its non reception, and of your wish
for a duplicate. They said that they
could not give another until they had
received their ape from the Clearing house
at NY, which would be the first week.
