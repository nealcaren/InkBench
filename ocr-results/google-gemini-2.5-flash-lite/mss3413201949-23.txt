(1) The Senseless Waste of War
When the great War began $$7 billions of old War debts
stood upon the books of Europe. The total coin money
& bullion in circulation in the whole world was about
eleven billions of dollars, yet the nations plunged
all mell into the War, borrowing all they could,
printing paper money, & not stopping to count the
cost. At the end the international debts were so
complicated & burdensome that a universal panic
followed. What senseless waste! Any wonder they
can not pay their debts to us?
Do you know that every man killed in the late
War cost the living $17,800?

a conversation between a king & his premier minister

2 When we the people 20 Will
When the generation that has not experienced
War ceases to out hear "froad" of the glories of War
but know the facts & refuse to repeat such
history - when women too refuse the glamour of
war trappings, war music, war propaganda
& take intelligent stand in elections.
