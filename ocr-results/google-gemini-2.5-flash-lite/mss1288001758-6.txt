that may do for Sumner.
Just this moment comes the
little boy with your letter.
Thank you dear dear - I
sympathize with the pang
& I feel at Mr.
Brossons decline, But all
things work together for good
to do good souls as I -- 8,50.
Harry dear never mind, 
there must be something good
for you somewhere, because
you deserve it. I am glad 
the children are as good as
nice here; & hope they will
all Mary & wont
be sure on the letter --
Please look, and all of there
is any - Love to Mother &
all - But Most to you.
aff. - Sue.
