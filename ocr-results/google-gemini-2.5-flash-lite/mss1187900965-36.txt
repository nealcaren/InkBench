sentimentalisms? On what
could the Kenneth Rayner, &
the members of the Press expend
their eloquence?
If he proves Mrs Miller & her
steam boat, Mr Douglas & his wife
into the em-p-ass of a syllogism,
& prove logically that "United
States citizens have a right
to choose their own makes &
employments. Half the millions
speaking in this north country &
as to all privileges, I doubt
if they might be ended. I hail
the day when in the discussion 
of human rights - exact & equal
justice will be demanded for all
without distinction of race or sex.
With my kind regards to your
wife, & my best wishes for
your happiness.
I remain sincerely yours,
Elizabeth Lady Stanton,
