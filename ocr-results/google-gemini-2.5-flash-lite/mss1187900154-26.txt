My dear Mr. Douglass:
I leave for the East tomorrow morning, & how I have put off so
long my calling on you & Mrs. Douglass that
I shall have to make some
excuses to you for not seeing for me.  I remember
her with so much pleasure in Paris.  I hope
to turn to Chicago later in the summer & -
Then I will not fail to see you both. &
The meanwhile I leave you,

Very sincerely
Theodore Stanton,
26 west 61st. St.,
