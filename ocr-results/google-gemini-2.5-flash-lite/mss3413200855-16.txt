I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not
send my Check to the Cambridge
League for the National League. 
I am enclosing a check for $50.00, if
I have already paid will you
destroy this Check. My old check books
are in Cambridge so I cannot
look it up.
I hope Mass. has been getting
some rain, enough to keep down
the forest fires out yet been
deluged as we have been,

it has rained almost in-cess-
antly since early May, from
the first to nineteenth of June
we had fifteen days of rain.
Will probably be before by the
middle of July and will phone
to learn the amount of the
fund.

Very cordially
Zara du Port.
