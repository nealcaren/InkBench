her failures.
"I remember well how the silent prayers,

childhood to maturity, I realize that there was some subtle power

Victoria never had any doubt about being
a woman of destiny. In the same autobiographical sketch, written in
1895, in London, with her active years far behind her, she told of
a vision she had seen in her childhood days and the message it
gave her from the occult world.
"I remember," she said, "one night when all was silent, the great
old fashioned fireplace was sending out over the room in which we,
my sisters and I were sleeping, a shadowy light. Suddenly I saw
an enormous black and whole dog enter the room, and walking to the
fireplace disappear, whilst I lay there wondering what it all meant.
"I was conscious of the presence of some
living being near me. Said: "Come with me." We seemed to
walk out in the open air. When I looked up at

acted upon before the close of the 19th century."
Victoria was 14 years old when she contracted
three marriages. Her first husband was Col. Canning Woodhull, a
physician, whom she used to accompany on his
She used to say that this experience roused in her a desire to
emancipate women from the shackles of ignorance and to make
nity more intelligent.
After the birth of a second child she divorced
Woodhull, and as Tennie, began the study of law in her
father's office.
At 32 Victoria took her second husband,
became nationally known as a crusader.
Her views which would hardly startle the world now, were

out and brought in her cab driver.
Various motives were given for her appea-
It has been said that she wanted to open the avenue of business to
women, and demonstrate that her sex was as competent as the male.
Another version is that she wanted to reveal
ience the corruption in the business world under male domination.
Still another explanation is that she wanted to raise money for
her Presidential campaign.

Anyway the innovation upset the city of New York. Reporters
camped on the trail of Victoria and Tennie. Crowds of the curious
flocked to the office of Woodhull, Claflin & Co. "The lady brokers,"
were the sensation of the hour. Soon, it was noised about that
she was making of Commodore Vanderbilt.
She entered business, Victoria made her
dash into public life.
She prepared a memorial, an argument for votes for women and
presented it to both houses of Congress. The House referred it
to the Judiciary Committee and ordered it printed. Her
contention was that by the 14th and 15th Amendments, women were
citizens and had the right to vote.
On January 15, 1871, she argued her case with great eloquence
before the Judiciary Committee of the House. She was the first
woman to address Congress. She made woman suffrage a burning
issue, forced it upon the attention of the country. Ben Butler
was one of those she converted. He championed her cause.
Thence forward, Victoria became the militant leader in the suffrage fight. In the election of 1871, in New York City, with her
sister and others, she went to an election booth and insisted that
she be allowed to vote. Her militancy brought her into conflict
with Tammany and the police.
In 1872, the so-called Equal Rights party held a convention
in New York attended by 500 delegates from 26 States and four Territories. The convention nominated Victoria for President of
the United States amid great enthusiasm. She drafted the platform which called for limiting a President to a single term, reform in the Civil Service, an eight-hour day for labor, and prison
reform.
Her campaign collapsed, and was soon overshadowed by the events
which carried Victoria and Tennie into jail and the law courts.
The sisters had started their magazine, Woodhull and Claflin's
weekly. From the beginning it was sensational. Its circulation
jumped rapidly.
Stung by opposition, the crusading sisters had undertaken to
expose hypocrisy.
The story about Henry Ward Beecher had been circulated by the
gossips for some time.
In her lectures Victoria Woodhull had been discussing sex with
great frankness. "The Human Body, the Temple of God," was the
title of one of her lectures. She was, she said, the spiritual
guardians of morality. At one time hotels were closed to her.
She and her sister had difficulty in finding a place to live.
Finally she went with her husband, Blood, to occupy a house in the
Murray Hill section of New York. While she was there she was arrested for the publication of the
Beecher story.
She had sought several times to enlighten the public on this
matter.
She had given her story to reporters, and repeated it in Boston
at a national convention of Spiritualists, which elected her president. But the daily press would not print it. So in her magazine Victoria screamed all the louder about "Sunday School morality
and pulpit pharisees.
