Washington D.C.
July. 15. 1883.
Dear Grandpolas, I received
Your affectionate letter on the
12.th. and we were very glad
to hear from you, and know
that you are getting along
nicely.
Everything is passing along
smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times al-
most intolerable. It is now
about nine o'clock and the
thermometer stands about-84¹/₂.
Charlie has not left us yet - 
for the Eastern, by signs, and
I doubt whither he will or
not; I think the latter as
I don't hear Sunday any/¹
