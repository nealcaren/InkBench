Washington D.C.
Novr. 6th '67

Dear Father
Yours of the 4th inst. is just received.
I saw an account of one of your lectures in New
Jersey published in the N. York Tribune, and I thought
that you might have other appointments, not hearing
from you. All are well except the baby, he has a severe
croup; Dr. Augusta is attending him, we are afraid he
will have the croup; but hope not. I don't wish to trouble
your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and my-
self. I know your mind, and time is rather occupied. You
may know the cause of the difficulty, but I know you don't
know the whole truth, and it is hard to find it out under
the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone
against us, I look for another way. If you will be at home
any length of time I will write again soon, as I am
very busy just now. Lizzie would send love, if she knew
I was writing. Love to Mother and all.
Your aff. Son
Chas. Douglass
