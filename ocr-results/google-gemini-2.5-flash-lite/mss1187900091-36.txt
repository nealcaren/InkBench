New Haven, Aug. 15, 1890.

Dear Mrs. Douglass: Judy Sheldow
has just informed me that his
family had received recently a
letter from you, and that you are
in Washington. We fancied that

to address a line either to your
or to him.

I am quite desirous of hearing
how Mr. Douglass is and what his
plans are for the rest of the season.

as to when you think he will come
this way? We are all looking for-
