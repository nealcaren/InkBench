I am afraid your business
affairs are again suffering. Im here
not the party called out to cong
much with. "Nice & smart as smile
but "Can't keep a Hotel" & as I'm sorry,
think has & "Signified, you "Bus"
went for Mr. McCleary it might have
been worse in a different position-
You told me you would see me about
your Theatrical business at the next. I hear
you have "a Boy" (as it is said rather)
with your affairs & "micing thos Children
up". I thought you had a clear & business-
like mind. I have learned by experience the value of managment
Don't think I am scolding you only that I
feel slighted. I could do more for you than any
man in this business, or out of it for that
matter. Indeed (or vice versa) hum done it cheepfully.
