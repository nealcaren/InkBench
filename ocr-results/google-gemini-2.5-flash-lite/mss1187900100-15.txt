Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement foot here to move three thousand families out West. We are trying to making every effort to get up the money. In the name of God we call upon you to assist us & get your friends to assist. Now this will comes direclty from the cabins of the poor oppressed downtrodden & outcast Southern Negroes, if the northern people refuse to help us we are dead men without a hope. All we want is to get away from our oppression & then we can educate our children. We have sent out several letters to remote friends & we ask you to do the same in behalf of poor suffering humanity.
