Dear Mrs. Brown:
I can't let your nate about -
Mrs Blackwell go unanswered, even
if the charts I've ordered like to send
must be omitted.
I have always admired Mrs Blackwell,
and, in late years, have loved her
experentially. Her always beautiful Christ-
mas and Easter messages, and her
unmistakable spiritual force are such
lovely additions to the great background of her life work.
It wrings my heart to know that she, too, is facing a financial vacuum. There are so many who are!  I am one of them myself, in experiences I could share in making the fund which you are raising. Being a "stamp" outfit is a most painful handicap, in every way, but it is not particularly hard to endure, when there appears like this come.

Thank you for including me
as one of her friends, - which
I most heartily am.
Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett.
