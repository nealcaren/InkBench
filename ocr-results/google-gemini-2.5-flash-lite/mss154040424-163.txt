Six years; six years to observe the infirmities of American politics,
you have had, women of America. Will you allow any power whatsoever to steal
from you the significance of the vote you struggled so long to win? My
suggestion is probably impractical. The only thing certainly right about

were enfranchised. There is no touch of the need of rebellion nor
of the fealty of the people to whom such allegiance is due in such a place nor
is it here undoubted that the people is stooped so low that the
