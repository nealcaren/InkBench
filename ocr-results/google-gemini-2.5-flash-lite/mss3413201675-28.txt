TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double

BY ELEANOR ROBERTS
There are so many guest shot "swaps" on television next season that viewers will think they're seeing double.

Searching back in your memory you'll be saying, “Now, WHERE did I see Bing Crosby—on the Bob Hope show or on his own special?”

SINATRA SWAPPING
SHOTS WITH MARTIN
Frankie Sinatra is swapping guest shots with Dean Martin, who, in turn, will return the courtesy on the Sinatra special. And tax boys can't take a slice off Milton Berle is not only involved these reciprocal "visits," we with Danny Thomas who'll make hear.

a return appearance on Uncle Mil- All the network want big names tie's special but he's doing a swap because this is a season of stars. With Lucy-Deal, too.

With more than 250 specials scheduled the race for talent is terrific.

BY DICK KLEINER
BEST BET—Smack in the middle of August, we
selves the first football game of the season tonight. The
annual kick-off of the kick-off season, THE COLLEGE
FOOTBALL GAME from Chicago's Soldier Field. Each
cream of last season's graduating collegians meet the programs
champs, in this case the Baltimore Colts. As usual, it should

with Danny Thomas who'll make hear.

DINAH SHORE
Speaking of the stars' solid
billing, Dean Martin is booked
clear into 1962!

DINAH SHORE's new wardrobe
should really be an "emcee's"
She's been picking up glamorous
gowns from famous couturiers in
every European country she has visited on
her European tour.

DINAH stopped off with husband
George Montgomery and daughter
Melissa in Israel and bought a
beautiful gown in Tel Aviv. Leon
Uris' best-seller "Exodus" inspired her visit to Israel—and
she was a guest of the government.

With more than 250 specials scheduled the race for talent is terrific.

And the stars, fully aware of
this, are holding back. Where
once they would have signed
once they would have signed
are they trying to get maximum
exposure. On the other hand,
some have dropped out, like
Danny Thomas who didn't agree
with the idea of a second-class
star as host.

And perhaps they have picked
up with the idea of special shows
that are not reciprocal, as is the
case with the Dinah Shore and
Dean Martin shows. The former
swaps with the latter at intervals,
and not necessarily on the same
dates. The whole purpose of
these “swaps" is to get guest shots
with stars, so that the former
guests may get a return courtesy
on another quiz or panel show.

Breathes there a comedian

to be a dramatic star?
ly not, with so many of them
Wynn, Milton Berle, Jack
son, etc.-taking a whac
straight drama.

The newest one to join the cir-
cle to GEORGE GOBEL
who'll star in his first straight
TV drama on, in "They Like Me
Fine", next season.

Gobel plays the role of a some-
time night club comic who vies
his biggest laughs from members
of his family. Very Pagliacci!

BEST BET — The PERRY
PRESENTS gimmick—the al-
manac-is gradually being eased
out of the show. And, more and
more, the singers simply do
good songs without any attempt
to tie them in to events of the
past. Tonight, Tony Bennett
sings "Strike Up the Band" and
Jaye P. Morgan does "Music,
Maestro, Please" in that unconnected way. And there's a medley of some all-time record hits
which has no almanac significance. During this spot, Tony
will sing "Cry, Cry, Jaye P. does
"Daddy." The Modernaires have
"That's My Desire" and there'll
be a dancing production number
to "One O'Clock Jump." — 8-9
(Ch. 4).

7:30-8 (Ch. 5) -If your seismograph is registering some
tremors on the West Coast, it's
probably because the DICK
CLARK SHOW is getting ready
to do three shows there. Before
they left New York, they taped
the one you'll see tonight. Jack
Scott is the biggest name, with
Tommy Edwards, Rusty York,
Johnny and the Hurricanes and
The Browns the other guests.

8-9 PERRY PRESENTS (See
best bet).

9:9:30 (Ch. 7)-BRENNER
continues to find new approaches
for a police show. Tonight's tells
of a social worker and a police-
man, who have differing atti-
tudes about juvenile crime. Since
Lee Grant is the social worker
and Edward Binns is the police-
man, both these views are believable and well-presented.
Binns and Miss Grant, who have
worked together before, make
a good team.

10:30-11 (Ch. 5)-THE D.A.'s
MAN is repeating one of its better jobs, in which you'll meet a
real nasty type. This is one

matter how diabolically he is.
Both Conrad and Bendix are

Young Teddy—he's the biggest

10-11 (Ch. 4)

6:30 (Ch. 2) -An excellent
guided tour of the U.S. is provided by CHET HUNTLEY REPORTING, but there's a larger
purpose. It's a suggested itinerary for Premier Khrushchev for
his visit here and includes visits
to wheat and corn fields in Iowa,
a look at an intergrated community in Levittown, Pa., a
thinking machine center in Cambridge, Mass., New York City,
some Oklahoma oil wells, and
thence to California for an illustration of how a desert was converted into a lush valley.

8-9 (Ch. 7)—It's business as
usual on THE ED SULLIVAN
SHOW even though the headman
is off in Russia looking for
Soviet sword-swallowers. This
was taped last June and features Lionel Hampton and a
small group in some feverish
jazz. Jan Peerce, the Metropolitan Opera lad who also
