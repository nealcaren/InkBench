My dear Daughter, - Miss
mack came yesterday
and brought the box and
visited with me awhile.
She said she had a nice
trip up and working at
home, and cleaning away
weeds in the back and
the like.

We were very glad
to talk with you Sunday-
night. It helps Parks, feel
better. We are doing very
well at present. Brother
and family are quite
well! He doesnt come so
often now, is still work-
ing out at Jackson, and
help. We are getting welfare
and wont over work be-
fore you comes home.

Now that School is out I
suppose some of the Child-
ren will be over to stay.
much love from Mother.
