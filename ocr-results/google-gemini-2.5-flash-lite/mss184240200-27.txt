I know a D..... speech when
I hear it!! I wont take
his Opinion when I'm absent,
surely I prefer mine when I
have the same chance to judge
as he.

I Dont know why you
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter i'm my western
friend but I enclose a
copy-

Good Bye
again

with nearest

wishes for your Health
specially if you think of
facing the rigor of a
New England summer next
July-
