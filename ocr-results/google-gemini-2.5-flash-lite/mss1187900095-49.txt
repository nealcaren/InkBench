3 pursue, and I trust shall
have your approval as well as
that of friend Bassett.
Mr. Blaine has been sick in New
York for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get well. There
is much illness manifested in
his condition.
I thank you for long and very
kind letter, and regret that I do not
feel well enough to say to you
now all that I had it in mind
to say when I began it. But we
get worked out even when we are
very young men ambitious to run
a long race.
With my kindest regards,
Yours truly, 
J. Thos. Hothine
