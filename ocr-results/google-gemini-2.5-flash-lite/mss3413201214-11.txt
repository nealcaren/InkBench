Journal Friends

There is to be a Suffrage festival here
Nov. 14 and 15 and we are to have a
Woman's Journal booth -- Can you and
us any decorations and a large card
We have some "Newsie" Page - and it
have about 50 subscriptions blanks -
I've never done anything of this sort and
have little idea how to go about it --
But Dr. MacNaughton who is getting up the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of erecting a booth for the
Suffragist and of Mrs. Dr. MacN. said that
the cost of erecting the booth she would pay
it be used for the Journal the paper she
prepared to help - I promised to see to it.
