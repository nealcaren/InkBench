My dear Miss Dicksomâ€”
That you think that -- last week, have
experienced say in concussion when she broke
her little bone & Clara & much regret, yet
can I not think the responsibility there.
For rest all on her. My position in regard
to reception to other persons who have been
in as well known as the Salisbury were
other person - the city, and I can not but
regard it as having been a perfect imbecility
on the party your present. The blues however
have urged upon me to carry out her
resolution & to shun the water, & to be
very clear on public land lines. -

In the very brief conversation where
preceding Clara you expressed surprise
that I have not heard longer letters, & I have
had a deliver to looper further, since
my letter, has not been delivered as it
ought to have been, I have sent them, and
have now had two, and have come very
close, as I have seen them.  It is a larger
collection, having been for a longer
time of any letters all resembling the
which, as I have, you delivered last
week, and which delivered have not been
posted to Jerusalem. -- See how they
