department-but have not received an
answer yet. I expect one tonight. It has
been beautiful weather ever since you left,
and I do feel - think we will have a new
snow - but it will be keen and sharp.
Elizabeth is making preparations to lead
her lecture next Monday night and leave
us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.
I believe she has nor-made her - "leap"-
appointments yet - but I think today and
tomorrow 'fere will attend & it; "jute writing"
is a great deal of noise and confusion betwy
in the schoolroom and the few who have
brought their dinners are as full of glee
as possible. I hope you will have to come
as soon as possible and then you
will not return [homelessik] sick. Old Bloom
will have to keep out-of-sight for a little while.
The Governor of Missouri has a revenue of
$8,000 offered for his captured men. & David -
He has given himself up.
Mother wishes me to give her love,
and enclosed you will find a note 
from Elizabeth, and perhaps Annie
will send a few lines.

Your affec. Daughter,
Rosette Doughf
