(FORM No. 19-Continued.)
NOTE 1.
The company commander will here add a statement of all the facts known to him
relative to the disease or Wound, or cause of disability of the soldier; the time,
place, manner, and all the circumstances under which the injury occurred, or disease
contracted; the duty, or service, or situation of the soldier at the time the
injury was received or disease contracted, stating particularly whether the injury
was received or the disease contracted in the line of his duty; and whatever other
facts may aid a judgment as to the cause, immediate or remote, the disability, and
the circumstances attending it.
When the facts are not known to the company commander, the certificate of any
officer, or affidavit of other person having such knowledge, will be appended-as the
surgeon in charge of a hospital, the officer commanding a detachment of recruits,
&c., &c.

NOTE 2.
When a probable case for pension, special care must be taken to state the degree
of disability - as 1/2, 1/4, &c., to describe particularly the disability, wound, or
disease; the extent to which it deprives him of the use of any limb or faculty, or
capacity to labor or earn his
subsistence. The surgeon will add, from his knowledge
of the facts and circum-
stances, and from the evidence in the case, his professional opinion of the cause or
origin of the disability. In the case of discharges by Medical Inspectors, the last
paragraph will state that the "discharge was given by consent of the soldier after a
correctly described in the within certificate."
Par. 1260 Regulations, edit. 1861.
Medical officers, in giving certificates of disability, are to take particular care in
all cases that have not been under their charge; and especially in epilepsy, convul-
sions, chronic rheumatism, derangement of the urinary organs, ophthalmia, ulcers, or
any obscure disease liable to be feigned or purposely produced; and in no case shall
such certificate be given until after sufficient time and exam-
ination to detect any
attempt at deception.

DIRECTIONS.
This certificate will be made out in duplicate by the soldier's company commander,
or other officer commanding the separate detachment to which he belongs, and sent
to the surgeon who has charge of the hospital where the soldier is sick. The
surgeon will then fill out and sign the surgeon's certificate, and forward these papers
by him to the surgeon to whom the authority to discharge enlisted men may be specially
delegated.
These certificates, after having received the action of the highest authority to
which they are required to be sent, will be returned through the same channel to
the regimental, post, or detachment commander, who will, if
ized by the endorsement of the proper authority, sign the soldier's
last certificate on this paper; see that the soldier is furnished
statements in duplicate, and forward BOTH of these certificates direct to the Adjutant
General, United States Army, at Washington, D. C.; the
circumstances be given into the hands of the soldier.
