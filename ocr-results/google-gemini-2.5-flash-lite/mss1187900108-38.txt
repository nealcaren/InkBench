wider public of readers, - hope about one of your toes, who was ill
that it will have the good effect
of keeping the Negroes of the North
from deserting the Republican
party;- a suicidal step it was
be for them, as you’re strong and
unanswerable arguments clearly
show; these arguments, Coming from
you, must have great weight with
all people, - the Colored people who are the
ones you specially want to influence
by them. So though relieved
from office you are working away
with all your old power. I
hope that you are entering upon
the Winter in good health, & that
you will not run any risks by
travelling or lecturing till Summer
comes again. When you last
wrote you were in some anxiety

hope that he has inurage and recovery
that all your family are well.
I hoped that the book of
Mr Carpenter’s sermons - & a few
other writings, which my nephew
Prof. Estlin Carpenter of Oxford is
editing, would have been out by
this time, - but it will be fairly-
or later before it appears; it is
entitled "Personal & Social Cauri-
osity" & is prepared by a Short
Memoir by Mrs F. Cooke.
I am going, about the 20th Dec,
for a few weeks to my sisters
at Palakes. - I find it hard to
leave home,- but my friends
much wish me to,- & I think
it will be well to do so.- I have
now been about six week with them
