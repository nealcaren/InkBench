War time illegitimacy

ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS
IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%

"Evidence of Moral Healthiness
of German Race," Berlin
Councillor Declares.

Times, Dec. 29, 1917
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 12, (Associated
Press.)--Ten per cent. of the children
born in Prussia in wartime are
illegitimate, according to statements
made in the Prussian House of Repre-
sentatives in the debate on the vital
statistics. The Berlin Town Councillor,
Dr. Engel, in an article in forwards,
makes the statement that this large
proportion of illegitimate children is
evidence of the moral healthiness of
the German race. He adds, in the
course of an appeal for the withdrawal
of all distinctions between legitimate
and illegitimate children:
"Paradoxical though it may seem,
this great number of illegitimate chil-
dren represent a measure of the
morality of our people. They afford
evidence that, after all, the idea of the
family and the restriction of families, an idea which
the war with special emphasis bids us
combat, has not yet penetrated the
masses.

"The terrible fact, however, is that
only 138 out of every 1,000 legitimate
children reach their nineteenth year, as
compared with 512 in the case of legiti-
mate children. The death rate of
illegitimates is a convincing plea for the
improvement of the situation of un-
married mothers and their children.
There should be a uniform birth certifi-
cate, and women who were engaged to
fallen soldiers should be awarded the
title 'Frau.'

" "Wartime, owing to the card system,
is torture for the unmarried mother.
Every journey for a food card is a path
of thorns and a source of fresh mortifi-
cation and humiliation. In the cards
issuing office, and again in the shops,
she must again and again make con-
fession of her fault. The awarding to
her of the title Frau would remove many
obstacles and much mental torture.
The number of unmarried mothers in
Prussia, Dr. Engel' states, has now
reached a total of nearly 200,000 yearly.
