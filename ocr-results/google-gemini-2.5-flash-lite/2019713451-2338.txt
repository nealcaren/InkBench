Principles of the Capitals.

Give Special Heed to these Directions.

This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions here given take for granted that those on the cover of No. 1 have been studied and followed. In this No. the letters formed from the five four principles are reviewed, and the stem-letters, t, d, p, g, are introduced.

The Contractions used are as follows:— m. l., Main Line; c. l., Connecting Line; m. s., Main Line Slope; c. s., Connecting Line Slope; m., Modified; pl., Parallel; P., Principle; E., Element.

The Diagram on the cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths. The Diagram above the copy, the part made at each Count, the Principles, and the way the copy is to be placed in the lines.

SUGGESTIONS. 1. The only possible way of teaching Penmanship successfully in a school, is to have all the scholars write the same line in the same book at the same time.

2. The order of instruction is KNOWLEDGE, EXECUTION, CRITICISM.
First, KNOWLEDGE. Explain the copy carefully, and have it analyzed into its Principles and then into its Elements. Teach the nature, peculiarity, slope, beginning and ending of each element; notice the connection between the principles, and the combining lines of each element; call attention to similitude and parallelism of parts and lines.
Second, EXECUTION. Let them first trace the copy with dry pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing them to be very careful as to position, penholding, rests, and movements, which are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do

not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should be high enough from the desk to allow a holder to be passed under its right side.

Third, CRITICISM. Criticize the line written, by asking questions on each particular given as knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The errors lie, of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is a curve, it may be curved the
wrong way, or too much or too little; if sloped, the line is a curve. Then two or three of the most prevalent faults, discovered by the answers and by your own observation, for correction, direct especial attention to them, and have one more line written that they may be corrected. Then criticize these same points, see how many have succeeded in correcting them; and write one more line. Thus, criticize the execution of each line, and direct attention to the correction of fault after fault until the whole is perfected.

GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end in the center. 2. Every principle touches the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the sides of the oval written downwards; the ovals, the second and fifth of b and v, and the second and fourth of w. See Manual, Chap. III. The Connecting Lines are the rest of the curves written upwards. The Turns unite main to main and connecting lines unite in a point: this point is formed between two letters by their connecting lines; it is termed a Combination Line. 4. The line that connects the upstrokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are five ways in which they occur in the principles. There are six ways in which they occur in the principles. There are six of these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts. The red lines mark the columns, each of which is divided into three oblongs or boxes. The even numbers are used for the Elements, numbered in the order in which they occur in the principles. The odd numbers are used for the Elements, numbered in the order in which they occur in the principles. The odd numbers are used for the Elements, numbered in the order in which they occur in the Principles in the small letters; from them, all the small letters are made. 6. The red lines mark the columns, each of which is divided into three oblongs or boxes. The m. s. is 50° and the c. l. is 35° from base-line. 7. The m. s. is 50° from base-line.

N. B. Teachers will find our Manual of Penmanship a complete compendium of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tablets are invaluable for presenting the Elements, Principles, and Capitals, of large and perfect form. The Oblique Lines are a great help to the scholars in acquiring correct slope.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES.

COPY 1. KNOWLEDGE. The 1's and 2's are pl. respectively. The top of 1 is a little more than half across the box. Mind the slope of 2's, and the distance between them. Observe Rules 1, 2, 3, 7. Analyze P.1 from Diag. on cover. P. 1 has been fully explained in No. 1, which see. Its analysis is P. 1 = 1/2; P. 1 = 1/2 E. 1 + 1/4 E. 2 + 3/4 E. 3. Notice that the second 2 is perfectly straight through 2/3 of its height at the end and pl. to the first 2, with which the left side of the turn, and to the left side of the turn, and to the left side of the turn has touched the base line. Cau-tion on the left, or sagging down on the tion against making a broad turn by turning too soon, on the right side.

Copy 2. Elements.
The Contractions used are as follows:— m. l., Main Line; c. l., Connecting Line; m. s., Main Line Slope; c. s., Connecting Line Slope; m., Modified; pl., Parallel; P., Principle; E., Element.

Second, EXECUTION. Let them first trace the copy with dry pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing them to be very careful as to position, penholding, rests, and movements, which are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do

EXECUTION. First, trace the copy a few times by count, giving special attention to Position, Penholding, Rests, and Movements. Next, have one column-line written by count. Thus, "Ready," (which means place the pen over, but not on the spot they are to start from,) "1," "2," "ready" or "up," "2," "1."

CRITICISM. Ask questions on all the particulars known. Thus, "How many began in the corner?" "How many made not ?" "How many did not?" "How many made first 2 straight? Second 2 straight through"? "How many were the same angle"? "How many were too broad"? "How many made the top of 1 far enough from the curve-How many made this curve?" "How many left the curve?" (Show on the board what you mean.) How many made first 2 straight? Second 2 straight through 1/2? turn too broad? Too nar-row? &c., &c., &c.
