Concord June 14 1885
My dear Friend:
I have sent
you various portions of
my book in a "progress"
in form, not having ob-
jected proofs enough to
give you what I wished
take, just get & shall
soon have advance sheets
of the whole 650 pages
and will send you an
early copy. Have you seen
"Abel" it. As I get
back proofs from others
to whom I have sent
them, I will send you
more. Fobles will in-
close the two last
chapters XIV, including
Brackett, ae account of
his visit to Bixden Jin
