Jean fed us, olda attended the
League & W. Volus and Dodge family
among them and along last
night brought a blue dress and
received a caller.
I'm hoping the war will end
in the South East and that the Great
& their white petticoat will chase the
Nazis home; where at least one
will commit suicide.
When we meet again I shall
not be so clean as you are.
Sarah Mary, will need a "craft you will
be a shining woman.
Looking Forward
