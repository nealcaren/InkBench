"Party Clean-ups Are
the Crying Need"

Says

Carrie Chapman Catt

Distinguished Suffrage Leader

WANTED, feminism in politics. Mrs. Blair, sunny
tempered, broad-visioned and
herself is one time hopeful, confesses
to be pessimistic and discouraged about
women in politics. Her conclusions are
drawn from seven years’ experience and
observation in the National Democratic Committee.

She suggests that to stimulate the spirit of feminism the remedy is
the application of more feminism. I
conclusions are that the remedy is the application of more feminism, I
believe this is the sentiment of the other
party also. Mrs. Blair says there are
two ways only in which women may
become a power in politics and such
as she regards as essential. One is
by holding office and the other is by be-
coming effective in political organiza-
tion. Either or both calls for more fem-
inism.

But is the feminism a revival of some-
thing we once had or is it a brand-new
attitude for which modern politics is
yearning? Personally, while I agree
with Mrs. Blair in many of her com-
ments, I do not think her diagnosis is
correct.

THE fact is that when the new
women voters walked through the
opened door into American politics
there was one great crying need through-
out the nation and that was for a thor-
ough party cleaning. The parties have
not been cleaned yet and, apparently,
are as much in need of it as on the
day women were enfranchised.

Said Professor McMaster, of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, under the title,
The Political Depravity of the Fathers:
“A very little study of long forgotten
politics will suffice to show that in fili-
bustering and gerrymandering, in steal-
ing governship and legislatures, in steal-
ing at polls. in colonizing and
in distributing patronage to whom pa-
tronage is due, in all the frauds and
tricks that go to make up the worst form
of practical politics, the men who
founded our state and national govern-
ments were always our equals and
often our masters.”

SO the years passed. Votes were
given. Apparently, the laws were
enacted. Legislation was passed or lost
on its merits. But who would have imag-
ined into politics, men made or lost
in politics, were so great masters? The men
in politics and especially the women
elected have flow so high that it must
be a very high class election had an excuse,
and women could not be elected
with the men. There is a Tammany Hall in New
York, and a Republican machine in Chicago,
and Philadelphia, which is even
worse. Neither men nor women have
ever attempted to remove the dis-
honest use of money, corruption,
and indecent attempts to cover up
wicked things that have been done.
Feminism in politics and no mascu-
linity or out of politics can contribute
to American self-government un-
less it be in the institution of honesty and
decency in the administration of party
politics. We shall never be a great na-
tion, our parties and politics will never
have the respect of our own
citizens and their neighbors, until this
lesson is thoroughly done. Every
post-mortem trick, every over-expenditure,

(Continued from page 15)
every purchased office must be recog-
nized by all voters as a political crime
and political honesty must be made the
common standard of all parties before
any simple remedy can be applied effec-
tively.

A wide cry from women of all parties
that they will no longer support a party
that is dishonest, covers graft, or guaran-
tees profit to certain of its men, would
startle the nation and the world; it
would awaken respect where it does not
now exist. It would put the right kind
of feminism into politics and take out
the wrong kind of masculinity. Instead
of more women in office and more
women effectively working in the par-
lies, the great need is a crusade con-
ducted by men and women against the
possessive wickedness of their parties.

Suppose Mrs. Blair and her friends,
a Republican and her friends, conduct a
Round Table upon these questions:

Are women getting out of politics all
they should?
Are women giving to politics all that
they might?
Does politics call for more feminism,
less masculinity, or more decency?
When the conclusion has been reached,
there will be need of another Round
Table to answer the next question:
How shall the result wanted be at-
tained?
