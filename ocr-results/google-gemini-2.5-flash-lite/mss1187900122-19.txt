London, Sunday May 6, 94.
Dear Mr. Douglass: (
Your letter directed to Man-
chester has followed me all round
till it reached me here. I am in-
deed glad to get it. When I wrote you
I had not seen your letter to Mr.
Hired; since seeing it I know
from what he and others said,
that while they did not expect "
"gush" (may they say you the same
compliment) I do, in knowing you
to be incapable of such a thing,
still they would have. been
better satisfied if you had
spoken more positively regarding
me and my work. Mr. White thought
that since the Society had failed
so miserably and I was thus left
to vouch for myself, you would
not hesitate to vouch for me.
We cannot go thro the country
telling people about this person
al quarrel and why I am un-
accompanied by the persons
who brought me over. As the

best known member of the [1638]
race, a positive letter or voucher
