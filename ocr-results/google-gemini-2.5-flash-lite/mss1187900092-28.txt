St. Augustine, Fla.
Oct. 15th, '90.

Dear Grandpa:-

I have learned with
much surprise, That you are still
in the City of Washington enjoying
an extended leave of absence from
your post of duty, I am very glad
that such a leave has been granted
you, as I know that you are far
happier in Cedar Hill than any
place you can go and I only wish
that matters could be so arranged
as to allow you to remain in this
