ALBERT H. WALKER,
COUNSELOR AT LAW,
(Including Patent Causes.)

Hartford, Connecticut,

Jst, I of the colored leaders like
to announce to Deaugust court.
they will take &e the sympathies
of your best friends in the North,
the abolition of Slavery & the
prohibition of &uscrimination
of State Laws. Tthe extension of
the ballot to the colored man:
these are secure. If the colored
leader announe any por to for
not also punishing by law, tue
unauthorized and unpopular exclu-
sion of colored people from
particular private or office by
such as vote &c. treated of, it
will look rather childish. It
will tend to show that the colored
people can move for the show
than for the substance of a citizen.
