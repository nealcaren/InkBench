supper we all went to the woods
to skate and skated until half past
eight when I came in and
found Bitting down to look after
his horse. They all have broken
out for not bringing m[y] ska
with me, and if it is convenient
I wish that you would have them
sent with my other things. Imus
Cut the letter short as it is almost
bedtime and we must be up
at five o'clock. I should like to
hear from home since in a while
and I hope you shall hear from me
I know this is not as good
writing as you would like
but I am in haste to go to bed.

From your affectionate
Son Charles R. Douglass
