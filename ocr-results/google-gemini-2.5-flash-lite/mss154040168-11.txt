with enthusiasm.  May thee not soon
appreciated - more than you can turn.
I am longing to hear who is going to
Rome, her and when.  I am as ignorant
as a mild cur-puppy and I am beginning
to worry lest the mail I need to take home.
Panama after I have gone.  You have
been the best correspondent for your
letters are always there when I arrive.
I learn that mail is not carried by
this boat to N. Y. but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail, so you will
get this soon.  It is not for to Panama.
Please accept my collective letter
as one for you. I must go address mm.
"Doubt it to" Maybe she will deliver it by
air fare.  Lovingly indeed!
