February 18th. 1938.

My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to
congratulate the world upon having you in it all
these eighty years to inspire and lead humanity to
do its best to advance freedom and civilization.
You have been a recognized thinker and leader
in many fields where men and women are proud to
follow. My only regret is that the United States
has not yet had the courage to elect a woman to
the office of president. You have been my candi-
date for that place for many years. How proudly
we should all have campaigned for you!

It is impossible to express adequately our
appreciation of all you have done for men and
women of the whole world.

It has been a great privilege and joy to
work in the ranks with you so wisely at the head.
We all in this household wish you a very
Happy Birthday with deep gratitude and congratu-
lations.

Affectionately,

Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
120 Paine Ave.,
New Rochelle, New York.

My dear Mrs. Johnson,

A special-delivery letter, from Mrs. Stantial,
just received, requests that I write you the answer to sme questions
that she has asked so that you will recieve this letter before your
meeting, on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place, present, in which to-
place its collection when it gets it and must raise moneywith which
to provide a place and for maintenance. Because it cud not guarantee
these things to my own library and that of the NationalSuffrage Asso-
ciation I have arranged to place them in the Congressional Library
and they have pledged that this collection will be kept intact for
twenty-five years. Very many books, of small importan, will decom-
pose by that time owing to the quality of the paper and ink, but there
will remain a considerable library which furnishes the surce of infor-
mation for the Suffrage-movement.

The Congressional Library has accepted this library and is ready
for it as soon as I can send it to them. They are just completing
their building and are not cramped for space. I have told the Womens Archives Committee that my collection will go
to Washington.

The Congressional Library is only interested in books, but at
the Smithsonian we already have three, looking cases representing the National American Womens Suffrage
Association.

I have written Alice Stone Blackwell that we have no record
of Lucy Stone there and that it is very important that she should
be included. The Smithsonian is only interested in objects, not in
books, and I have some mementos which I will add to these already there.
In addition to these I have quite a personal collection of photogra-
phs of the leaders and of suffrage-activities which we are mounting -
with explanatory titles. We call "this the history
of the suffrage-movement in pictures. I do not know what we shall
do with these books. They are not complete. I thoug of giving
them to the National League of Women Voters, but they have much smal-
er quarters now and if the Archives survive I shall be willing that 
these books of photographs go there.

Mrs. Will Irwin, who writes a book a year, was paid for writing
a history of the Womans Party and also the whole histry of the Suf-
frage-movement. Both were so highly inaccurate that I tremble at
the prospect of anything historical that she may do. I do not
think that they mean to make the Archives a representative part of the
Militant Suffrage Movement. I am much more inclined to think that
it will tell a biased story of the Peace Movement.

I am not opposed to the Archives and have given a small sum of
money to it, but I have very little confidence in them. This letter
is confidential and comes at the request of Mrs. Stantial.

Hastily, Carrie Catt.
