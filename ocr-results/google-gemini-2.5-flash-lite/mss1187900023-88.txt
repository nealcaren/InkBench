in Belfast - thinking, however, in this City,
long enough to hold two meetings. I shall
not accompany him to Belfast or
in any part of Ireland. He will have
the field to himself. I could be with him
at Cork, but it will not be in my power,
I am now about to tell you something
which will make you think me the
most fickle of men - I have decided
to stay in this County six months longer
And I should not wonder if Mr Wright
should do the same. Though I am Less
with far less reason than I have to



justify me in Staying. I have yielded
to the consequences of the advice both
Mrs Garrison and Mrs Thompson
both think the present of most
favor, & I offer it to them, & for remodelling
the old-time feeling of this County
and bringing it to the aid of the true
antithesis to dictions, im Ameri-ca.
And each think it would be wrong for me
to miss if I have them decide to Stay.
