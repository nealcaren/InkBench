in the rear for the purpose to capture the Wagon Trains.
The Federals were commanded by Genl Curtis & Sigel. This battle
was fought for three days without any decisive result, but on the
8th Genl Curtis made additional changes, and at early morn
he attacked the rebels along his whole line, the rebels are mi-
stantly thrown with confusion and fled precipitately on all the
attack. The division of Van Dorn retreated on one direction
that of Price escaped by another, The pursuit was contin-
ued by Genl Sigel toward Reitherville, and by the Cavalry to
the mountains, the rout of the enemy was complete, Rebel los-
2000 killed and wounded also 1000 prisoners, among the ubel
dead was found Genl R.P. Callock, a peculiar feature in
this battle was the presence of several thousand Indians, under
the command of Albert Pike, their savage instincts were de-
monstrated. And after battle the federal slain, and wounded were
found to be scalped, thus renewing the primitive scene of
Panguinary slaughter, Union loss 500 killed, and 900 Wounded.
