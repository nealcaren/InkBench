Boston Dee'r 25th
My dear Miss Dickinson
     Your favor of
the 19th. Containing a draft
for five hundred dollars -
came safely to hand;
and I should have
acknowledged its receipt
at once : but it con-
found both Jennie
and myself, to all the
go even so little. We
are none better able
expect to contain so
as all events are 
my.  XXX. Many thanks
for your favor -
I have sends much
love to you & your Mother
Ever your chz.
