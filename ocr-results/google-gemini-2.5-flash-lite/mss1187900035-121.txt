I have back a most
advantageous Situa tion
offered me - viz - in Russia
at the expence of the Polish Families
of the duet - Rich - and I
accepted it. - I shall
have cancelled my
Syndicate for the Poles
which work I shall re-
gret - I refuss'd
this - Though it has
again and again, broken
upon me - This very day
I received a Telegram
from Petersburg - Vergen, 
me, to accept the Situation.
I was glad to be able
to write to Cousin
that I was engaged, &
in English, I am
rather not have been
long before, I should
have been sent to prison.
