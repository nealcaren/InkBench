RUTH MCCORMICK,
DENEEN SOUND
CAMPAIGN CRIES
Senator Attacks County
Administration.

BY PARKE BROWN.
Both United States Senator Deneen
and Representative Ruth Hanna Mc-
Cormick, who has announced her can-
didacy against him, manifested yes-
terday what was construed as a de-
sire to see the actual campaign start-
ed, although each has chosen the first
week in January for the opening of
real hostilities.
Senator Deneen addressed more than
100 of his followers-Chicago ward
committeemen, country town precinct
committeemen, and officeholders-at a
luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It
was a closed meeting, but later the
senator made public part of his
speech, a criticism of the condition
existing in the local governments.
Mrs. McCormick, just before leav-
ing for Washington on an afternoon          
train, issued a statement charging
that a "propaganda factory" is cir-
culating false rumors that she is not
a bona fide candidate. She said that
not only does she intend to remain in
the race, but that she expects to win
the nomination.

Deneen Raps County C. P.
"Since the election of 1928," read
Senator Deneen's manuscript, "every
week has revealed in some measure
the character of the misfeasance, non-
feasance, or malfeasance by certain
public officials in this county.

"The people have been deceived,
hoodwinked, and in part have permit-
ted unworthy prejudice to influence
their votes. In part they have been
influenced by small favors to them
against the law and the general good,
and in a degree by the cohesive pow-
er of public plunder."

"I say the people have permitted
unworthy motives to influence their

votes by tolerating the breakdown of
law and order and economical and
deficient government in our local po-
litical administration."

"The economic laws have moved
slowly but mightily against the con-
duct of public officials and the lethargy
of the public itself."

Penalty of Bankruptcy.
"The bankruptcy in the character
of public officials which has been ap-
proved or tolerated by our people is
now followed by bankruptcy in al-
most every department of government.
The economic laws are as remorseless
as the natural laws, and we will all
soon pay the penalty of what we have
approved or tolerated in our local gov-
ernment.

"We are to pay for it in high taxes;
enormous interest on borrowed funds
to conduct the government day by
day; impaired police and fire protec-
tion and the lack of cleanliness in our
city, in the public health, the poor and
the sick must suffer, and the children
and the youth of the city must be de-

in the past was theirs by mere merit 
of birth.
"Have I overstepped conditions in
our community? Political conditions
brought about these results, but he
deferred penalties are personal ad
affect our community as a whole.
"There will be no need to stifle
political conditions or create issues a
the coming primaries. Every one
knows the facts. The contest will re-
late to the personality of the can-
didates, their ability and experience anr
character. They will be judged by
their intelligence, initiative, energy,
and sense of public service. Our duty
is plain enough.

Senator Condemns Prejudice.
"In this great campaign let us em-
phasize that we do not intend to remain
in the race, but she expects to win
the nomination.

"In this great campaign let us em-
phasize that we do not intend to
enlist us em-
phasize that we do not intend to
phatize that those who appeal to the
prejudices of our citizens for votes
and those citizens who permit their
prejudices to determine their votes,
who are equally unworthy and merit
public condemnation."

"The task of equalizing the bur-
dens of government and restoring
government to its proper functions
calls for the best judgment of our
citizens.

Let those who vote for illegal
favors and for hire, and those who
grant illegal favors and pay bribes
be exposed as the enemies of the gov-
ernment and of the people."

Senator Deneen - outside his manu-
script also told his followers that his
group has made no deal on a county
ticket with any other faction or any
Republican leader outside its own fold.

Mrs. McCormick's Statement.
The statement of Mrs. McCormick
read as follows:

"Reports recently circulated in Ill-
nois by my political opponents are in-
tended to confuse the public as to the
senatorial situation."

B. W. Snow, vice campaign of the
Republican county central committee,
announced that the committee will be
called into session next Friday after-

WIFE DIVORCES
MORSE IN RENO;
HE LOSES PLEA

Reno, Nev., Dec. 9. - [Special.] -
Jared Kirtland Morse of the chemistry
department, University of Chicago,
and former architect of New York,
today lost a divorce action he insti-
tuted a week ago when his wife, Elea-
nor Chapin Morse, was awarded the
decree.

The decree was allowed Mrs. Morse
upon her deposition alleging that he
had deserted her during an illness.
Mrs. Morse was awarded $4,500 a year
alimony for herself and an adopted
child, 17 years of age, now in her
custody. They were married at Roch-
ester, N. Y., in July, 1910.

In his complaint Morse alleged his
wife had been a hindrance to his am-
bition to study scientific research, and
that when he joined the faculty of the
University of Chicago she came to
live with him, but constantly nagged
him. Mrs. Morse denied his allega-
tions.

GUNMEN HOLD UP HOTEL.
Two armed men entered the Kenmare
hotel, 5323 Kenmore avenue, early yes-
terday, held up the night clerk, Charles
and escaped with $50 and a strongbox
belonging to a guest, Miss Agnes Naile.

J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year),
Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and
Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), rally
to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked
beans go big with Cornelius-Barbara says
the hamburger bun is divine-Jimmy goes
hard for the soup and a big cut of that
spicy mince pie.
You are building a better Chicago-we are
