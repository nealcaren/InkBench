with the policies of our own government. The only communists who
ever made any trouble with Mexico went there from the United
States and were sent back by the Mexican government.

The agrarian revolution in Mexico began in 1910, seven
years before the Russian revolution. Professor Hackett, of the
University of Texas, an able and disinterested student of Mexi-
can affairs, has declared: "At the outset it may be said that
the Mexican revolution, which began in 1910, was as inevitable
as was the French revolution, and as the celebrated European
struggle lay in the history of France as a divine right monarchy,
so the causes of the revolution of 1910 are to be found in the
history of the so-called thirty-year Presidential reign of Porfirio
Diaz." I believe the facts justify fully and completely the cause
 of the agrarian revolution in Mexico just as Professor Hackett has
stated it.

Let us look these facts in the face. They ought to
silence the lips of those who would have the American people
believe that Mexico has simply gone mad over communism. When
Diaz became President of Mexico in 1876, Mexico already had her
share of large estates, great ranches, haciendas. During the reign
of Diaz, he disposed of some 134,600,000 acres of land,
some of it was disposed of legally and some otherwise. Some of
it was sold to parties and some of it was given to political
retainers and supporters. This acreage thus disposed of was
about three times the size of all New England. The average citizen
received no part of it - in fact, the small holders were
dispossessed and their property confiscated in order to enable
the large holders to gather their acreage.

From time immemorial the Mexican villages have owned
their communal lands, their ejides, averaging in area from
4,390 acres to 17,360. acres. These communal lands were used by
villagers for raising food and pasturing their animals. these
communal holdings were all that stood between the villagers and
Mexican law. But Diaz broke up and destroyed over 90% of the
communal holdings - a cruel, ruthless, brutal exploitation of
the poor people of Mexico. When these communal holdings were
destroyed, 3,103,402 Mexicans passed into a state of peonage,
working upon the lands to pay a debt that could never be
extinguished.

In 1910, at the close of Diaz' administration, there
were 834 haciendas holding haciendas ranging in size from 22,000
to six million acres. In the state of Morelos alone 20 haciendas
owned and controlled the entire state, while 180,000 Mexicans
were landless. It is asserted as a fact that at the close of Diaz'
administration 96% of the heads of the rural families were without land
and without means of acquiring land. So we have as the result of his
administration
