And sin wretched men with rage,
Did pray each golden word,
And with my heart I flew them on
To see my gracious Lord.

Again I stood beside the gates,
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed thing,
The Lord had given me.

Growing old,
The prison house in which I live,
Is falling to decay.
But God renews my spirits strength
Within these walls of clay.

For me a dimness slowly creeps
Around Earth's fairest light—
But Heaven flows clearer to my view,
And nearer to my sight—
