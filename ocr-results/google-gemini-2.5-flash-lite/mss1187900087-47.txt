"We shall have on the 19th a mail of the
"18th from Port-au-Prince via Havanna, a cable on

"Northern forces will raise the seige and
"retreat to the North, proclaiming perhaps

"of things will continue for months.
"If the Governments of Cleveland and Harr.
"now had acted in good faith in their relations with Haiti, this war would not have

will write to Mrs Douglass.
