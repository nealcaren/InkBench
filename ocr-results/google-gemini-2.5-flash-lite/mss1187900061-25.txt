Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 25, 1883.

Honorable
Frederick Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass,

I was ready our
speech delivered on the occasion 
commemorative of Emancipa-
tion in the District of Columbia
and I was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterances,
and astonished at the vigor and
brilliancy of your powers after
an almost constan(t) exercise-
of them for nearly a half cen-
tury in the cause of your oppressed
people.
