Nempa back on the farms were
talking in favor of federal milk
control in secondary markets. Dur-
ing recent months it has become low
apparent that state control in mar-
kets where out-of-state milk is im-
ported in volume was not enough.
Despite the fact that efficient op-
eration of federal and state control
agencies, working in cooperation, is
likely to lessen somewhat the need
for producer associations, there
should be no worry lest the control to
agencies would put the cooperatives
out of business. Control adminis-
trators have publicly stated that
farmer associations were essential
for the smooth operation of the
dairy industry.
It now appears that the revised
Boston milk marketing agreement,
being written under AAA auspices,
may never reach a final, acceptable
form. The various parties to the
writing of the agreement seem de-
termined that they shall not be
forced to concede an inch. In view
of the fact that Administrator Sam-
uel W. Tator has reminded New
England that the agreement is
purely voluntary and that he will
eventually tire in his efforts to se-
cure the agreement, such tactics are
foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow

Seven Germans were sentenced to
prison the other day for listening
to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two
of them having their sentences
lengthened to four years for the ad-
ditional offense of discussing poli-
tics while the broadcast was going
on.

To most people who have ever
happened to “pick up Moscow” this
will seem a high price to pay for
either the instruction or the enter-
tainment offered. But the same
would be true of broadcasts from
Berlin or Rome whenever these de-
sert Mozart and Verdi for the arid
wastes of propaganda.

IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION

To the Editor of The Republican:-

If the subject were not

which are constantly bein

automobile fatalities.

that the greater the power
the more difficult are the

the fact that the shrewd old gen-
man who occupies the governor's
down in Hartford isn't say
anything just now about “the
rizon” and “the hills” and “the
deal” may perhaps be ex-
plained by New Haven's Republican
mayor. It may be, as some
suggest, that the Demo-
cratic mayor of New Haven, having
a good record, deserves reelec-
tion on that as the chief issue. It
also be that the Democrats,
to generally suffered in the Con-
city and town elections not
ago, have found that the new
isn't altogether their best talk-
point, in Connecticut. And it
be that “Uncle Toby,” as his
admirers still call Gov.

the summer as making occasional
arks which indicated about the

But it is hard to imagine any gov-
ernment being put in danger by the
dreary stuff that is being broad-
cast in prodigious quantities for
consumption abroad. It would save
all the dictators much trouble sim-
ply to let the broadcasts cancel out,
assuming, for example, that Rus-
sian broadcasts do no more damage
in Germany than German broad-
casts are doing in Russia.

To admit, by police action, that
this is not the case seems like a
tacit admission of inferiority in this
kind of warfare. If Dr Goebbels
has not yet managed to bring the
radio armament of Germany up to
the Russian level of efficiency it is
time for a shakeup in the ministry
of propaganda.

American and French
Bombing Planes

The description of 24 French
bombing planes now being hurried
to completion near Paris and
claimed to be the biggest of their
type in the world, invites compari-
son with the United States army's
Boeing bomber recently destroyed
at Dayton, O. With a wing spread
of 108 feet the French planes ap-
parently justify, by a small mar-
gin, the claim as to size. But the
232-miles-an-hour average which
the Boeing plane maintained for
the nonstop flight from Seattle to
Dayton makes the French planes
seem laggards, 12 being designed
for a maximum of 180 miles and 12
for a maximum of 208 miles.

The apparent superiority of the
American plane is still greater in
view of the accepted understanding
that its Seattle-Dayton flight was
made with only three-quarters of
its full power and that its maxi-
mum with four 800 horse-power mo-
tors, intended eventually to be re-

spiring kind of suasion in its be-
half.

Italy sympathizes with the Brit-
ish who are forced to hold an elec-
tion at so untimely a moment, and
Great Britain sympathizes with the
Italians who never have a genuine
election. Is any country in a posi-
tion to be sorry for both of them?

Montana may or may not be
cheered by being told that its
earthquakes are but the growing
pains of its mountains. For all
practical purposes its mountains are
already high enough.
