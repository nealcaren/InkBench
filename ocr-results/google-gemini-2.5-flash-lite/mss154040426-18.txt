the motives which to-day appear to control Legislatures and
politicians, it would be this: "We admit the justice of the
enfranchisment of women, but we don't want women in politics. That
has been our sphere and we want to keep it to ourselves. There are
not honors and plums enough to go around now; we don't want to have
to divide them with women. Women, too, have a spying fashion of finding
things out which we don't care for them to know. They might not
approve of us, if they knew us better. Our machines are in-good
running order now. We know just how to conduct an election; we don't
want the cogs stopped by-a new class of unknown voters. We have
ambitions which we can carry, out if things are as they are, but if
women came in Heaven only knows what might become of us. While we are
in, women must stay out; when we get out, other men can enfranchise
women if they want to."

I think no, one who has labored to secure Justice from a
Legislature to-day will deny that this is the correct description of the
attitude of the modern politician. It isn't a new attitude. Men
talked the same way before they admitted the right of woman's claim to
the ballot.
