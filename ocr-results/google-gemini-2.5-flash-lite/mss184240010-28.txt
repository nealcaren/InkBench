else he would go & spread the story,
he had so impertinently & carelessly
told Annie. Among the letters that
still find Mrs. Caruthers' file, sent
in through the mail; I mention it
to call attention to the fact that,
she has included in it the $250
in money; which is down on the list.
I sent thee, of which thee can take
note, when it is paid, in crossing off
on the account. Annie pays two old
ladies called the other day, and
not leave their names, her said
they would see thee again. Also
that another one, giving the name
of Mary Johnson, called the other
day to ask "if Miss Anna had
anything for them" - I don't know
who she is, though Annie says she
has been here several times before.
My poor old German teacher,
Prof. Reese, has gone to his long
home - was buried last Sunday.
She will remember my speaking
of his failing health.
