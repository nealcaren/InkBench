I came to Boston in Nov. to
make a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the celebrations, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken, does
not break easily. I thought I should
see you here this spring, because the Seapens
said so. It has been a trying winter,
but Spring & violets are near the door.
Agie writes me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work will do itself.
But if she is shut in, she so hates
in-door "duties". That she frets, the harmeth
chafes, She has a good - practical man, to
keep her from doing unhearse of things.  Sainted
case. Love bless you dear- always.
      Lovingby - Mamma Leah.
