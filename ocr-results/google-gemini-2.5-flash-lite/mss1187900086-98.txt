Dear Fredrick Douglass
When we first saw you
appointment to Hoyti - and also has
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers was saying about you.
I began to clip and stick them with
the intention of sending them all on
to you - I cut "lots" of them. but also!
in the huge piles of Editorial scraps
they here all disappeared but these
I enclose.
It was pleasant to see the
appreciation which you are held,
while you are alive to see it.
I am not sure that wee are glad
to have you Go - We need you
here. 749
