The route of the parade was about three
miles long. The presidential train rolled
into the terminal station exactly on time,
and as it was sighted coming through the
yards every steam whistle in the city blew
a noisy welcome. Waiting on the station
platform were the reception committee,
headed by Governor Terrell, Senator S. A.
Clay, Congressman Livingston, Mayor
Woodward and Bishop C. K. Nelson. To

everywhere along the line of the parade
from the terminal station to Piedmont
Park, where the Georgia State Fair Association
is holding its annual exhibition, dec-

from business houses to the homes of At lanta's citizens lining Peachtree street.
Pictures of the President were seen on

every side, many bearing mottoes of praise
and commedation to the city's distin- guished guest.

12th Cavalry from Fort Oglethorphe, Ga.,
commanded by Maj. H. G. Sickel; Presi-

E. Baker, other members of the committee on reception.
As the train came to a stop Gov. Terrell
and Senator Clay, accompanied by Mrs. Terrell and Mrs. Howell, entered the Presi-
dent's car to welcome the distinguished
guests. A moment later the party emerged
and introductions followed. The original
plan to have the President pass the waiting
rooms of the station had been vetoed by the
street level by a baggage elevator and
entered carriages back of the station.

Mrs. Roosevelt and her escort departed al-
most immediately for the governor's man-
sion, on Peachtree street, where they were
greeted by a reception committee of about
100 society ladies and witnessed the parade
from that point of vantage.

The line of march was quickly formed and
the President and his escort started for
Piedmont Park. The marching order was
as follows:

From a stand erected facing the grand
stand of the race course, the President
delivered his address. Dudley Hughes,
president of the fair association, at whose
invitation the President was present, in-
troduced Gov. Terrell, who in turn pre-
sented Mayor Woodward to welcome the
President and he was followed by Senator
Clay, who introduced the President.
Gov. Terrell's allusions to the President's
efforts for international peace were re-
ceived with rousing cheers. Mayor Wood-
ward presented the President with a block
of Georgia marble, a memento from Geor-
gia's organized labor, prepared by union la- bor.

As the President arose to speak he was
greeted by the immense throng rising and
cheering.
