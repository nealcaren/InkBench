But it really seems that
I am never-never to have
what I wish for. 
Everything seems against
me-! I wonder if some
of us are really destined
to suffer - Perhaps this is
the way means of
softening the heart - true
sympathy- if so - of
is it better to be afflicted
for if it touches us to be
indifferent to the sorrows
of other fellow creatures
--let us by sad experience
what it is to be surrounded
by those - uPon whom
fortune ever smiles -
have hard-hearted they
are;- their coldness is worse
to bear - than the sorrow which
breaks the heart. -
