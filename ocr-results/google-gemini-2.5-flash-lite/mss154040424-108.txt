Following the example of all elders I want to give one
bit of advice, & I want to leave with you one fact which I
have learned as the result of my life's experience.  I do not
expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may re-
member the fact. The advice is that when you go forth from
the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to
become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from
indigestion; nor is it the idle fantasy of a discordant mind,
although these charges have both been made.

Each of you young people who go out into the world have
special inclinations, you yourself, you find some how, somewhere.
I am not asking you to be reformers â€“ that means giving up
your whole life to them, and all I am asking you is this: wherever
you go, make your conviction with you all the time.

There is a law of evolution - you have learned much of
that during your life in college. These are Some who regard it as a thing
like the law of gravitation and that it works while you sleep, but
evolution requires evolvers - men and women
willing to live and to die for their cause. So
wherever, each of you, along the line where your
conviction is strongest. Learn to think things through, to take
into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions of
those who do not agree with you, and of all things, take the large
and when you have found your reason, plant it
the little thing small. The greatest
secret in getting at the truth is to learn how to knock off from a

proposition all the detail which has nothing to do with the
proposition. When you have learned that one lesson in life you
will travel along the line of your convictions five hundred times
as fast.

You, the sons and daughters of Wyoming, you have the
immortal example of your state to follow. When, fifty-two years
ago, the young territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone
-- alone in all the world. In 1869 I was a young child studying
geography, and I remember my map with that great yellow splotch
which included Wyoming, and it was called the Great American
Desert. The granting of votes to women in some unknown State in
that great desert had little influence on the outside world. What
good thing could come out of a desert? But time brought influence
to Wyoming, and then the world jeered at her. I am sure there must
have been men who went as delegates to political conventions and as
delegates to Congress who had hard tasks to defend the attitude
of the state. To my mind it was a wonderful thing that Wyoming
took her stand, but that was not one iota compared with the
really heroic thing that she never failed to stand fast. I do not know in all
those years of a single instance when she faltered. The world
jeered, and still she stood. I remember long years ago, for an
example, when she appeared in the City of Boston. A man who was
interviewed by the Boston Herald always an opposer of woman's
suffrage, and, the paper quoted him, "the Honorable Mr. So-
and-So, and the paper quoted him, "the Honorable Mr. So-
and-So from Cheyenne, Wyoming, declaring woman suffrage is a fail-
ure, and the article said that in Wyoming, although the women had
the vote, they never used it; that in Wyoming there were such quar-
rels in the family because the women voted that there was no peace
or harmony; and so it went on. It appeared in the morning press.
Boston was very smug in those days -- there were few who dreamed
