A. b. S.S. PRINSES JULIANA,
Stoomvaart-Maatschappij "Nederland".

The stranger has to adapt herself
to the country and I expect this one
will be pretty glad when she has
finished "doing" India and she will
be the happiest woman alive when
she steps her foot on dear Uncle
Sam's California. Yet I am in no
hurry to return. I feel that I am in
school and i cannot go home
till my term is closed and my tasks
are done. Before coming to each country
I dread and dread, stuffing
myself like a freshman for an exam.
