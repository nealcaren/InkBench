Dear Mary: Received a book yesterday the 24th
gift this spring! If this book tells how to attain
success with a book when the author (would be)
has neither sense nor popular vocabulary
to express the subject matter, it will be most
welcome. Until I have read it I shall notRoom
whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or
without thanks as the case may! I am sending you
a tiny box of light & haven't the remotest idea
had them before, but my mild finds such
what any of them are, but m nil find out
If you mrne nearest I should hon given you
at gardenful of plants to from the greenhouse
at which will euther are in my garden or
give me teared little Blossoms. They would hon
been stalwart wonders in yours. When you
come, sorry, I shall take you to see a garden
that is worth looking at.
