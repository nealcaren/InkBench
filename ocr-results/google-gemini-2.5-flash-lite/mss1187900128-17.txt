I know not where to find pastur
for them! I appeal to your judgement.
I have ever been friendly to the
colored race, having lived many
years at Cape Haytien in the
Island of Hayti; where my husband,
had a permanent commercial House,
under the Name of Wilson, Laroche,
& Co. We are well known to the present
President of Hayti, as for years he
was intereste[d] in the purchase of
co[f]fee for the House, of Wilson, Laroche.
& Co. Mrs Wilson was also consul
for the United States, and the
recgonition of Hayti was effected
by him. From such find this Record,
in the State Department.
Be so kind as to write for us to
influence public opinion in the
favor of the colored people.?
Begging you to excuse me, for
addressing you, I remain
Very Respectfully,
Frances L. Wilson
