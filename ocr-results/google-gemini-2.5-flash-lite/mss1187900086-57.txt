My dear Bassett.
Soon after your previous excellent
letter, and before I could see him about the
Consulship to St. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, without
note or warning departed from Washington
for Bar Harbor, where he now is and it re-
solved to remain till October; at least so
say the papers. He evidently found the climate
of Washington at this season, combined with
the pressure of office seekers too much for him.
In my last interview with him, I was con-
vinced that time, toil, and anxiety, had made
inroads upon his health and constitution.
And that he must either take rest, or reel
would take him. For this, and other reasons,
knowing that a personal interview with him
would be far better for us than writing him,
I have not mentioned the St. Thomas proposal
to him as yet. The President, too, is so
much out of the city, going as often and
staying so briefly in the city, and giving his
time so exclusively when here to the members
of his Cabinet, that I have been unable
to see him since Mr. Blaine left.
It is understood here that no Consular
appointments will now be made in the
absence of Secretary Blaine, hence my progress
