Your rooms actually appear to
have been newly papered (or
painted) after we apply our ex-
clusive cleansing process.

Dear Madam:

Before you decide to repaper and redecorate your home -
why not let us show you how you may save money by cleaning
the old surfaces, making them look like new, for a fraction
of the cost of new work?

Whether it be PAINT, WALL PAPER, CALCIMINE or TAPESTRY -
you'll be surprised how quickly and satisfactorily all traces
of "soft coal smoke," dust and dirt can be removed byproduct
special process.

We will gladly DEMONSTRATE our process without charge, in
your own home — and furnish you with an estimate as to the cost
of our work for one or more rooms.

In addition to our Interior Cleaning, we do INTERIOR
DECORATING, EXTERIOR PAINTING, PAPERHANGING and
FLOOR REFINISHING. Only the best of materials is used — only
competent (white) workmen are employed — and our prices are
quite reasonable. All work guaranteed.

We have renovated many of the most exclusive homes and
best office buildings in Washington and Baltimore, such as:

A At the time I called on the COUNTESS OF WARWICK she had four children.
a son who was a war correspondent in the Russian army, a daughter who had
recently married Lord Helmley, a small son six years old and a baby girl
Just three months old. She showed me the photos of each of the children
excepting the baby, and they were all good looks from their charm-

"Will you be here next Wednesday?" the Countess inquired. "I shall leave

United States is new," continued the Countess, "that I am sure you would be
interested in the ancient and Warwick Castle is a magnificent old pile.
You will be in England again some day, will you not?" I expressed the hope

and his charming English wife stand out conspicuously in my mind as among
the most delightful experiences of my trip. Samule Coleridge Taylor was a 
great musician, to be sure. He knew all about harmony, sharps and flats,
but he knew many other things besides. He was a cultured gentleman who con-

died. Mr. Coleridge-Taylor's cultured and aimable English wife had a
little
voice which was sonorous, rich and sweet. As her gifted husband accompanied
