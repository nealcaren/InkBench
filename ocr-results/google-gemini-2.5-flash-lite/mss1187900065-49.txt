joint note which I will enclose, and
secure its payment by a mortgage on farm
stock, implements & household furniture,
The stock consists of four or five horses, two
1/2 Alderny.mlich cows, a few Alderny
bull, 3 Jags, family Carriag, farm
wagons, etc. - the furniture is in
good condition.  Farming implements
are required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at private sale for
$10,000; and in feel sure nice to sold
soon after Spring Opens, as it is worth
considerably more money.
They would not allow one to task this
farm of you but for the absolute certainty
of the security they offer.- no one
I do it at all, but for the emergency
of their situation & should the place
be offered at Mortgage sale, it would
ruin the sale privately, as you will
see at a glance.
Can you help them, in this, if you



put it? If you can induce so
inform me, I shall have the necessary
papers executed, stake them & join
you may name.
I feel, for Douglass, that
while on claim upon you is nothing
beyond your regard for their mother,
pleading is unnecessary. If you
can do it, it will be deeply grateful
for you will be secure in raising them.
Please write to me as early as possible
in relation too envelope.

Very truly Jamy
J. M. I. Sears
