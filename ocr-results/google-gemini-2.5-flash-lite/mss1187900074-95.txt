it seems like a twice told
tale to enlarge upon how
very much we enjoyed your
visit among us, and how
glad we should be again to
welcome you, should you
be tempted once more to

Here we are all quite well
but among some of our relatives
and friends, sickness and
death have been present.
A dear cousin of mine, Miss
Lamb, who remembered
your visit to Belfast forty two
years ago, and who was only
here to welcome you last
