Dear Douglass:


Here I am, away up in the
North West, on my first visit to my youngest
daughter, Adelle, the wife of R. B. Scott, who
happens to be absent, just now, in discharge
of his official duties, at "Sooyoos Lake", in the
"Kanagan Country", as they Call it here. For
a year and a half, until two weeks ago, it
was almost a perfect blank in my life's journey.
To be blind, is a terrible Calamity to any human
being. Since the surgical operation, two Months
ago, which extracted the Cataract from my
left eye, and then waiting for the soreness and
sensitiveness, to light, to subside-two weeks ago
I got my new spectacles with a Speccial glass, suited
to my left eye, and now, with the aid of that
glass, I can see almost as well as ever. So much
for Cocaine and for Science. Thanks to Providence, human discovery and Skill for my holding out so long. Nature has
Dealt Kindly with you and me. We may yet become
