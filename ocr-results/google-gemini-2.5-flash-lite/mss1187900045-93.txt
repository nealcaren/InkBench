bliss, & No farewells are
newly said.
I re-member you in much prayer.
dear Frederick dislikes strangers,
but - at the last, I'm
sure y that I never found
any dear Savior so much an
object of our purest
precions trials & heart temp-
tations & his appoint-
ments - I can
have gone through all things
realizing that "all things are
myst?" work for Good -
together for Good -
we reach you & deare
city; we shall be enabled to work
our way the
back in all the way the
God has led us to
humble us.  & pray we will
May our loving Heavenly
Father in
bless youthfull soul and
