insted of not being Murllia
Biskets I would try
send you a line. I hope
you will excuse bad writing
and Spelling as you will
find. I have seen Miss
Kriger twice twice since you
left. Every thing is going
on just the same so I have
no nerves to tell
you all are well at
home hopeing that
you are. Rosa is well
and sends love to you.

Truly your
friend
