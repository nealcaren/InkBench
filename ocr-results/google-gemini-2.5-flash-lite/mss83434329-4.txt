curse rather than a blessing. I would not, at once, entirely emancipate him from the control of his master. But it should not be, as an arbitrary, unqualified control. For that control I would substitute the authority of Law, which should be SUPREME. In saying this, sir, I do but carry out a principle which has long been dear to me as an Anti-mason. I have maintained, and still maintain, and shall continue to maintain, as a cardinal principle in my political creed, that, in opposition to all individual, and all associated, self-constituted authority, THE LAWS should be maintained in full and uncontrolled supremacy. There is no being, entitled to the appellation of man, who should not find shelter under the ægis of their broad and ample protection. In applying this principle to the case of the slave, however, I would not conter upon him the same rights which are possessed by his master; and, for the obvious reason, that he is not fitted to enjoy them. But I would place him under the supervision of laws made for his special benefit, and adapted to his new condition-laws which should essentially qualfy the control of the master over him-laws which should protect him in all the rights which he is fitted to enjoy, and prepare him for the enjoyment of those to which it would be a suicidal philosophy to emancipate him. Sir, we owe it to this degraded race of men to prepare them for freedom; to communicate to them moral and religious and literary instruction; to restore and protect the domestic relations among them; to teach them the duties which they owe to God, and to us, and to one another; and to build upon the foundation of a conscious responsibility to the government of Heaven and the authority of righteous human laws, a social structure which it shall be our glory to rear, and their highest earthly happiness to enjoy.

--But, Mr. Speaker, while I thus repudiate the doctrine of the immediate and unqualified abolition of slavery, I maintain the duty of immediately and absolutely abolishing the slave trade within the limits of this District. And, here I come to a part of the subject which gentlemen do not choose to approach, but which manifestly desire to avoid. In this I commend their prudence. The slave trade is an evil for which they well know there is no defence, and no palliation. I regret, sir, that I have not the means of ascertaining its extent and character within this District. But the fact that I have no such means, furnishes a strong argument for referring the petitions to a select committee, raised for the purpose of going into a full investigation, and making a full report of the facts connected with this traffic. I can, at present, only say, I am well assured that the trade is actively carried on in the cities both of Washington and Alexandria,* especially in the latter, where there is a large receptacle for the securing of slaves purchased in this District and the surrounding country: from which they are, from time to time, shipped to supply the markets in the Southern and Southwestern ports of the United States. I need not say that, what is usually connected with the slave trade elsewhere is connected with it here—the forced and final separation of parents and children, of brothers and sisters, of husbands and

wives—the utter annihilation of human life, and the slave trade upon the whole, has been a curse. But let me not be deterred by this, when I know it was the mean-and it was this against which their own people mainly directed. The question of the abolition of the slave trade in this District was not so much as alluded to in the resolutions, Philadelphia, New York, or Boston meetings; but in this meeting, and above all, the "extravagant use to language of the New York resolutions, abolitionists, constitute the burden of them

I have only to say, sir, that these are arguments, which cannot be refuted. I have that which I have heard from gentlemen from the North, who have had a liberal course of education, and who have been in the Senate of the United States. Sir, if the principles of this subject are so contrary to the genius and spirit of the American revolution, and that humanity is to perish, unless slavery, must be abolished, then they ought to consider, whether they are not also guilty of the greatest offences, and that the abolition of slavery, which is always to be regretted, must be effected, and that our people must be prepared for it. Are we to be told, that because the Northern States have abolished slavery, that, therefore, they are to be freed from the obligation, and the responsibility which rests upon us in relation to this subject? Sir, if it is an evil that is so great, it is also a sin, and it must be removed.

The gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Upham) has moved for the abolition of slavery in this District. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Adams) has, from his own lips, declared, upon this floor, that because the Northern States have abolished slavery, it does not exempt them from the obligations which rest upon them, and that the abolition of slavery must be effected, and that our people must be prepared for it. Are we to be told, that because the Northern States have abolished slavery, that, therefore, they are to be freed from the obligation, and the responsibility which rests upon us in relation to this subject? Sir, if it is an evil that is so great, it is also a sin, and it must be removed.

The question of abolition in this District, I find, is one which engages a considerable portion of the public attention. I find, that, the people who are concerned in this subject, have presented petitions to Congress, asking for the abolition of slavery in this District. I find, that, the Northern States have also, by conventions, and by resolutions, declared it for the abolition of slavery in this District.

The gentleman from New Hampshire has, from his own lips, declared it for the abolition of slavery in this District. The arguments which he has presented to this House, are such as might be expected from an advocate of abolition. He has presented petitions from his constituents, asking for the abolition of slavery in this District. My own constituents, also, have presented petitions of like character, and asking for the abolition of slavery in this District.

I have, Mr. Speaker, no disposition to evade the subject before the House. I am not disposed to shrink from the performance of my duties upon this occasion.

I have, Mr. Speaker, it is my duty, as a representative of the people of this District, and of the people of the United States, to examine the objections which have been made to the abolition of slavery in this District. I am not disposed to evade the subject, and I am prepared to meet the objections which have been made. The public sentiment in this District, upon this subject, is one which may not be easily overcome. I will not say that it is a sentiment which is entirely without foundation, but I will say, that it is a sentiment which is contrary to the views of the majority of the members of this House. Sir, I have no doubt that the sentiment of the people of this District, upon this subject, is one which is very strongly against the abolition of slavery in this District.

Sir, the gentleman has said, that the abolition of slavery in this District, will be an abolition of slavery throughout the United States. I deny, sir, that this is the case. I deny, sir, that the abolition of slavery in this District, will be an abolition of slavery throughout the United States.

However, sir, I am perfectly convinced, that, the sentiments of the people of the North, upon this subject, are entirely in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District. I am perfectly well assured, that the sentiments of the people of the North, upon this subject, are entirely in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District. I am perfectly well assured, that the sentiments of the people of the North, upon this subject, are entirely in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District.

Sir, it is my duty to give the subject my most serious consideration. I have heard the arguments of gentlemen upon this floor, and I have listened with great attention to the arguments which have been presented. I have no doubt, sir, that the sentiments of the people of the North, upon this subject, are correct.

We are not to be intimidated by the opposition which has been presented by the gentlemen from the South upon this subject. We are not to be intimidated by the opposition which has been presented by the gentlemen from the South upon this subject. We are not to be intimidated by the opposition which has been presented by the gentlemen from the South upon this subject.

I have, Mr. Speaker, no doubt that the gentlemen from the South, in their opposition to the abolition of slavery in this District, are actuated by a proper respect for the interests of their constituents. I have no doubt, sir, that the gentlemen from the South, in their opposition to the abolition of slavery in this District, are actuated by a proper respect for the interests of their constituents.

But, sir, I am not prepared to say, that the reasons which they have given, are sufficient to repel the arguments which have been presented by the gentlemen from the North. I am not prepared to say, sir, that the reasons which they have given, are sufficient to repel the arguments which have been presented by the gentlemen from the North.

Sir, I have been informed, by a gentleman from New Hampshire, that the public sentiment in that district, is entirely in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District.

Sir, the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Upham) has presented me with a book of the Bible, and has asked me to prove to him that the Africans are not men. I have, sir, no hesitation in saying, that the Africans are men, and that they are entitled to all the rights of men.

 Sir, the abolition of slavery in this District, is a subject which has been presented to this House, by petitions. These petitions have been presented by the people of the North, and they have been presented by the people of the South. The House has no power to legislate on this subject.

The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Adams) has said, that the Constitution of the United States, has no power to legislate on this subject.

Sir, what are the powers of Congress, touching this subject? Is it true that Congress is authorized to extend its legislation, to the high seas, even to the very coast of Africa, and to prohibit the traffic in slaves, under the penalty of death—while it is powerless to reach the same evil in the very heart of the Republic? If the grant so powers must be so construed—if there is clearly no authority by which the Government can act in this matter, then we must submit to the evil, and wait an amendment of the Constitution, which shall make it consistent with itself, and save the country from reproach.

But, sir, unfortunately for the country, the Constitution, through which we derive our powers, is not thus defective. The power to legislate upon this subject is granted; and that, not by remote implication, but in terms of obvious and familiar import. The 8th Section of the first article gives to Congress authority "to exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the Government of the United States."

In the first place, let it be observed, the power of Congress to legislate on this subject, is plenary. It extends to all cases whatsoever. The framers of the Constitution, in granting this power, intended to grant to Congress the full and complete power to legislate on all subjects within its jurisdiction.
