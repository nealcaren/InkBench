ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes
the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled
human status. One of her aunts was the first woman to obtain a medical
degree and another aunt was the first to be ordained a minister. Her mother, Lucy
Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college; became a lecturer against
Negro slavery and for woman's rights when such subjects were practically not
considered an indecency; and throughout her life was one of the half-dozen great
national figures in the woman's movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to
the woman's cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from babyhood in the widely
varied activities of her parents, which Miss Blackwell has recorded in her book "Lucy
Stone, Pioneer of Woman's Rights". Miss Blackwell was assistant or editor-in-chief
of the Woman's Journal for thirty-four years; and President of the New England
and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association: all her life has been devoted
to the cause of suffrage. As Miss Blackwell's eye was not personally in the public eye as
much as the platform campaigners. But her work of editing the Woman's Journal
and campaign pamphlets supplied the movement with much of its basic foundation
of information, keen analysis and argument. Among journalists she was regarded as
an editor of outstanding ability. In the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom,
vast information, fertile mind and dauntless strategy which through the years carried the suffrage cause step by step to final victory.

The instant the ballot was won, she took up the task of educating and organizing
the new voters for public-spirited citizenship. She became Honorary Chairman and
an active member of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.

In line with her family's pioneering interest in the field of women's education she
has served Boston University, her alma mater, as a trustee since 1907.

Throughout these long years her sensitive humanity has made her responsive to
countless other struggles against oppression. Roused by the Armenian massacres of
the '90s, she became a lifelong champion of their cause and by varied efforts to win them
public understanding and support she rendered into English verse “Songs of Grief and Gladness” (Yiddish), “Songs of Russia”
and “Some Spanish-American Poets”, — the latter a monumental volume of over two
hundred poems, opening to North Americans a new continent of literature. This work
she still continues.

Not without justification was Miss Blackwell chosen last year to receive the annual
medal given by the Ford Hall Forum to that citizen of Greater Boston who has made
the most notable contribution to the public weal. Now at seventy-seven years of age,
she continues her work with the same zeal and enthusiasm of her eternally youthful spirit.
Her tireless pen stands ever ready to aid the quest of freedom wherever and in whatever form it calls to her for help.

The atrocious oppressions of the Czar's government led her to active work with
the American Friends of Russian Freedom. Her warm cooperation and friendship
with Mme. Catherine Breshkovsky extended over many years and included the editing
of her autobiography and letters.

The struggles of labor have equally enlisted her quick sympathies on countless
occasions. Repeatedly she raises her voice against exploitation and the suppression
of free speech, of the right to organize and of other civil liberties.

Devoted to world peace, she has sought during many years to turn her talents to
its service by promoting cultural appreciation. She rendered into English verse “Songs
of Grief and Gladness” (Yiddish), “Songs of Russia” and “Some Spanish-American Poets”,—the latter a monumental volume of over two
hundred poems, opening to North Americans a new continent of literature. This work
she still continues.
