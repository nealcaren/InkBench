Bridgeport, Dorsetshire,
October 9th 1866

My dear Mr Douglass,
As our return
from our three months' tour
Through France, Italy & Switzer-
land, we spent a few days at
Woodcote, Bristol, before reaching
Bridgeport— and there we found
your most & welcome letter;  always
delighted to receive one of your nice, long
letters,— & the one dated May 3rd
was as usual full of interest. 
I trust you will have us more
such adventures as the previous
you describe as having taken
place in Baltimore last winter
it was a success that you
could uninjur'd, but you will
just be so fortunate and then
time, so all be prudent as to
where & how you travel, and
remember how very valuable
