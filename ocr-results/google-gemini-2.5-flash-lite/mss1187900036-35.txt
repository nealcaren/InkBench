Dear Friend - I expect
to rest. I look for no
home to pass Pasture  Labor â€“
Paves.  Tries have been
my lot.  Since I can remember
the Clouds which have
overshadowed my life
from its very beginning
seem to become less
threatening as I travel on.
But I do not dread
them as formerly.  You
may forgive me the tittering
of the storms of life - by
the thought that they
life has some resemblance
much yours. Beloved friend
after makes one happy.
With the midst of tribulation
I like to tread the
paths you are
treading, - I would not
have to Gettey.  Place

where thee I've  have seen
