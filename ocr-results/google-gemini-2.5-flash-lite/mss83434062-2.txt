fired upon to draw me into the street at
midnight to murder me and my officers
Saying if we get the officers it will not 
take Long to fix the niggers and with the 
most positive evidence that the train which 
was accordingly done and repented threats
to the effect that not one of them d-a nigger
officer should ever reach the coast when they
are to this short after I reached Newburg and
while getting my Capt. into camp for the
night I was fired at the ball passing near
my head, of few moments after which I was told
by a Colored man of the town not to leave the

camp that night - without a Strong guard with me,
as he heard the men who had fired the shot -
say that they intended to kill the col. of that
d-a nigger Rep. before morning that they had
come on the train from Anderson to do it - and
when at two o'clock in the morning a was awoke

order which I took up on our march to Charleston
and it is a notable fact that no farther 
outrage has since been committed upon
any member of the Keyt - as soon as I got
to Charleston I asked for a court of inquiry
in the case which was granted and in
whose judgment – I was exonerated from all
blame. But for Perry having larger the
thing it was brought up and I was brought 
before a Court-Martial and again honorable
acquitted by a verdict of Not Guilty and
again on duty one more pleasing
fact connected with the affair is that W. T.
Bennett – was the President of the Court –
and that he stood by me like a Brother
through it all. I was not at all surprised
when Gov Gerry came out – So Strong, against
me for what can a man expect from a 
man occupying as he did at the time
the position of Gov of South Carolina and Saying as
