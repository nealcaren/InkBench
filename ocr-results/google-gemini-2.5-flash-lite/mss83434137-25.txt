and many people have had.
May the lord grant you strength
& restore your health again that
you may attend to your duties
with vigor.  I have not dared to 
ask how you are for fear of
hearing that you were worse,
but I think  you would have
sent word if you were unable
to attend to your duties.  May
the Lord bless you & keep
you.
