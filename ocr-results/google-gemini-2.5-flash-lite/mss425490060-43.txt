he coughed and was very
near death when a visitor
to him, Dr. Biggs, ourst
our dentist here, said
he could cure him, and
put one drop of
turpentine on hi navel.
The he coughed stopped,
and he is up and about
to-day. - The doctor had
tried every thing without
avail, and at this cau-
not possibly harm him.
I thought you might try
it for your husband!
We have too few men
of the caliber of Judge
Terrell to love there, if
anything can be done to
save them, and I trust
by the time this reaches
you, you will not need
this or any other remedy,
that your husband will
be well on the road to
recovery.
