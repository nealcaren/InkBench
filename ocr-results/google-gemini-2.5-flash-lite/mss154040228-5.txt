Dictated 11-20-'31

My dear Mrs. Catt:

For six weeks today, I have been in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, afflicted with a fractured leg. Hope soon to be released from this terrible house of torture, and so that I can return to my little apartment at 609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena, Calif. Many friends are wonderful to me in many ways.

My address, my close friend Mrs. Lois Genkins, 1718 Oak St., So. Pasadena - who has all of me in charge.

Cordially
Henrietta G. Moore
