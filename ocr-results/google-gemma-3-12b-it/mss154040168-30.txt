My dear Clara:

That book is one I mentioned to Rosa. I
told her I thought the title was "Her Secret". I did
not know that was the title at all. It was a book someone
loaned me on a steamer about ten years ago. I do
not remember the author or the publisher and never owned
the book. You had better tell her to go to

Everything out here is dried up forever.
It is nice weather for City folks, but quite terrible
on farmers. It has been hotter than “banana”.
Sunday, August 26th. When I get her answer, I will let
 you know, for we are expecting you to pay us a visit at
the same time.



Thanks for the information about the coupons,
etc.

Lovingly yours,
[Signature]
Carrie Chapman Catt
President.
