Dear Frederick Douglass,

When we first saw you
appointed to Hoyt’s great also has
many fine and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about.
I began to clip such things as would
to them—I cut “lots” of editorial scraps
they have all discussed but twice
to purchase. Pleasant to see the

to hear you Ed. We need you here.
