JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III 

"Fifteen," a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1819 by the American Colonization Society, and named in honor of Thomas Jefferson. It is situated between 4° 37' N. and 5° 27' N., and 7° 40' W. and 7° 56' W., on a peninsula of the Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the north by the Atlantic, on the east by Cape Palmas, on the south by the Cavally River, and on the west by Liberia, extending inland from the coast from 10 to 40 miles. The area of the colony is estimated to be about 800 square miles.  The country is hilly and is extensively traversed by streams. The soil is generally fertile, but in some places rocky. 

Many streams flow to the ocean, but some of them have but few tributaries. The peninsula on which Fifteen is situated extends far into the Atlantic Ocean, forming bays and lagoons that afford cheap navigation to vessels approaching the shore and render the vicinity of the settlement thoroughly tropical. 

The climate is hot—the average temperature from January to October in the dry season is 76°, and the thermometer rarely reaches 80°. The rainfall is heavy during the rainy season, November to March. 

The inhabitants are of the Negro race; they have their hands and feet disproportionately large, are generally stout, and give an impression of a powerful race. They flourish well in this climate. The natives are mostly farmers, but some are hunters and traders. Their crops are cassava, Indian corn, sweet potatoes, yams, bananas, oranges, lemons, cocoa, coffee, rice, beans, sugar cane, tobacco, cotton, jute, sesame, okra, stink apple, pawpaw, igname, gourds, and kola nuts. Besides these, they cultivate pineapples, plantains, pears, and garden eggs—leaves that serve as a substitute for bread.  They also raise considerable quantities of tamarind, watermelon, and the durable Calabash. 

The vegetables in season are generally varied, the average product to the acre being about 130 bushels. The principal crops are corn, bananas, rice, lemons, oranges, and coffee. They plant cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, beans, and palm nuts. The most important article of commerce is coffee, of which 300,000 pounds are annually exported. 

They also have a fondness for pineapples, tomatos, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, a large assortment of pumpkins, lemons, and limes.  Cacao, coffee, bananas, lemons, oranges, kola, tamarind, tobacco, pepper, cayenne pepper, benne, gourds, sugar cane, limes, lemons, oranges, plantains, maw, tomatoes, sesum, pommogorri, paw-paw, gorunds is cultivated with success. The trees bear fruit continually. They have oranges and lemons. Some of the principal products are gourds, sugar cane, cocoa, jute, cassava, vegetables, bananas, ginger, beans, lemons, limes, and pomegranates. Their primary product of export is coffee. The exports of Fifteen in 1890 aggregated 36830 pounds of coffee, 2375.47 pounds of rice, 419443.1 pounds of cocoa, and other articles to the value of $57,000. 

Wild animals are plentiful. Monkeys are found in every part of the country. Elephants, lions, hyenas, jackals, foxes, pumas, tigers, leopards, wolves, wild boars, deer, antelopes, zebras, ostriches and parrots, are common. Tropical birds of every hue and large variety of melody, can also be found. 

The head chiefs have, in most cases, their own particular medicines and are faith healers. Secret societies are common, and the mysteries observed. Mourning is carried on for many weeks. I have seen men smeared with clay and iron, and women wearing caps of clay. It is customary to shave the head, and the lips are painted scarlet. The people are industrious and engage in farming, hunting, and trading. One frequently sees them making baskets of palm leaf. The people are strangers to the created Order of Society, and are disposed to be indolent and disagreeable. 

Women work as much as men, and very often for men’s work. They often perform the lighter labor, such as planting yolks of vegetables, while men clear the bush. Women do most of the spinning and weaving. High-born women entertain all visitors. The female children are painted with tallow. 

The women are remarkable and acquire great influence in the family government, and frequently exert a palpable degree of authority. They are careful and methodical in the management of their estates, working from ear dawn till evening.
