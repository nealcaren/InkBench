larnedly to be of some use to Lizzie. To be a "spare"
life to Lizzie - if I have
more life than is needed. Thank
West. (Wow what an effecta
this look like!) Sadly my
hand is unbearable - so that
it's hopeless to be at all
useful for a considerable time.
Well, I think I ought to be
at work this week! - that
would be easier than - than
the 25th of January - and
here with fellow workers. They
look happy – I have there here
with such cheerfulness and
hopeful spirits. Again there
are 9 weeks - then the 
Black week will pass – we believe
it will be mild for this entire
life & then - well, my husband
(or children) will continue to thrive.
