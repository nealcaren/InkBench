Dear Mr. Douglas,

Your letter directed Man-chester has followed me allround till it caught me here. I am in-censed glad of it. Then I sent him I had not seen you little Addi-Rick; since seeing it. I know from what he said & others said “quish”, “may they pay you the same compliment” I do, in knowing the uncapable of such a body for better situated if you had spoken more positively regarding me and myself. Mr. Williams thought that since the society had failed so miserably and always had to vouch for myself, you would not hesitate to search some. 
We cannot go through the country telling people about this poison at quarrel and why I am accompanied by the person who brought me over. At the race, a positive little of much [illegible 1630]
