honest desire for peace, for perennial peace, faith
in it, but on the other side the fear lingers so
much of the spite of the caveman, with its cratit-
ness, its caution, its jealousy, and especially its,
that the caveman’s side of the head to wear permits
it to bulge. And so the nation composed of these
bi-furcated-headed citizens fights bravely for peace,
but prepares for war, and that is the way we are
moving on. I am not one of those who believe that
all the arms and all the armament should be given
move alright. I only go so far as to believing that in
these preparations for war we are deceiving ourselves
and deceiving our neighbors, when easily, compar-
atively easily, we could save the money, save the
anxiety, save our self respect, by establishing world
peace.

There are at the moment four propositions which
have been made for the abolition of war. I do not
think that any one or all of them would be suffi-
cient to achieve this great end, but all of them
have been proposals of Americans. It is a curious
thing that today all the efforts that are being made
to end war originated here and that we are not an
active part of any of these efforts. As soon as
we make it ourselves. The first of these propositions
was made by Benjamin Franklin when thirty
years ago, rebellious, suffering, hating, distrautit-
ioners there were 46 nations represented— voted
common judgment and longed to agree upon treaty
for the abolition of war, and nearly every nation—
except two—signed it.  But being a treaty not
ratified by this government it is a dead letter.

The second proposition was made by James
Bryce, and in his later book he urged the calling of
a congress to consider the subject of armaments.
The third proposition was made by Andrew Carne-
gie who offered to endow a commission to inquire
into the causes of war and to propose measures to
prevent it. The fourth proposition which is being
discussed today is the proposition for an international
court of justice created by treaty, with jurisdiction
over all nations to decide questions of internationsl
law.  I testified before the subcommittee of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee in favor of this
proposition—and in that testimony I asserted that
if the United States should accept this proposition
it would constitute a new and important step to-
ward the abolition of war.



there. They were members of parliament. But this
perennial fear of the neighbors always rose up-
permost and all the countries maintained their
tremendous military preparedness and the minority
could never make them believe in this marvelous
change. But even yet it is suggested that for Europe
eventually it may come into existence. It was pro-
posed by us to it. It is a proposition for the
Europeans, but it is interesting to note that this
idea is still working in Europe and that it will
with exist. It is an arbitration court. It has goes.
number of troublesome questions, but great jur-
ists like Mr. Root did not think the court was per-
manent enough. It was too ephemeral and too
temporary in its character so he for one continually
talked for an international court of justice that
should be a real court, a permanent continuing
court, and so the United States made a proposal
there should be another Hague tribunal in
order that they might make this proposal. It took
place in 1901, and all the delegates made
this proposal, and the unites however there unde-
such there were 46 nations represented voted uni-
mously for his court, yet never realized for
the reasons that it could not agree to have some
matter brought before it and it could not agree to
compel any nation to obey decisions.



The Hague Tribunal: When the second Hague
tribunal met in 1907 there were 26 nations re-
presented—not all those who had been before—
 since then it has rendered less than a score of de-
 cisions.  And these decisions they were not binding
upon the countries who made them.  There were
a number of propositions— perhaps thirty—proposed
at the meeting. Of these it is said that only two
were adopted, and those also were not binding.
The propositions made were almost always offend-
ed, and if a country did not like a proposition
it simply said so and that was the end of it. Stu-
