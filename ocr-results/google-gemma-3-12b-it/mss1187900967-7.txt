were at your house? I never think
should you come, a fathers house
find me in very pleasant hours,
not quite much as I have on Cedar
Hill. â€“ I can very well adapt it to
the Clarion and County. I
note what you say of young
Cooke. I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
Feel all more loss this is to
know that he served free
like a new Trick. She
did a good deal for him that
is perhaps the trouble. Had she
done lest that she would have
released more thanks. Gratitude
is not a very common feature
