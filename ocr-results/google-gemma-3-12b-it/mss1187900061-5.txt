Washington, D. C.
July 18, 1883.

Dear Grandpapa, 
Your affectionate letter we received 
12th & and we were very glad
to hear from you, we know
that you are getting along.
Everything is passing along
smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times al-
most intolerable.  It is now
about three o’clock and the
thermometer stands about 84¾.
Charlie has not left yet.
For the Earliest Suggest and 
I doubt whether he will or
Not, I give the latter as
I don’t expect him today anyway.
