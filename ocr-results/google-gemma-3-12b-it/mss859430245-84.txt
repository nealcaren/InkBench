The Spectrum in Philadelphia is packed with NSA members as the organization holds its 24th General Meeting with nationwide representatives.

July 4, 1976, Pennsylvania: Thousands marched through the city first gates gathered at the 24th annual meeting of the organization Spectrum for the NSA. The event, honoring the Bicentennial, opened with a parade down Broad Street, followed by a mass rally at Logan Square.

Speakers included William F. Buckley, columnist and author; John F. Reed Jr., NSA director; and Congressman William S. Moorhead of Connecticut.

"We stand here today to celebrate the Constitution, which is the bedrock of our freedoms," declared Reed. "NEA's mission is to safeguard those freedoms by defending our nation against those who seek to undermine them."

The parade featured marching bands, floats and colonial reenactors. Spectators lined the streets, cheering and waving American flags.

“We're proud to be here to celebrate the 200th anniversary of this great nation," said Marybeth DeGraw, a member of the NSA from New Jersey. "It's an honor to be part of an organization that plays such a vital role in protecting our country."

As the parade reached Logan Square, the crowd swelled to an estimated 7,500. Buckley delivered a rousing speech about the importance of individual liberty and the need to defend it against tyranny.

Free food and entertainment were provided throughout the day. Families picnicked on the grass, children played games, and musicians performed patriotic songs.

“It was a wonderful day for our family,” said John Wagner, who attended the event with his wife and children. “We were so happy to be able to celebrate the Fourth of July with so many other Americans who share our love of country.”

The event culminated in a fireworks display that lit up the Philadelphia sky. As the fireworks burst overhead, the crowd erupted in cheers, and the echoes of “USA! USA!” rang through the air.

liams exclaimed, "Long live the Constitution! Long live the City of Philadelphia! Long live freedom!"

Mayor Goode said he was "proud to accept this gift of freedom." It is a reminder, he said, "of the fifty-five men who came together here two hundred years ago to give us the Constitution that has influenced the course of democracy around the world." Then William Ramsey, 
telling it "high and loud" in the city to which it was dedicated on this summer's evening.

After viewing the parade, which featured a great percentage of NSA groups, Frank Conforti of the Philadelphia Police Department remarked, "It's great to see young people with a clear look in their eyes. If all the youth of America could have the glow that these kids have, we'd have no problems in this country."

Added William Marrazzo, city commissioner for the Water Department: "I'm overwhelmed by the obvious spirit of NSA which conveyed the connection between very positive values and putting them into action. I'm particularly glad that my children were here to see this."

The stage itself was a huge replica of the chair used by George Washington when he presided over the Constitutional Convention, again a product of the stage crew. Around the circumference of the building hung window frames, through these peered the faces of the Founding Fathers, along with that of Soka Gakkai in-ternational President Daisaku Ikeda. The delegates, as were all dressed in the attire of the 18th century, in the eyes of the young people, often a clear look in their eyes. 

Both Mayor Goode and Congressman Foglietta showed up in business suits, in contrast to the costumes of the members. Once the New Freedom Bell rang to commence the proceedings, however, the two dignitaries were swept up in the tide of events. Congressman Goode, who along with Mayor Foglietta, viewed the NSA cultural presentation remarking, “Never have I ever seen anything like it; I have never, dedication and enthusiasm that you have brought to the City of Philadelphia today.” Goode continued, “I am happy to say, I'm finished with my thoughts.”
