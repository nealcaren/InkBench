On Thursday morning we sailed forth at an early hour after photographs, and I bought two dozen. We then went to Lady Machenzie's for morning tea. We found her with her hat on, as we that foot lotion has reached S.A. Later we visited the museum. Miss Cameron lunched with Lady Steel, who has married and come to S.A., but I dared not so do so much and rested at the hotel. At four there was a tea out of town about a mile. The Lady, Mrs. Davis, the wife of a publisher, sent her carriage for me and sent me home. She had a beautiful big home and the drawing room was of elegant size with a platform at one end. I never saw a room anywhere which I envied more. In the evening we had our public meeting.

We left Hartzburg the next morning, arriving in Durban about one o'clock. The usual committee met us. Never did they fail to do this to see us off. We went at once to our hotel where for 18 shillings inclusive we had most delightful rooms facing the sea. This was Friday, October 15th. After lunch and a little cleaning, up we went to meeting of the Club (suffrage). Then commenced the over the president, Mrs. Eyre took me to a shop where she recommended a dream shipper. As willing to do the work, but the material must be purchased from the shop, so the colors had to be sent for me.

After tea we drove out to see the pretty town, which is not so attractive as Cape Town, but a great deal more picturesque. We went to see the sea wall which is a very fine public work. Saturday we were busy getting ready for the Sunday services. We had an invitation to visit the Governor's residence which was very kind. I was disappointed in the grounds, not much to see. We packed up all our belongings for luggage was considerable, and I prepared a letter to my dear children.

succeeded and left the muslin for two more dresses. We met the ladies of the suffrage club for morning tea at Mrs. Roesmann and it was a curious sight to see crowds of men and women gathered at this hour for their precious cup. Then went shopping, getting back to the hotel at 1 for lunch. I unpacked further in the afternoon and Mrs. Eyre and Mrs. Buhr took ten with me at four and I was occupied with callers until dinner. It was good to get to bed early.

On Sunday I worked more my things and went with Miss Cameron to Mrs. Kerr Crossâ€™s for tea at four. She received us out of doors. We found Mrs. Jacobs, Mrs. Roesmann and some delegates had arrived at the hotel. Again I went to bed early, but first I trimmed a new hat.  I had bought.

On Monday the Convention began and I was present every minute to advise when necessary. We met from eleven to one and from 2;30 to 5.  In the evening was the reception, where I spoke and again got even with those who bored me. On Tuesday we met in the morning and in the afternoon we went out in two night launches to Zululand where among the trees and mosquitoes we had then thirty sailors that served as our guides, as it was a pleasant afternoon. That evening there was a public meeting at a large hall where considerable money was pledged.

The next day we went to see the doctor, Dr. Johnson, who had been kind in offering his services. I was pleased we went as he gave me a useful prescription. In the evening we attended a promenade concert at the town hall. I gave away my other ticket on account of feeling tired.  On Wednesday we took our luggage and took a train to Maritzburg.
