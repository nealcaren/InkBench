**THE TRUE NEWSPAPER**

**ALLEGITIMATE BIRTHS**

**IN PRUSSIA NOW 10% OF COMMON-BORN CHILDREN**

**Councillor Delbrcke's Warning**

AMSTERDAM, Dec. 15. – Councillor Delbrcke, in the Prussian House of Representatives, has called attention to the alarming increase in the number of illegitimate births in Prussia.  He pointed out that more than 10 per cent of the common-born children are now illegitimate.  The Prussian authorities are concerned at the alarming increase, and the House adjourned to consider what measures should be taken.

Councillor Delbrcke said that the present situation was not only a disgrace to the Prussian nation, but it also posed a grave danger.  He spoke of the need for providing greater facilities for marriage and helping young couples who were unable to afford the expense of setting up homes.  He added that the war had had a special effect and that the situation must be urgently addressed.

"This alarming increase," stated Councillor Delbrcke, "is particularly noticeable in the large factories and industrial centres and is a sad reflection upon German civilisation.  In some districts the birth rate of illegitimate children now reaches 20 per-cent.”  The minister further explained that the situation was one that demanded the immediate attention of the authorities.

**Evidence of Moral Weaknesses of German Race, Berlin Critics Claim**

“If it is true,” says the “Berliner Tageblatt,” “that one-tenth of all legitimate children in Prussia are the offspring of unions outside of marriage, then this is evidence of a grave moral weakness of the German race.  This is one of the most serious problems calling for a solution."

The publication, which is closely associated with the National Liberal Party, calls for an enlarged scope of the state’s intervention in the matter of marriage and family regulation.  "The state should give financial assistance to working people who desire to marry," it urges.  “And besides, it is of vital importance to educate the people to a greater appreciation of the sanctity of marriage and of the responsibility which it entails."
