My dear Dr. Catt:

I rejoice at the recognition which the Frontier letter brought through its committee has given to your friend. I suppose I am not interested in the sum of money that was your “prize” but the recognition is what intensely pleased me, because my mind there need have been no contest on this subject et all; you easily could have been chosen by popular vote if there was a way to handle it. However, it is a very fine thing and I am very happy.

I hope you are quite well and that there may be some fall flowers in your garden or there may be some trees which have not yet succumbed 
their summer clothing.

Lovingly,

Grace Raymond Hebard

My dear Dr. Catt:

I am enclosing herewith an editorial written by Mr. F.S. Burrage, owner and editor of the Laramie Republican Boomerang. Mr. Burrage opened his paper for the cause of suffrage during the legislative days and gave unflinching support in his papers to the cause of suffrage. he has quite frequently in the paper expressed his admiration for the way for which you have possessed yourself in the greatly looms.

Lovingly yours,

per a newspaper man and Madame Louise—
Homer, a singer, have no hesitations in 
mously debating that in this year, 1930, the 
American woman has attained a position in 
world affairs that is admirable, however, 
philanthropy or social welfare, Mrs. Mary Catt,
sister of Dr. Carrie Chapman Catt. 
Those who have the privilege of occasioning 
such admiration are, naturally on the nearer 
beaten track for admiration, but the occurrence 
of the remarkable visit has been a temporary 
blur on the western territory. 

Seventy-Two Years Young. (1930) 
Not the least interesting part of the story
of Mrs. Catt's distinguished service was his
own prominent part she has earned by two 
years. Moreover her achievement in Mrs. Ward’s 
work.
