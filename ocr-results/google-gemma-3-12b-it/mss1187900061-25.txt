Legislation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia.
July 25, 1883.

Honorable
F.D.R. Douglas,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir Douglas!

I certainly concur
with sentiments delivered on this occasion
concerning the extension of Commerce
town in the District of Columbia,
and was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterances,
and surprised at the vigor
an almost constant defense
of states for nearly a half cent-
ury in the case of your people.
