*Mustered out of service.

Instructions were given to surgeons-in-chief to relieve the medical department of the army of the care of sick refugees and freedmen, and aid Assistant Commissioners in establishing the requisite number of physicians and attendants to supply the wants of the sick.

It was soon discovered that the want of physicians and attendants, and the limited amount of funds at the disposal of the Commissioner for the employment of physicians and attendants, would embarrass the work of the Bureau. The medical department, physicians, surgeons, hospitals and supplies, and the ordinary incidental expenses, medical purveyors to issue to the Bureau medical and hospital supplies in accordance with the standard supply table which had been prepared and the indispensable articles for the use of patients.

These surgeons-in-chief were authorized to detail officers for the service, and to furnish medical supplies; receive receipts for all supplies furnished; settle claims for transportation; detail surgeons to tour in the different states and to visit and inspect the hospitals and other facilities provided for the care of refugees and freedmen and to report the condition of the service to the Assistant Commissioner.

The physicians and surgeons were authorized to visit and inspect the hospitals and asylums; to prescribe for the sick; to detail assistants; to prepare returns and reports for the Governor of the Bureau; and attend to all other matters that may be required for the proper care of the sick.
