100 TAMBO ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, “Strike two.”
“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered: “Fraud!”
But one scornful look from Casey, and the audience was awed. 
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain. 
The scene is gone from Casey's tin, his teeth are clinched in hate. 
He stands with cruel stillness as his hat upon the plate. 
And now the pitcher throws the ball, with a swat, and now he hits it, 
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.

JOHNSON. — Sculptors, Tambos! 
TAMBO. — Yes, and de activists? 
JOHNSON. — Artists, artists, Tambo! 
TAMBO. - Yes, and de activists? 
JOHNSON — The actors, Tambo!

And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere hearts are light,
But there is no joy in Boston—nightsy Casey’s alone about;
