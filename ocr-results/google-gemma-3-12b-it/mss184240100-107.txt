Boston Dec. 25th.

My dear Miss Dickinson

Your favor of
the 17th. containing a draft
for Jane Churchill's clothing -
came safely to hand.
And I should have
acknowledged its receipt
at once - but it would
amount both to leave
and myself to all the
do ever so little.  We
are now buried in - 
Rush to cater - we  -   
of all kinds we have
by Christmas.  Many thanks
for your Parker &
dear sisters and 
let you & your Mother
be well - this

Affectionately
