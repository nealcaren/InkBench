rather than a blessing. I would not, sir, I would not, sire, - reiterate another attribution of all the absorbing relations of humanity - life, and the substitution of the vague relations for all the necessary and the specific regulations for the administration of colonial governments.  States assume to enter into obligations to be fulfilled…but if a law is enacted to establish a new theory, a new power, a new institution, to be upheld for the first time, I ask, Sir, shall this be permitted to descend to the lowest order of men?  Sir, sir, I hold it to be a fatal error to extend the exercise of rights to those who are not competent to exercise them.  The great difficulty lies in the constant change of men.  A majority of the people are not capable of understanding such matters.  A man may be capable of a brilliant idea, but that will not make him a fit administrator.

Normal men – men and women who are anxious for a few advantages will be the first to clamor for an elevated position, and those who are inclined to resist will be sacrificed.  I am more than inclined to believe it will be an exercise of slavery; it is the only thing that will be sustained at the North.  How is it furnished in the proceedings at which society is to be overthrown?  A few unreflecting individuals, who talk of slavery and its evils, but who are interested in the destruction of society and the overturning of our political institutions and the establishment of a community of equals; in other words, the destruction of society, and the abandonment of all distinction.  There are but few who are interested in anything, who do not regard it as their privilege to acquire that which belongs to others.  

These are the agents who propose to overturn the old order - who preach new theories, and for what purpose?  To make it cheaper to break the law - to enable men to commit crimes and escape punishment - to bring to an end all the safeguards of society.  The true republican spirit is that which recognizes the equality of men and the responsibility of each to the other, - that which encourages men to study, - to persevere, - to improve themselves, - and to elevate themselves by their own efforts.   To deprive the citizen of the right to property, is to deprive him of his own responsibility. The best means to protect the individual is to guarantee him the right to property which is essential to the maintenance of liberty and the safety of the people.

This is an assertion which cannot be disputed. The question concerning the power of government to regulate the interior concerns of the several states, has been repeatedly decided by the general government, has been repeatedly confirmed by law. * * * there exist certain facts which all sober minds should regard. It is the fact that the doctrine of abolition of slavery is spreading in the United States... that it is attracting supporters from all kinds of people.  It is the fact that the number of slaves in the United States is ever increasing, and that it is constantly becoming more important to the welfare of the nation.  


Sir, let me put to you this simple question: Are we absolutely, unequivocally to be bound by this precedent?  I venture to say, no; we are bound only by the common conscience; by what is approved and sustained by public opinion. * * * We may now proceed to consider our most serious question. There are some of us who are concerned with the question, of the right to exercise a power to exclude the slaveholder from the territories of the entire nation.



Let us proceed to discuss the details of this arrangement. It is not a question of sentiment, it is not a question of compassion, it is a question of the safety of the republic, which is a question concerning exclusively the people of this District; that the people of this District are to be left entirely without protection, that the constitution is broken, that the integrity of the nation is broken and that the stability of the people are broken and that slavery is to be maintained upon our own shores.



"Sir, the questions of equality, of liberty, and of order are not simply theoretical; they are practical. One of the highest duties of the government is to sustain and to promote the order of society - to render the lives of the citizen safe. * * * There is a certain enthusiasm... there is a certain impatience... there is a certain impatience, particularly, in those who are not accustomed to the labor of the ordinary trades. There is nothing more easy than to deceive; nothing more terrible than to be deceived.




Sir, I see what appears to me to be a great danger in attempting all-powerful reforms so suddenly, to break the delicate traditions of the republic, to plunge the people into such disorder that they cannot see how to act. * * * it will be to destroy order and order to introduce a permanent, revolutionary upheaval in the public mind. I beg, sir, the consideration of his committee, with reference to this topic.





"We are not bound by an unalterable and inflexible policy, but we are free to change our views. All our political institutions and institutions of society will be abolished. We do not need to destroy – we can maintain order. I beg thee, by God, to consider not only those which are being carried on in the city of Washington, but those which are also going on in other districts of the nation.



There are those who say we are in a decline. There are those who say we are descending into anarchy. I say, we are growing stronger and stronger. It is a question of principle alone.




Sir, the only means wherewith we retain our order will depend absolutely upon public opinion. Are we prepared for the adoption of a doctrine... that requires for its adoption the conversion of the nation? No sir, it could not be done!



Sir, the first means wherewith we are to retain order, is to preserve our institutions. The best protection to free men is to see that an intelligent, virtuous and law-abiding people will obey the law!
