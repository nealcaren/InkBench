THE CAREER

OF THE

GOD-IDEA IN HISTORY.

BY HUDSON TUTTLE,
AUTHOR OF “ARCANA OF NATURE,” “ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY
OF MAN,” ETC.

Dwelling in the light that no man can approach unto. . . Canst thou
by searching find out God? . . . Touching the Almighty, we cannot find
him out. – BIBLE.

Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.

SHAKESPEARE.
