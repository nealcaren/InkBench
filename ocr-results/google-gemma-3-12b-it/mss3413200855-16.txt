I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not
send my check to the Cambridge
league for the National league.
I am enclosing a check for $5.00, if
I have already paid will you
destroy this check. My old cheek book
live in Cambridge so I cannot
both it up. 
I hope Mrs. has been getting
some rain, enough to keep down
the forest fires but not been
deluged as we have been,

It has rained almost incessantly
the past since early May, from
we had fifteen days of rain.
Will probably be broke by the
middle of July and will phone
to learn the amount of the
June.

Very cordially
Zara du Pont
