Dear Mrs. Osborn:

I can't let your note unacknowledged, even
if the check I wanted to send
meant the omission.

I have always admired Miss Blackwell,
and in late years, beautiful, crisp-
ness of her manner, and her
undeniable spiritual face are such
sweet additions to the great back-
ground of her life work.

It stumps my heart to learn that-
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.
There are so many who are - I am one
of them myself, or of course I would
share in making the funnel which
are rafting.  I am a stamp artist,
as one of the painful handicaps,
in every way, but it is in particularly
hard to endure, when appeals like
this come.

Thank you for including me
as one of your friends - while
I must heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett.
