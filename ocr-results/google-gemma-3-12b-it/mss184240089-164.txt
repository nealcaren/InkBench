if you will but keep
the size of your own
spirit turned within -
for it is there within
(not without) that the
true precious jewel of
truth & bright is to
be sought - & found -
and claried - yes
will find it, & health
if and time it - and
all men & women will
see your lesson -
heartfelt & so dear, 
Queen of all.
