(sort of theatre which consists of pantomime done to the recitation of the old Hanamous of the Hindoo.
When pantomime is acted by men it is Wang-Chi-fang.
[?] When the people put on masks for the part it
is Wang Wong, see postal 42. It is also done with
dolls, in which case they see them as shadows, manipulating
them behind a curtain. 

I must return to the Sultan’s Palace to record that under a 
small shed was a nice grandfather clock, and above a neighboring 
shed was a large bell. This rope leading into the small shed.

Two men were watching day and night by the side of the clock, and 
every hour they rang the bell. Thus the centuries old custom 
of ringing the bell is continued, but it is done with scientific 
accuracy. 

The most astute thing I have heard of in connection with 
colonial affairs was done by the Dutch here, nor is it a bit 
more unprincipled than a thousand other instances of the way 
Europeans got the upper hand in Asiatic countries. There was 
a somewhat powerful kingdom - the real heart of the Hindoo, so 
the kingdom is succeeded to have been ruled by the Effendi, 

long ago no one can name the date, and calls named Sultan, which 
means an authority. A sultan presumed over its territory, dotted 
long as a Chinese hill wandering waters to attack it. At all 
events the territory was so extensive that it would take a man 
ten days to help to, which is curious, but it is done with scientific 
accuracy. 

Now the Dutch, who were practical men, discovered that the 
country was very rich in pepper, which at that time was quite 
valuable. They did not attack the country. They did not waste 
money in making war. They simply hired all the coolies they 
could get at a dollar a month, and in one year they collected 
enough pepper to pay for all the men and all the equipment.

I’ve found in Java, and I bought some photos and postals of 
Javanese. See postals No. 26 to 31, and pictures large, No. 
31, 32 & 33, small No. 34 to 40. After lunch we rested and I 
read up some more temples we are to see tomorrow. At 
5:30 we rigged up our best and a grand “tailored” as the 
big carriages are called and going to see the Prince, for the 
Sultan has a sort of guarded called a Prince, not so high as the 
Sultan, but a royalty. We had a letter to him from Dr. LaFonten 
of Buitenzorg. He is a little interested in philosophy. 

He lives in a fine palace with an immense marble floor verandah 
where we were received by the Prince, his uncle, 14 rooms between 
our four sisters. He is a young man and is the "son" of the 
Sultan. He is liberal, but he would not let his sisters 
could go to school. It is a curious fact that the sultan's 
wife and sons and only with symptoms. The princesses were brought 
in to show us, some of these were ugly as men are.
