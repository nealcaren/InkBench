Martha's Vineyard, Mass. September 18, 1920.

Miss Alice Stone Blackwell
Dear Miss Blackwell:

Summer has come to a sudden end and it is cooling off so fast that I suppose you will be creeping back to Boston soon.

I have now received a copy of your book. It is issued with excellent taste and I think it is just the right size for a biography.

I thank you most emphatically for the explanations you have made in your letter, regarding Mrs. Dorr’s Life of Miss Anthony and, of course, her own written in order to say that there never had been but two suffragists counting Blatch and Miss Paul. I happened to meet Harriet Stanton Blatch at the Women's Auxiliary. I spoke to her and asked if she had read Miss Dorr’s book. She said “no.” I told her I thought Miss Dorr had given her mother a rough hard whack. She smiled a little, but looked as though she had no intention of reading that biography.

I think there were some mysteries within the National wing about which I have received no hint. It has been my own notion that Mrs. Blatch hated Miss Anthony, because she was a friend of her mother’s. She did not make the fact public. Of course I never came in contact with Mrs. Stanton, I had barely met her and had taken lunch at her house once or twice. I never liked nor admired her, although I had thought she had a well-beautifully pen and that some of her suffrage statements were beautifully constructed. I believe that Miss Anthony always thought she could exceed anyone else in style and strength of her appeal and that she clung to her. 

I I always thought it was just people that she may have been other reasons. I always thought in strange with Mrs. Stanton, the influence of Mrs. Stanton. It always seemed to me that Mrs. Stanton had things because Mrs. Stanton indicated that that was the way to do them. By the time I met and the movement thought and practically gone out and yet, despite that fact, Miss Anthony never entirely recovered her independence and freedom from her influence. I have always doubted whether it was simple a woman and devotion or if she really desired freedom.
