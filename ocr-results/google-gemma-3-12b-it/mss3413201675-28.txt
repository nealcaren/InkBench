**TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double**

By ELEANOR ROBERTS
There are so many, many times when viewers will think they're seeing double! TV is about to get into a dizzy new game – swapping stars!

Searching back in your memory you’ll be saying, “Now, WHERE did I see Bing Crosby-on the Bob Hope show?”
BINATA SWAPPING

DONNA with the one, that’s just fine! Here’s how it’ll work: a change of careers and of cast. At first, it’ll be a matter of a slight bit of confusion - the sudden appearance of Bob Hope’s long-time TV partner, Lucille Ball, as a guest “star” on the Phil Silvers show. Then you’ll be wondering, "Where did I see Dinah Shore in - on the Jack Benny show?"

The plan, as explained to me by several studio executives, is to give viewers a taste of what life must be like for a comedian who has to be everything, all the time.   The idea is to allow studio stars to have some varied roles. They can try new things but still get the benefit of showing a TV audience something new - their association with a known show.

That’s what's happening now - so plan to be pleasantly surprised.

I ask you, can you imagine how Phil Silpers might act when, out of the blue, Lucille Ball walks in with a line or two. Don't even get me started about Jack Benny's antics when Dinah walks through his television door.

But that isn’t all. Look for the swapping to accelerate and become more involved. One studio executive already mentioned the possibility of Lucille Ball becoming a permanent, unofficial co-star of “The Phil Silvers Show." He’s also thinking of another switch: Donna Reed of "The Donna Reed Show" starring on "I Love Lucy."

This, he explained, would take a little more planning and some rewrites.  But, as he said, the most brilliant thing would be for Lucille Ball to portray Donna Reed’s children.
“It’d give the characters a real depth,” he claimed.

"It's the greatest thing ever to happen to the viewers,” he decided.
