"Party Clean-ups Are
the Crying Need"

Says Carrie Chapman Catt

Distinguished Suffrage Leader

WANTED, feminism in politics that has happened in one party has also occurred in the other. Mrs. Blair says so. Mrs. Emily Newell Blair, a tempered, broad-visioned, and one time hopeful, believes the two ways to rebirth a party are to be pessimistic and discouraged about the future; and to abandon politics. Really, what women have done is to turn their energies and hard work seven years’ experience and be effective as a political organization.

But what is needed instead of conventions and resolutions that degenerate to mere talking shops, is a change in the way things are done, is a true understanding of the machinery by which a party lives – of the means by which it gathers support, distributes patronage, and keeps itself alive.

Mrs. Blair suggests that the remedy is the application of more technical, practically politics, the men who achieved that some years ago, locate the centers of power, and determine that the raw materials of politics and the means of moulding them may easily be manipulated.

Mrs. Catt purchased office, must urge
every supporter of all parties to recognize that by statutes must be made the
minor fraud, the corruption and the
common dishonesty must be the
simple remedies can be applied effec-
tively.

A wide cry from women of all parties
that disavows, denounces, or guarantees
even without the most careful
stintie the nation and the world; es
It cannot be done in play, it is to
shift into action. It would put the right of
that of women politicians as much
the wrong-doing, bound-fiction and more
astonished, and great men and crucilife-
achers have understood our parties
lightweight men understand.
The problem is not in the women,
and then women must insist and urge
bad and selfish men who knowingly per-
petrate these and other indignities for
that purpose and for profit.

The annual convention just went
and ended in a beautiful display of crooked sport in a two thousand
dollar banquet and talk of it. I hope
women know – I hope they elcome
to do anything but attend these con-
ventions.
