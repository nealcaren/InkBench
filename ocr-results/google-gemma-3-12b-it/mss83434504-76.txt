BOXES.—Suppose you understand poultry!
JOHNS ON.—I suppose you understand poultry!
BOXES.—Yes!
JOHNS ON.—Then perhaps you can answer this. We’ll 
suppose a hen lays a dozen eggs, along comes another hen, and

JOHNS ON.—It doesn’t matter; supposing a hen lays a dozen 
eggs, and another hen hatches them, just a common ebery-day 
hen, I suppose.
JOHNS ON.—It doesn’t matter, supposing a hen lays a dozen 
eggs—and another hen hatches them, who is the mother?” a dozen 
hen and sits on dose eggs, an hatches at a dozen ducks; is de 
hen de mudder or dose ducks? Did you ever see a hen lay ducks.

BOXES.—What is it?
JOHNS ON.—I’ll tell you; what is it that hatches eggs?

going to lay?
