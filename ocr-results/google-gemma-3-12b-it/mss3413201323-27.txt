man power. What would we think that army can never be formidable, or
of a man in a time of crisis, with a great army of men? Colonel Roosevelt’s opinion is that there is no limit to the number of men that can be turned out to reinforce a line, and that what we need is something more than a paper army. He declares that the army has to be filled with men who know how to think and act, men who are capable of taking advantage of the situation in which they find themselves.  He holds that “a paper army” is of no account.

THE ARMY WORKERS AND TRAINING. 
An army that is not well trained is as formidable as a paper army. A training that teaches men to think and act will prove itself to be better than machines, because the men can adapt themselves to conditions that can not be foreseen. The training of the “Big Men” should be a part of our military system.

JOHNSON’S STATEMENT. 
The former Governor Smith has made a “flat” statement in the course of that he believes the “Big Men” should be trained and that “Big” Men trained are just as useful as regular soldiers. He does not think that to send untrained men to the front would be wise.

[A blurry image is here]

Washington, May 26 – A man interested in an amendment proposing woman suffrage,
a strong advocate
The legislative action of 1870 ordered all their rights then new partitions of holding education, property and right to make contracts.
The first woman suffragists were advocates of the protective wings afforded by the home, an institution as of old. The first advocates are recorded as those of 1832 and in 1847 some of the more insistent women. 
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert, with several others, in 1850 made of the establishment of an Associated Woman's Society. For the cause
They were followed shortly by a great number.  Though for some time their efforts were regarded as fanciful, Mr. John P. Irish a prominent politician, Mr. Joseph Glidden, an earnest man of high public standing, men with influence and the right to the people's
support, joined. Soon after, came many others, many men of prominence.

The number of ladies working for the consideration of the right of woman suffrage was very scant to begin with. 

It has had a better support. 

Mr. Irish, as is known, was a prominent man in Congress, as a man of courage.
