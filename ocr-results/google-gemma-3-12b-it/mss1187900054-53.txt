**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it is not remarkable for any striking announcement or brilliant suggestion, it is a thorough and well-considered review of the condition of the country and the duties of the government.

**FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC REVIEW.**

The President begins with a review of the financial and economic condition of the country. He expresses satisfaction with the progress made in restoring the credit of the government and in reducing the public debt. He points to the increase in the volume of trade and the improvement in the condition of agriculture as evidence of the prosperity of the nation. He recommends that the government continue its policy of economy and retrenchment, and that it avoid any unnecessary increase in the public debt.

**THE CURRENCY QUESTION.**

The currency question is given a prominent place in the message. The President expresses the opinion that the present currency system is not satisfactory, and that it should be revised. He recommends that Congress take steps to provide for the free coinage of silver, but he insists that any change in the currency system should be made in such a way as to maintain the stability of the dollar and the credit of the government.

**THE CIVIL SERVICE.**

The President reiterates his support for the civil service reform movement. He recommends that Congress pass a law providing for the examination and selection of government employees on the basis of merit. He believes that the civil service should be free from political influence and that it should be conducted in a businesslike and efficient manner.

**THE INDIANS.**

The President discusses the Indian question at length. He expresses the opinion that the policy of the government toward the Indians should be one of assimilation and civilization. He recommends that Congress provide for the education of Indian children and that it encourage the Indians to adopt the habits and customs of civilized life.

**THE NAVY.**

The President recommends that Congress provide for the construction of a new navy. He believes that the United States should have a navy that is equal to the protection of its commerce and the defense of its interests.

**FOREIGN RELATIONS.**

The President touches upon several foreign relations. He expresses his desire for the maintenance of peace and amity with all nations. He recommends that Congress ratify the treaty with China, which provides for the exclusion of Chinese laborers from the United States.

**CONCLUSION.**

The President concludes his message with an appeal to Congress to act in a spirit of patriotism and to unite in the promotion of the welfare of the country. He expresses his confidence that the American people will continue to prosper and that the United States will remain a beacon of hope and freedom to the world.
