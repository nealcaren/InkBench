Dear Mrs. Douglas,

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you, I am well sure you are
looked after now, and hope of pro-
boking a reply. We really are
very unwell in the dark about
you, & do not even think whether
you write could office under the
Government, as we have not been
by the contrary & conclude that - you
do - & therefore that you would not
over the novelty that would
be of old. I hope that your health
is good - that you can represent
well yourself, & you family.
