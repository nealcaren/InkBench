era may have deserved, but no one knows what the members of the organizations meant to do. All I was that the leaders of the two societies so believed. Look at page 240, near the bottom, and you will find that this was so.

In describing the division, I followed the lines of the statement published by my father in the Woman's Journal off of 11, 1879. That account was written by me. My father preferred to put his name to it because he thought it would bring down considerable odium upon us from not upon me. To his surprise, the odium failed to materialize. I don’t suppose the Nationals approved of it, but they seemed to recognize that it was a moderate and not an ill-natured statement of old case.

You seem to think it a pity that the subject has been reopened; and you say you think nit "I have given the Nationals 'some unjust vindication.'" I have tried to be fair, and to err, if at all, on the side of mildness.
You must remember that a whole series of unjust attacks have been given to the American side, and there has been no mince, except that in one article in the ‘Journal’s’, 31 years ago. Since then, the publishers have not airned to be fair.

And in many hands it is easier to cook up more reflections than to catch the truth by means of a sieve.

The original exhibition was on 29 Aygust, 1879, upheld by the Nationals as the only show of nations in the country. The late rumor was that *they* wanted to depress the profits of the later one on the 17th of September. Because of this happening, they undertook a hired man to undermine and slander the later case. Their efforts were not successful.

organized mainly to boost the Republican party; that my mother’s order “Miss Anthony” wanted to do and other things equally absurd. (These quota-
tions are not verbatim; I have not the book here, but that is the substance of them.)

After all this, when I wrote my mother's life, could it be reason-
ably expected that I should not state her side of the case, in a matter where her motives had been so much misrepresented?

It is proverbial that when a lie once gets started, the truth can
seldom catch up with it. This is even more true when the lie has got
more than 40 years start, and has already gone all over the world. I
am not sanguine enough to suppose that my belated book can counteract
the version which has so long been current; but it seemed to me that
the facts should be stated, if only in the interest of correct history.
But I am truly sorry to have worried you so much. I lay awake all night, the night after your letter came.

I think your review does my book both more and less than justice.
It is not a “great book.” It is not nearly as animating and leaning.

Here. Dorr has made her book. On the other hand, I do not think I have
(I believe it is Lilith’s wrathful fire) as much courage as she has.
Do not send me her book. I am trying to get it, but have not yet succeeded.

I am not sure that I should have written a life of my mother, if I had
known the amount of undeserved criticism it would meet at the hands of
the ladies of the press. Especially of the mass-producing branch. This is
a matter that hurts deeply; for I am convinced that not one of these critics
has ever read my book with any degree of care.
