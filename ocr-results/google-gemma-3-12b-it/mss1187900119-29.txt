circumstances are at present against him. But he is
young and poor in pocket and no doubt unable to
discharge his duty in respect of the unavoidable expense
of the sickness and death of his noble and devoted wife -
the purest, sweet in his life - gentle and noble.

Let me pray you then, not to judge him yet. Wait,
suspend final conclusion as to him for I cannot
help but believe that in all the course of his
life and marriage of the dear dead girl who loved him
so devotedly he meant well and true. His errors,
I think have been those of judgment only.
You must pardon me for speaking at all on the sub-
ject, for it is one reared to your own heart and home, but
I know that you were fond of him; and would now, even
if no one knew it, be pleased if he proved worthy of a place
in your family circle. Harriet said so much to you because
I love you and I always liked Morris, I am done and shall
now open my life again upon the subject to any living soul,
both worthless and their little ones.

Affectionately yours,
Grett Hart
