My dear Douglass:

On my passage from
New York yesterday from Phila. &
spoken on Friday evening, I called at Hun-
kool’s office for news about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is that the clerks
said the office around me.

The steamer is the “Orange Nassau.”
She will sail from Pierpont Jones (along
side of the Yale street ferry,) Brooklyn,
on Friday next, 4th instant at noon, for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on this
information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the
“Orange Nassau” is the poorest steamer of the
line. And she is steamy and so-so and
guess we can stand it for six days on board ½
