Mrs. Frederick Douglass,
Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D. C.

August 31st. The ones marked #1 & #2, you can have your choice of
as agreed upon in our contract. The letters are to be round raised
letters, and the rosettes are to be the bronze work that you selected
in our office. We enclose a regular form of contract, and if you
decide that either design #1 or #2 is satisfactory to you, you can sign
on the bottom line of both contracts, and return them to me, and I will
sign them and return one to you.

We also send a design marked #3, with two very handsome leaves
made in bronze, and applied to the granite in the same way as we do
the rosettes. If this should suit you better than the other tablets,
You can sign the contracts with the clause for #3 design, and return
them all to us, and we will sign them and return one to you.

We appreciate very much the placing of this order in our hands,
and we shall take pride in executing it in the very finest way, and
making it entirely satisfactory to you.

Hoping to hear from you soon,
Yours respectfully,
J. Weston
