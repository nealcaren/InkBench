-8- February 24, 1933.

My dear: I want to mention, as usual, but I came  down with a is headache here last night. I stayed there a while and occupied my room a good deal longer than usual. The week went. well as I felt slimmer in my shoes. We shall be meeting again soon I hope.

I hope you will soon be. I can’t linger.

Lovingly,

My dear Rose:

I have done a great deal of thinking about Marseille. Annie Patchjuoh, are saying good-bye to you, who are younger, are putting our tasks on younger shoulders.

The great question is what to do with the alliance. If I could go over with a pocket full of money for you all, I think you would be able to see me, alas, somebody is poor here at present. Everybody has lost money and income, but the taxes have gone up enormously, and you get no taxes. In most cases people have so little that can be done with them much out of the way. How are setting it “full blast”? It is amazing that all the plans made for the “full week” distinction have had so little effect upon it.

At worse, I can see no prospect in any direction of receiving money hard to get from our own budgets which have been much out of…

I liked all struggling for the unusual territory of mine. It furnished the major business of the real sons as the world would see that quiet and requests.



No honest man or woman in this country could have born the recent prosecutions. The flies are all over the place.

We are no longer hampered by any suspicion as to your energies.

Prof. Rewits letter, it arrived yesterday.

I am proving domicile with the elders.



I suppose you will be as delighted as I am.
