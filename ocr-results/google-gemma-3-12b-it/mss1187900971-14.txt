Sharp Building, K.C. Mo.

Dear Mr. Anderson:—

It will seem before five years since we started renting the
premises at 2326 Brooklyn. We have tried very hard to protect everything about
the place and taking everything into consideration, I feel that we have done
pretty well. Certain it is our ambition to keep the place as nice appearing as
is possible with an old house as far along this line as we
can without some aid. There’ll have to be some papering done. The dining-
room, the southwest bedroom, second floor and the entire third floor needs pa-
pering badly. Then the furnace needs definite repairs. The door will not close
and to shake the grate is impossible. The discomfort of living in our type
winter where the furnace will not heat is past understanding except someone
experiences it. The third floor is uninhabitable summer and winter. In summer
it is so hot we are obliged to allow the girls sleep on the floors of the low-
er rooms, which make very bad for discipline, and in the winter they are crowd-
ed into the three rooms on the third floor because the third floor is too cold.

This, Mr. Anderson, can be remedied by insulating the roof of this
house and the North and West windows. We are having such a struggle to secure
coal winters and what we get does us little good because the heat is dissipated
before it reaches the various rooms.

Then too, Mr. Anderson, the house needs exterior painting—it looks
very bad, I feel that the rent we are paying entitles us to secure the requests
we make herein—they are not unreasonable but absolutely necessary to our type
