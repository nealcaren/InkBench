**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE ON THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.**

The President’s message to Congress on the Pacific Railroad question is a document of considerable length and importance. It reviews the history of the construction of the road, the difficulties encountered, and the various measures that have been taken to secure its maintenance and improvement. The President expresses the opinion that the road is of vital importance to the commercial and military interests of the country, and that it should be maintained in a condition of efficiency. He recommends that Congress take steps to provide for the payment of the outstanding bonds of the road, and that it authorize the construction of branch lines to connect with the main line.

The message also discusses the question of the consolidation of the various railroad lines that have been built in the Pacific States. The President believes that such consolidation would be beneficial to the interests of the country, and he recommends that Congress authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to investigate the matter and make recommendations.

The message is a comprehensive and well-reasoned statement of the President’s views on the Pacific Railroad question. It is likely to have a considerable influence on the debate in Congress.
