toward the close of the war. The few days we lay in camp there witnessed the stirring and eventful scenes around Petersburg which culminated in Lee's surrender at Appomattox, and saw General Joseph B. Johnson’s army retreating through North Carolina, followed by Sherman's about the time we went into camp at Faison the battle of Bentonville was fought, probably not more than twenty-five miles from us.

While we lay in camp at Faison Station an incident occurred which in its result was quite important to me; and it was so unique in its character that I deem it worth relating briefly. Had the result been different I might not quite tell the story.

Although no enemy was near we kept a good picket line, for we did not know when he might appear. The Confederates had a habit of coming at unexpected times, and experience had taught us the necessity of constant vigilance. We were short of lieutenants, and I found myself detailed one morning to do a lieutenant's place on the picket line. At the same time that the Adjutant had been detailed as brigade officer of the day. I don't know that he had been detailed as brigade straight in the transaction, but I felt at the time all was right and imposed upon. Officers in the army lay much stress on rank, and when I saw myself detailed to do a lieutenant’s duty on the picket line, and the captain of another company going out as brigade officer of the day, I thought I was not receiving fair treatment, and so in-formed the adjutant, using pretty strong language. But my hot words didn’t change matters any, and we went out just as we were detailed.

I was in charge of the men from our regiment, and fortune so arranged matters that we were placed directly opposite the headquarters of General Terry, then commanding our corps, and not more than thirty or forty rods from his tent. Soon after we went into duty Captain Riley, brigade officer of the day, came along the line, and in addition to giving me some general directions, instructed me specially that no person be allowed to pass any portion of the picket line held by his men unless on a pass given or countersigned by him. The order seemed unusual to me, and I asked him if he was sure he meant for me to abide by it, as he said if we had not mistaken, and the order as given to me was exactly what he had received it from the division commander. He assured me his instructions and the order was exactly as he had received it, and I knew I must obey.

Shortly afterwards a man approached our line, claiming to be a messenger from General Terry, and said he had an important message for General Anderson, who was near us. He produced a pass, but as I had been instructed to allow no one to pass unless he had a pass signed by General Terry, I refused to let him go through. The man insisted that he had a pass from General Terry, and I told him I would not let him pass, but I would take him to Captain Riley.

I took the man to Captain Riley, who read the pass, and then said to me, "I gave that pass to that man yesterday, and he has been riding through the lines ever since.” I said, “Well, why didn’t you stop him?” He said, "I thought he was an important man, and I didn’t want to interfere with him.”
