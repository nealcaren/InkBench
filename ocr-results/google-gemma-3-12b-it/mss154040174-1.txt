**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It is a review of the condition of the country, with recommendations for legislation on various subjects. The most important of these recommendations are those relating to the currency question, the civil service, and the relations with Mexico.

**THE CURRENCY QUESTION.**

The President reiterates his belief that the existing currency system is inadequate to the wants of the country, and that some change is necessary. He suggests that the Government should resume the coinage of silver dollars, and that these dollars should be declared legal tender for all debts, public and private. He also recommends that the Government should purchase silver bullion and convert it into coin. The President believes that these measures would increase the volume of currency, stimulate trade, and relieve the financial distress which is felt in many parts of the country.

**THE CIVIL SERVICE.**

The President urges Congress to pass a law providing for the reform of the civil service. He believes that the present system of appointments is corrupt and inefficient, and that it is a source of much political strife. He recommends that all appointments to the civil service should be made on the basis of merit, as determined by competitive examinations. He also recommends that the number of offices filled by political patronage should be reduced to the minimum.

**RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.**

The President expresses his regret at the continued disturbances in Mexico, and he recommends that Congress should authorize the President to take such measures as may be necessary to protect American citizens and property in that country. He also recommends that Congress should appropriate funds to assist in the relief of the Mexican people who are suffering from the effects of the recent war.

**OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS.**

The President also recommends that Congress should pass laws to protect the forests of the country, to regulate the fisheries, and to improve the navigation of the rivers. He also recommends that Congress should provide for the education of the Indians, and that it should grant pensions to deserving soldiers and sailors.

**A THOROUGH REVIEW.**

The President’s message is a thorough review of the condition of the country, and it is filled with sound and practical recommendations. It is a document that deserves the careful consideration of Congress.

**LOCAL NEWS.**

**POLICE COURT.**

Yesterday’s police court proceedings were not of a particularly interesting nature. Several cases of petty larceny were disposed of, and a few drunken rowdies were sent to the station house to sleep off their inebriety.

**THEATRE ROYAL.**

The Theatre Royal is attracting large audiences nightly. The performance of “The Mikado” last evening was a decided success.

**OBITUARY.**
