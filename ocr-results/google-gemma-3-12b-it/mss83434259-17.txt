Thus has passed away a beloved Christian brother, a heroic patriot, a worthy and valuable man. Our loss is his eternal gain. His life, words, deeds, convictions, sacrifices and sufferings, are the best eulogy that can be given. To these mourning friends—a widowed wife, bereaved parents, sorrowing brothers and sisters—we tender our heartiest sympathy. Your grief is both relieved and intensified by the worth of him who is gone. When in the sweetest converse and enjoyment with earthly friends, the thought will intrude that the heart may be stung with the agony of separation. Seek not at once to check the will of Him who doeth all things well. Your sorrow is the measure of your love. It is sacred to the memory of the loved and lost. You who mourn a kind and tender husband, are exercised with a sadness too deep, too precious, too sacred to be the object of public gaze. As the years of your life shall roll around, and you reflect upon the melancholy occurrence of the fact that the burial of your beloved husband signified on the birthday, may you be enabled to understand more and more the profound mystery and meaning of life. May a vital union with Him who can fill the void He himself in wisdom transferred to the celestial city. The stricken parents may seek to have their wounded hearts healed by reflecting upon the goodness which gave them such an offering to place upon the altar of God and humanity. And we hope, in a restored, elevated and redeemed country, they may ever experience a reward for their opulent gift for its perpetuity and life. These brothers and sisters will not fail to remember the heroic soldier and Christian, who, in the morning of his manhood, was transferred to the celestial city. Cherish his honored and beloved memory.

“The idea of thy life shall sweetly creep
Into my study of imagination;
And every lovely organ of thy life
Shall come apparelled in more precious habit,
More moving, delicate, and full of life
Into the eye and prospect of my soul,
Than when thou livedst indeed.”

And this, preach to us all! Do this occasion, and this Providence, and the work begun, and progressing so grandly, be checked and ever
