A CALL TO ACTION
by Carrie Chapman Catt.
Inframanth Speech at a Mass Meeting in Memorial Hall, Cleveland, April 17, 1921

Schedules are for politicians.

There is not an audience in any nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the hearts of the people.
There is no international peace that does not respond. There is no attitude toward war that is willing to say that he wants another war. There is nobody who does not want peace, but how are we to get it? That is the practical question, and in our own states and cities, before we can act collectively, think our way through.

We don’t settle that question when we have a million different points of view, but wait for somebody to act.
Everybody at this time is extremely careful being non-partisan. I don't care a rap about being non-partisan.

I was for a Democratic League of Nations. I am for a Republican party or any other kind. I believe in taking action on questions of this kind and not waiting too long. It does not matter what party is in or who is President. Our country is not judged by its parties. It is judged as a nation.

Today there isn’t anybody in any nation who knows what we are going to do; nobody in any other nation and nobody in this nation knows what we are going to do. But I ask you if there is anybody campaigning to move, moment with an earnest crusading spirit who is as proud and indifferent apparently, and as inactive. Though there was not before us the greatest question which was ever presented to the nations of the world.

It is a curious kind of psychology that is upon our nation. We have always been a nation in favor of arbitration. It was this country, I believe, that signed the first treaty of that character. We are a people settling questions in our own way. Then, we approach the people, one at a time in this question.
