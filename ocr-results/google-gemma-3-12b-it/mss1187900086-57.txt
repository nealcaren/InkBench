My dear Bennett,
July 13. 1889.

Soon after you previous excellent
letter, and before I could see him about the
Crawfordly & St. Thomas Co. Blaine, went
out on warning departed from Washington
for Ban Harbor, where he now is, and so-
day the papers. He evidently found his climate
of Washington at this season, combined with
his previous of his over exposure to sunshine,
in any case inspired with him, I was en-
vinced that time, toil, and activity, had made
inroads upon his health and constitution.
And that he must either take rest, or other means
knowing that a personal interview with him
would be for better for me than writing him,
I have not decided the St Thomas proposal
to him as yet. The President, too, as
is now known, interviewed him.

St. is understood here that no Constant
appointments will now be made in the
absence of Secretery Blaine, hence no progress
