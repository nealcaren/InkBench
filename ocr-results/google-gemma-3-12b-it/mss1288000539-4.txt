My dear Mr. Blackwell

Thank you very much indeed for your
most kind permission to me to set some of the verses
of your translation of "La Palmera" to music. 
I found the translation so appealing + beautiful
that music to it would float into my head, + last
I was tempted to make a very simple little song out
of three or four of the verses, just for our private use. 
Then as our friends seemed to like it, my sister-in-law
offered to write to you, in case it might be published.
I should most certainly give myself the great pleasure
