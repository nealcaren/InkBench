colony of Virginia, on business demanding speedy attention. He had heard of the young man’s fame, and was anxious to have him as his guest. Washington declined to stop, but Mr. Chamberlain in insisted, promising as an inducement, to introduce him to the most beautiful young widow in Virginia. Washington finally consented to stop for dinner, with the understanding that he would resume his journey immediately thereafter. This was agreed to, and he directed his servant to have his horse ready at the gate as soon as dinner was over.

In the parlor he was introduced to the ladies, including “the beautiful young widow.” Her maiden name was Martha Dandridge. She had been married to Col. John Parke Custis at the early age of seventeen, and now, at twenty-five, was a widow with two children. She is described as being at that time “short, plump, with dark eyes, beautiful as the hues of the rainbow, and her hair dark and handsome. Her form charming, fresh, and fragrant as the rose, and gentle as the summer breeze.”

Washington was at once captivated and thrilled by her rare beauty and loveliness. The passion of love at once awoke in his bosom, and she promptly responded to it with a modest blush. “‘Twas a case of love at first sight.’ He remained for dinner, also for supper, and tarried all night. Even in the morning he was in no hurry to go, and the sun was high in the heavens before he was again on his way to Williamsburg. He remained some time at the capital, and frequently visited the fair widow. They were married at the White House, in 1758, a little over a year-and-a-half afterward.

From the White House to Yorktown I went by steamer, enjoying a delightfully ride down the York River. But as I went my mind would ever and anon contrast this ride with the last one I had taken, over this same river. Then I was in the midst of grim visaged soldiers, thinking possibly on a mission of death. Now I was in the midst of a thousand happy men smiling and some, on pleasure bent.

About that time there was a large population in Virginia, far less people was there then than now, but a good many, too, as it is said, "there was people enough to sow.” But if you would get a good and reliable history of Virginia, you must go into the old records, and there learn the names of those who were in great measure the founders of the Commonwealth.

It was at Rose Hill plantation, in Prince William county, that I was most agreeably surprised. The mansion is a fine one and the place is filled with old associations. It was near this place that Sylvia Pope, daughter of Col. William Pope, was born May 31st, 1750.
