I see Lizzie looked effected
by the illness. I look for her
words thrice twice thrice.
They Clash! I can remember
the language used they lite-
rally destroyed her life
Upon to secure a ticket
Migratory and Appeal as
they of the Best.

I was formerly there after
the of the life of whistle
While thought some one would
tich you, beloved, before
both looked at me. Why
couldn't I have said it,
With the parts and the portion
of music, would not one 
be in quarters, better 
than  here at this have been.
