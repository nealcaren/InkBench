**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it does not present any startling or sensational recommendations, it is full of matter that will require careful consideration by the legislative branch of the government.

**The Tariff Question.**

The tariff question is, as usual, the most prominent feature of the message. The President expresses the opinion that the existing tariff laws are not satisfactory, and that a revision is necessary. He does not, however, enter into a detailed discussion of the subject, but simply states that he is of the opinion that the tariff should be so adjusted as to promote the interests of American industry and to secure the revenue necessary for the support of the government.

**The Currency Question.**

The President also touches upon the currency question, and expresses the opinion that the time has come for a more thorough discussion of this important subject. He suggests that a commission be appointed to investigate the matter and to report to Congress as to the best means of securing a stable and reliable currency.

**Civil Service Reform.**

The President reiterates his support for civil service reform, and urges Congress to pass legislation that will provide for the appointment of government officials on the basis of merit. He expresses the opinion that such legislation is necessary to secure the efficiency and integrity of the public service.

**Foreign Affairs.**

The President’s message also deals with foreign affairs. He expresses his satisfaction with the relations between the United States and other nations, and urges Congress to continue to pursue a policy of peace and amity. He also recommends that Congress take steps to protect the interests of American citizens abroad.

**Indian Affairs.**

The President discusses the Indian question at some length, and expresses his belief that the policy of assimilation is the best way to deal with the Indian problem. He recommends that Congress provide for the education of Indian children and for the allotment of land to Indian families.

**Other Matters.**

The message also touches upon a number of other matters, including the improvement of the rivers and harbors, the construction of a trans-isthmian canal, and the protection of the public lands.

**A Conservative Document.**

In general, the President’s message is a conservative document. It does not propose any radical changes in the existing order of things, but simply suggests that Congress take steps to improve the administration of the government and to promote the welfare of the country.

**The President’s Reception.**

The President was greeted with enthusiastic applause when he entered the House yesterday to deliver his message. The galleries were crowded with spectators, and the members of Congress were eager to hear what the President had to say.

**The Opposition.**

The opposition party has already begun to criticize the President’s message. They claim that it is vague and unsatisfactory, and that it fails to address the pressing issues of the day.

**A Time for Reflection.**

The President’s message is a call to action. It is a call to Congress to consider carefully the issues before them and to take steps to promote the welfare of the country. It is a time for reflection and for action.
