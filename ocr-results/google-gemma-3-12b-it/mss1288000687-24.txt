**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it does not contain any startling or sensational announcements, it is full of important recommendations and observations.

**The Tariff Question.**

The tariff question is, as might have been expected, the most prominent feature of the message. The President expresses the opinion that the existing tariff laws are not satisfactory, and that a revision is necessary. He does not, however, enter into a detailed discussion of the subject, but simply states that he is prepared to recommend such changes as will, in his judgment, promote the interests of the country.

**The Currency Question.**

The currency question is also touched upon, but in a more general way. The President expresses the opinion that the existing currency system is adequate to the needs of the country, but he suggests that some modifications may be desirable in the future. He recommends that Congress take steps to provide for the redemption of government bonds in gold.

**Civil Service Reform.**

The President reiterates his support for civil service reform, and urges Congress to pass a law providing for the examination and appointment of government officials on a merit basis. He expresses the belief that such a law would improve the efficiency of the government and reduce the opportunities for corruption.

**Foreign Affairs.**

The President’s message touches briefly upon foreign affairs. He expresses his satisfaction with the relations between the United States and other countries, and he recommends that Congress continue to maintain a policy of peace and amity.

**Other Matters.**

The message also deals with a number of other matters, including the Indian question, the public lands, and the improvement of the rivers and harbors. The President recommends that Congress take steps to protect the Indians, to dispose of the public lands in a manner that will promote settlement and development, and to improve the navigation of the rivers and harbors.

**A Conservative Document.**

The President’s message is, on the whole, a conservative document. It does not contain any radical proposals, and it is likely to be well received by both parties in Congress. It is a message that reflects the President’s desire to maintain the status quo and to avoid any unnecessary controversy.

**LOCAL NEWS.**

**The Weather.**
