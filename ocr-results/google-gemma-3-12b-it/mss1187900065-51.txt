**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it does not present any startling or sensational recommendations, it is full of important information and thoughtful suggestions.

**The Financial Question.**

The financial condition of the country is, according to the President, sound and satisfactory. He expresses the opinion that the policy of resumption of specie payments has been successful, and that the currency is now stable and reliable. He recommends that no change be made in the existing financial system, and that the government continue to maintain a sound and conservative policy.

**The Tariff.**

The President devotes a considerable portion of his message to the discussion of the tariff question. He expresses the opinion that the existing tariff laws are in need of revision, and that a more equitable and just system should be adopted. He does not, however, offer any specific recommendations as to what changes should be made. He simply states that the subject should be carefully considered by Congress, and that a policy should be adopted which will promote the interests of all sections of the country.

**The Civil Service.**

The President reiterates his support for the civil service reform movement, and recommends that Congress pass laws which will further strengthen the civil service system. He believes that the civil service should be based on merit, and that appointments to government positions should be made on the basis of qualifications and fitness, rather than on political considerations.

**The Indian Question.**

The President expresses his concern over the condition of the Indian tribes, and recommends that Congress take steps to protect their rights and interests. He believes that the policy of assimilation is the best way to deal with the Indian problem, and that the Indians should be encouraged to adopt the habits and customs of civilized life.

**The Navy.**

The President recommends that Congress provide for the construction of additional warships, and that the navy be strengthened and improved. He believes that the United States should maintain a strong navy, in order to protect its commerce and interests abroad.

**Other Matters.**

The President also touches upon a number of other subjects, including the question of education, the improvement of the rivers and harbors, and the protection of the public lands. He recommends that Congress take action on these matters, and that the government continue to promote the welfare of the people.

**A Conservative Document.**

In general, the President’s message is a conservative document. It does not propose any radical changes in the existing policies of the government, but it does offer a number of thoughtful suggestions for the improvement of the country. It is a message which should be carefully considered by Congress, and which should be helpful in guiding the legislation of the present session.
