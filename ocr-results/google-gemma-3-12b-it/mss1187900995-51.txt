**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE ON THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.**

The President’s message to Congress on the Pacific Railroad question is a document of considerable length and importance. It reviews the history of the construction of the road, the difficulties encountered, and the various measures that have been taken to secure its maintenance and improvement. The President expresses the opinion that the road is of vital importance to the commercial and military interests of the country, and that it should be maintained in a condition of efficiency. He recommends that Congress make an appropriation to enable the railroad companies to make necessary repairs and improvements, and that a commission be appointed to investigate the condition of the road and to make recommendations for its future management.

The President also discusses the question of the extension of the Pacific Railroad to the Pacific coast. He states that the construction of this extension is of great importance to the development of the resources of the West, and that it should be undertaken as soon as possible. He recommends that Congress authorize the construction of the extension, and that an appropriation be made to enable the railroad companies to complete the work.

The message is a comprehensive and well-reasoned statement of the Pacific Railroad question, and it is likely to have a considerable influence on the action of Congress.
