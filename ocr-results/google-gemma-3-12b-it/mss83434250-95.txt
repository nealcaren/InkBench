82 CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.

sedes the civil power ; and on this account I should have been obliged to vote, as I have said, against one of the resolutions of my excellent friend from Ohio, (Mr. Giddings,) or should at least have required that it be amended in conformity with the constitution of the United States.”

CONCLUSION.

It has thus been proved, that by the law and usage of modern civilized nations, confirmed by the judgment of eminent statesmen, and by the former practice of this government, that the President, as commander-in-chief, has the authority, as an act of war, to liberate the slaves of the United States have in former times sanctioned the liberation of slaves even of loyal citizens, by military commanders, in time of war, without compensation therefor ; and I have deemed slaves captured in war from belligerent subjects as entitled to their freedom.

* GENERAL WAR POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.  It is not intended in this chapter to explain the general war powers of the President. There are princi-pally contained in the Constitution, Art. II. Sect. 1, Cl. 1 and 7 ; Sect. 2, Cl. 1; Sect. 3, Cl. 1, and in Sect. 1, Cl. 1, and necessary implication in Art. I. Sect. 9, Cl. 2. By Art. II. Sect. 2, the President is made commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States when called into the service of the United States. This clause gives ample powers of the war to the President; when the army and navy are lawfully in actual service. His military authority is supreme, under the constitution, while governing and regulating the land and naval forces, and treating captures on land and water in accordance with such rules as Congress may have passed in pursuance of Art. 1, Sect. 8, Cl. 11, 14. Congress, or to effect troops, and by impeachment of the President; but for the general movement of the war, - the President is responsible to no other department of the government. His duty is to uphold the constitution and enforce the laws, and to respect whatever rights loyal citizens are entitled to enjoy in time of civil war, to the fullest extent that may be consistent with the performance of mod- ifying duty imposed on him. “The effect of a state of warring or modifying war is that the president is absolutely the commander-in-chief."

What is the extent of the military power of the President under this clause? Does it extend to any ordinary power of carrying on war ? 

The plain answer to that is, no, it does not. As far as the government is really a government at war, the president is commander-in-chief.
