Dear Miss Blackwell,—

We will be very glad indeed to have you on the committee even though you can take no active part. Enough Jimmie Higgenses turned up to do the work, & no reasonable person could expect you to do the detailed work as we can get speakers & place together, as that seems to be the time honored method of raising money.

The National Committee informs me that broadcasting station with license can be brought for $50,000. But they want to raise more, & partly to have an endowment to cover operating expenses in case the commercial users should attempt to boycott us.

Fraternally,
Alfred Baker Lewis
Secy.
