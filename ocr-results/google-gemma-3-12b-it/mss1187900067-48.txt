feel what I am growing old,
and not now what at I have
been - although time these 
me - your will see by
this letter that it hardens
for me to write now then
in old times when my
needs were weak & steady
and strong - Give my
kind regards to your 
wife in which my good faith
heartily joins.  Enter this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend and wellwisher
James C. R. Buffive

Ruth says, come and see
us - I day knows. You have
now an engagement not
fulfilled. J.B. 13
