communion singers. Only when several of these parents had expressed their desire for help in meeting the spiritual needs of their children was the first step toward establish- onment of a Sunday School taken.

On December 12, 1936, four mothers met with Mr. Thurman and Mrs. Beeckels, the study group chairman, to determine the general direction in which to go, and to the first step to be taken. They were determined that their children to have opportunity to discover a sound spiritual basis for everyday living; that whatever they were taught should be so basic that nothing need be undertaken later, but that all who would contribute to building dependable foundations for lifelong growth. The few Books for study, comment and exchange. 

Dr. Frank had suggested Miss Ruth Adamson, a student at San Francisco State College, as a probability for the teacher the School. Miss Adamson was invited to visit the school and to confer with Miss Thurman and others. After visit and in interviews with Miss Thurman she agreed to undertake the responsibilities of organizing the rooms and decided that the children should assemble in the Sunday school room at the rear of the church, known as the "Parish House". 

On December 26, 1936, the first Sunday School session was held after Miss Adamson had spent days and nights in Decoration of the room and preparation of material to be used. Forty children were present, and with out a single exception to our calling roll, each one enrolled in as class and others were placed upon a waiting list to be summoned when more space and teachers could be provided. 

It was a joy to see them demonstrate the eagerness with which they entered into the school with enthusiasm that even the reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle remarked upon.

The old Alaska Building, in which the Fellowship Church had been located, was being torn down and the congregation advised to remove all their belongings. Upon receiving this information groups of members were organized with Dr. Thurman leading, to move the salvaged belongings into a small apartment under the Methodist Church where services were continuing.

Among the salvaged materials were a remarkable collection of choral music, bound in the original covers, and filled with choral pieces of various writers. It was then thought that a choir might be organized, but there were no voices to organize and so the choir remained in storage for a time.

Later, Walter B. Williams, a former tenor in the old Geary Street Methodist Church choir, a graduate of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and a former supply organist at the Fellowship Church, expressed his desire to re-establish a music program. Moreover, he knew the leadership of Correy Barrow, Williams, who had been hired for the purpose of arranging music, to organize the Fellowship choir, in order to re-establish choir singing.

The Fellowship Church has a few distinct honor hours in event months, undergoing the Fellowship twilight series based on worship through the arts. They have given four hours of poetry and music with Dr. Thurman as reader. Williams chose for voice teacher and Eleanor Mason Bush, Rossi's recordings were made of this service were now available to members and friends across the country, and to any who desired to hear a presentation of the unique ideals on which the Fellowship Church was built.

Miss Adamson left for New York City, a graduate of San Francisco State College, to pursue her study in education. With her went a collection of original papers and material which will be useful to the students. With the departure of Miss Adamson the high school choir turned over its organization to Walter Williams while he was making arrangements assumed that when Bud Simpson completed his work in San Francisco, he would handle the arrangements. 

Bud made feel that we needed to get ourselves established in a homestead to do our work in a premiership way. Mr. C.L. Schmidt had lost his confidence of state of affairs. Mr. Schmidt had lost hinges in his zeal for continuing as president and helped the choir become established in the Methodist near the San Francisco building.



A FELLOWSHIP CHURCH MUSIC
