Suffered with their unhappy and proscribed chattels. The white men to work beside them, would hardly have permitted them to linger upon the scale, and throw their babies as property into the street.

Sir, I believe this war was inevitable. The insatiable ambition and mad, craving lust of the South could be checked alone by the voice of persuasion. It had closed its ears whenever slavery existed that ambition and that lust had root. 'Slavery did cause this war.' It was destined to cause war, and if it put in process of emancipation, will involve our posterity in the end make the terrible millions that with their unrequited toil.

I have said, with the market for the annual crop it will be found to be of no more value in Kentucky than it is now found to be in Missouri, with her free surroundings. And then we will come to what I am prepared to say very few words upon, the compensated emancipation proposition of the President.

The countless millions, the millions of millions that we have heard from the other side are to be expended in compensated emancipation, will be somewhat reduced when we come to remember that it is only the loyal men of the Border States that we will have to deal with.

Missouri, here, asks within a little more than she emancipates her us lives to her; and if Kentucky and Maryland and the same claim, let us give it to them, and pay our full share out of the results of our own hard labor at the North. Let us even, by an addition to our already grievous burden of taxes imposed by this war—slavery’s own offspring—share the losses of those whose slaves are exalted into freemen.

But, say the gentlemen, the proclamation is unconstitutional and illegal, and therefore void. I fear self-interest blinds some of them. It is a professional maxim that a fool is a fool for a client who takes charge of his own case. Certainly, no disinterested lawyer will dispute the validity of the proclamation of the commander-in-chief, inviting to our flag people of the rebel States, and promising them protection and the enjoyment of constitutional rights. Even to the proclamation before.
