**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it does not contain any startling or sensational announcements, it is full of important recommendations and observations.

**The Tariff Question.**

The tariff question is, as might have been expected, the most prominent feature of the message. The President expresses the opinion that the existing tariff laws are not satisfactory, and that a revision is necessary. He does not, however, enter into a detailed discussion of the subject, but simply states that he is prepared to recommend such changes as will, in his judgment, promote the interests of the country.

**The Currency Question.**

The currency question is also touched upon, but in a less detailed manner than the tariff. The President expresses the opinion that the existing currency system is adequate, but that it should be carefully watched and adjusted as circumstances may require. He recommends that Congress take steps to provide for the redemption of government bonds in gold.

**Foreign Affairs.**

The President’s message is also devoted to a discussion of foreign affairs. He expresses his satisfaction with the friendly relations existing between the United States and other nations, and he recommends that Congress continue to pursue a policy of peace and amity. He refers to the recent treaty with China, and expresses the hope that it will be ratified by the Senate.

**Civil Service Reform.**

The President reiterates his support for civil service reform, and he recommends that Congress pass a law providing for the examination and appointment of government officials on a merit basis. He expresses his belief that such a law would improve the efficiency of the government and reduce the opportunities for corruption.

**Other Matters.**

The message also touches upon a number of other matters, including the Indian question, the public lands, and the improvement of the rivers and harbors. The President recommends that Congress take steps to protect the Indians, to conserve the public lands, and to improve the navigation of the rivers and harbors.

**General Character of the Message.**

The President’s message is a document of a conservative and non-partisan character. It is free from any undue excitement or exaggeration, and it is full of sound and practical recommendations. It is a message that should be received with favor by all patriotic citizens.
