**DENEEN SOUND CAMPAIGN ATTACKS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION.**

*BY PARRE BROWN*
Staff Correspondent of the Tribune

Senator William B. Hull, Republican candidate for re-election, made a scathing attack on the county administration at a meeting of the Kenilworth Republican club last night. He charged the county government with extravagance and inefficiency.

“The county administration is simply a weed patch,” Hull declared. “It is overgrown with useless offices. It is over-burdened with expense. It has failed to keep pace with the growth of the city of Chicago.”

Hull was introduced by Miss Ruth McConnaughey, a young woman who is rapidly gaining popularity in local Republican circles. 

Miss McConnaughey, in a bright and forceful speech, spoke of the need for a businesslike administration of the county government. “The people of Cook county deserve a government which is efficient, economical, and responsive to the needs of the public,” she said.

She added that the Hull campaign would “cut through red tape” and expose the waste and inefficiency of the county administration.

RENO, Nev., Dec. 9 – Edward S. Morse, Chicago banker, has lost his plea for freedom in the divorce action brought against him by his wife, Mrs. Florence Morse.

Mrs. Morse, who arrived here yesterday from Chicago, was greeted by a score of reporters and photographers. She declared she would “fight to the bitter end” to secure a divorce and an adequate alimony settlement.

Morse, who is under $10,000 bond secured by "Harry" Kinnison, a local bondman, declined to make any statement.
