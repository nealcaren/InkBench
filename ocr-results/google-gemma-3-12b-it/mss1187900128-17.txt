I know not where to find pastime
for them, I appeal to thy judgment.
I have ever been friendly to the
Colonel, having visited many
years at Lyme. Hayham on the
Island of Hayti; when my husband
wood a commission commercial.
under the name of Wilson & Levette,
& Co, we were known to the President
of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee for the house of Wilson Levette
& Co. One Wilson was also consul
for the United States and the
recognition of Hayti was effected
through him. For with him this record
in the State Department. 
as so served as to write for as to
influence publicly opinion in the
favor of the Colonel; people.

Begging you to excuse me for
detaining you, I remain 

Very Respectfully
Francis L. Wilson
