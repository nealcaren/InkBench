Surrogate’s Court, New York County, December, 1915. [Vol. 92.]

Mr. Leslie’s heirs at law have no interest in the determination of Mrs. Leslie’s heirs at law.

The unwisdom of any other construction of this act than that here recorded is exemplified by this case. When the common law said that God only made an heir it was replete with human and divine wisdom. Such heirs are naturally tender to the memory of ancestors. Their cupidity is bounded by the law of decency and propriety. Nor for all the inheritances in the world would a freeman bind his mother or father, for in a servile state it is known, like many in the old land as “property lives common,” and therefore not stuck on it most of the time, much as a claim seems potent or now as disappears. To our minds the evidence turns supporting to support the conclusions in this instance of importing a material interest in such heirs.

It is a matter of slight moment, it seems, to the human experience and human instinct for blood relatives to stain their line. Any other construction of this act than that here accorded to it leads to contrary attractions and excites the worst passions of men. But I ought not to dispose of this matter without some reference to the merits of the respective contentions of the parties. It is claimed in substance on the part of Mr. Frank Leslie's heirs at law that his widow could have no heirs at law of her own, as the by the antebellum laws of this country prior to 1861 held in a servile status; all such persons, like many in the “property lives common,” and therefore not stuck on it most of the time, much as a claim seems potent or now as disappears. To our minds the evidence turns supporting to support the conclusions in this instance of importing a material interest in such heirs.

thereafter outraged by charges detracting from their superior status, or by what they regard as an unjust attempt to include them, being of the higher caste, within the ranks of the servile caste. In view of this well-known fact, if for no general reason, this general indignation is not to be ignored in courts of justice. To my mind the cause of the indignation in this instance furnishes only another argument against a construction which would tend to bring to law to one dying without heirs of servile status.

On the merits of the papers presented in this matter it would seem that the origin, life and memory of the heirs at law of the original ascribed to her by the papers before me. The members of the highly respectable Southern family by Mrs. Leslie as her blood written by her own hands, reputation in the papers submitted to me. I must say that Mr. Leslie's heirs at law assert of the contentions of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie's children as servile. These reasons are en- tirely disappointing of Mr. Leslie’s heirs.
