From the New York Tribune.

The able argument of William Whiting upon the War Powers of Congress is producing an influence in quarters where it was not supposed that logic and truth could supplant the government. The pamphlet is winning recognition as one of the positive instrumentalities for the suppression of the rebellion. 

Mr. Whiting is an eminent lawyer of Boston, who has won great distinction before the Supreme Court of the United States by his success in important causes under the law in relation to patents. He has now wrought all his legal acumen to bear upon the investigation of the subjects set forth in the title of his recent work; and the conclusions at which he arrives, by lines of argument in which it will be found difficult to discover a flaw, are confirmed in the fullest degree of the constitutionality of all the powers assumed by Congress and by the President in dealing with this Rebellion.

From the Washington National Republican.

We find upon our table a book containing one hundred and forty-three pages, entitled “The War Powers of the President, and Legislative Powers of Congress” by William Whiting. The book exhibits great research, and, it seems to us, is complete and unanswerable in its argument, and with these has built a structure in which Law under the Constitution is the chief corner-stone, and Liberty the grand material of the entire edifice.

It is our hope hereafter to make extracts from some of his more pungent portions, so they shall be applicable to events closely impending in the future. With the intention of strengthening our national authority, the government must, in the labors of men of Loyalty and Energy. He has reached the continent of most patriots of our day, thus accustomed, previously, to find comfort and means. We have been to little that these have at last become convertible terms. Mr. Whiting speaks of the pioneers in the movement. We honor a man who has thrown off the chains that have at all times been made our sacred Constitution a shield for men and slavery, the most wickedly disgusting of wrongs.

From the Journal, Roxbury, Mass.

Mr. Whiting has made each point, which he treats with the insight of a man who has other ideas of statesmanship than those involved in caucus or congressional encounters. He easily consulted authorities with which to justify the conclusions of his own judgment, and carefully collected facts which bear upon his argument, and with these has built a structure in which Law under the Constitution is the chief corner-stone, and Liberty the grand material of the entire edifice.

From Army and Navy, Boston.

A work of great utility which we are happy to notice, and which deserves, we are sure, a wide circulation. It is by William Whiting, Esq., and is entitled “The War Powers of the President, and Legislative Powers of Congress.” The pamphlet is written in Mr. Whiting’s well-known and able style, and presents the subject in a manner which must be solid and convincing to the candid reader.
