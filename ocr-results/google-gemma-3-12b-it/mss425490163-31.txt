Dear Mrs. Terrell:

Nor can I tell you how much we are genuinely
delighted I was to receive your beautiful letter.
Yes, I knew that G.B. was going to confer on a
richly merited honorary degree. I was thrilled
to see another such honor bestowed upon one
of our noble educators.  Mr. Dewey’s department
of education should be exceptionally improved
by the addition of our friend.  The record of
the career of Professor G. B. is one to pride
ourselves in.  He has written and said and
done much to uplift the lives of colored men and
women. I truly feel that he is one of the finest
men in America.

We appreciate your continued loyalty and
interest in the work of the United Negro College
Fund and I'm sure you'll be interested to know that
we were able to provide $500,000 for loans to
graduate students this past year.

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

May we ask you to take a moment or two to read the enclosed leaflet
which deals with one of our critical problems – inequality of
educational opportunity for 10 million of America's citizens.

It is much to say that the major college representatives in
United Negro Colleges Fund – ministers, doctors, lawyers, nurses,
teachers – from our 14 colleges and teachers’ colleges, represent
the best that our race has to offer.

We are doing this now because opportunity knocks but once now
and we must seize it. This is our moment; and we must – like
Nehemiah – “sound the trumpet.” We must summon every resource
to meet this challenge. 

The United States, with its great wealth and leadership, cannot
conscientiously fail to provide the tools and the opportunity for
all of its citizens to achieve their full potential. 

Thanking you for your interest and support, I remain

Sincerely yours,

[Signature]
