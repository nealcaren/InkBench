Dear Donglass: Here I am, away up in the
North West, on my first visit to my granddaughter, Adelaide, the wife of L. B. Scott, who
happens to be present in discharge
"of his official duties,” at “Sooyossoo Lake,” in the
“Kanagan Country,” as they Call it here. For
2 years and a half, until two months
ago, which extracted the Cataract from my
left eye, and then waiting for the senses and
Sensitiveness to light to subside two weeks ago
for Spectacles with a Special glass suited
to my Left eye, and now, with the aid of that
glass, I can see almost as well as ever. So much
for Science and for Science. Thanks to Providence, his
own discovery and skill for my holding on so long. Nature has
dealt kindly with you and me. We may yet become 1776
