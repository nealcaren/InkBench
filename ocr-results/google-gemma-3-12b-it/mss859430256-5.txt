“Rose Parks’ previous gifts, often overlooked by youth accustomed to the privileges they enjoy, is a blessing as well as a reminder. Because she helped to make my world better, I will make the commitment to peer pressure and do the deal with the opportunities made available through her action. It is my responsibility to ensure that I explore each of the doors that were unlocked through the actions of Ms. Rosa Parks and others like her.”

These lessons were ones I took to heart; I began to believe that I could make a change in my community and, my life, for the better.”
