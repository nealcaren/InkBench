pursue, and I trust I shall
have your approval as soon as
that of friend Bassett.
Mrs. Blaine has been sick in Now
York for two weeks, and she
does not seem to get well. There
is much interest manifested in
her condition.
I thank you for long and very
kind letter, and regret that I don't
feel well enough to pay to you
now all that I had it in mind
to pay when I began it. Put me
worked hard even when we are
very young men ambitious to run
a long race.
With any hint of regards,
Yours Truly, J.Mills Thorne
