LAW OFFICE OF
ROBERT G. INGERSOLL,
1421 NEW YORK AVENUE, WASHINGTON, D. C.,

Mr. 6
1883

"Dear Strong Cop,
I think the quotation
at the head of your article
is an appeal to mercy
to the worst to justice.
I think the following you
see same play in better:
"When my house when you
do take the path
That doth contain my horse; You
take my life,
When you do take the means
whereby I live,"
You will pardon
the suggestion, what do you
say?"
