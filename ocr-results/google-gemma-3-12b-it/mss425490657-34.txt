Dear Madam:

Before you decide to repaper and redécorate your home—why not let us show you how you may save money by cleaning the old surfaces, making them look new, for a fraction of the cost of new work?

Whether it be PAINT, WALL PAPER, CALICOFIN or WALL TREES—you’ll be surprised how quickly and satisfactorily all traces of soot and smoke, dirt, dust and grime can be removed by our special process.

We will gladly DEMONSTRATE our process without charge, in your own home—and furnish you with an estimate as to the cost of our work for your entire rooms.

In addition to our Interior Cleaning, we do INTERIOR DECORATING, EXTERIOR PAINTING, ABATEMENT OF FIRE, N.U. WALL COAT, and Window Washing. We also furnish and install A-1 LUSTRE WALL FINISH, which adds beauty, durability and fire protection to your walls.

Give us a call – we’ll do the rest.

We serve all sections of Washington, D.C., suburbs and Maryland.

“Will you be here next Wednesday?” the Countess inquired. “I shall see you and several interesting exercises which you would enjoy, I am sure. I shall go to the school Tuesday and spend the night there.  I wish you could go too. You would enjoy a visit to Warwick Castle, I know, everything in the United States is new, continued the Countess, “but I am sure you would be interested in the ancient and Warwick Castle is a magnificent old pile. 

You will be in England again soon day, will you not?” I expressed the hopes while before you fill me some again,” said the Countess, "Write me shortly when you settle on where you will be.”

But nobody was more interesting and more wonderful than Samuel Coleridge’s mother. She was an unusually amiable and chatty woman, and her son seemed to have adopted some of her qualities. She knew everything about the birds which flocked to her window, and she had a charming way of talking about them.
