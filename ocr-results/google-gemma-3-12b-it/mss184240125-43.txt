I came to Boston on Nov. 2
to make a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to begin. I have been very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the celebrated, they were
not worth seeing. I thought I should
see someone this spring, because the Peppers
said so, but has been a foggy winter,
but Bizzey & Violet are over the news.
Bizzey writes me often, & is happy
her lot of housework quite as usual.
But if she is what she is, she persists
in even duties. That the frets, the homely
chores. She has a good practical man, &
keeps her from every nuisance of things. Iaints
easy. Don’t you see – always.
Lovingly - Mamma dear.
