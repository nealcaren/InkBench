Steamer's predicted to get
the sailing but most
Company's direct yet knows

Mrin Baker wants to Come.
You will see at the Amsterdam
Study Conferences. She is a
very good speaker and

The real difficulties will
be that they all will want
come over for the days of
work in Washington, but they



cannot take extra
time to do sightseeing
in New-York – However,

Then we go to Stockholm in
October to might possibly
reach some more who
will want to go. We are also
trying to get some younger
women; but most of them
have jobs - and could
not afford the expense of
journey.
