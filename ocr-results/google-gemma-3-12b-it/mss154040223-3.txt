My dear Mr. Sayre:

Perhaps you know that I received the “Achievement Award” of $5000 from the Pictorial Review.  The achievement for which I am supposed to have received it was for Women Suffrage and Prison Woman Suffragette work.  It of course I did not achieve it alone – it was a collective victory.  Therefore, I have sent ten suffragists $100 each, or the first $1000 and more or less needy Peace Department or Organizations with Peace Departments. I have sent $100 each.  For myself, I have purchased an Encyclopedia Britannica and to the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War I have given all the rest of the award.

I have not heretofore contributed to your Organization though you know how sympathetic I am with its purposes. $100 is not much, but at any rate you have never received $100 like it before and probably will never again receive one like it; so do with it what you like for the good cause.

(Enclosure
$100 check)



Very truly yours,
