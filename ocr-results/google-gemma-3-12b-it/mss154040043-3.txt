Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
Woman’s Citizen Committee,

Dear Mrs. Catt:

As a member of the D.A.R., I am protesting against the propaganda with which the officers of the Society have adopted from Mrs. Robinson, F.A. Marvin, E.H. Hunter, etc. It occurs to me that it would be useful to be able to quote Mrs. Robinson’s anti-suffrage utterances as showing that in that campaign she was obsessed by the same fears and used the same arguments as send me clippings of her anti-suffrage orations or pamphlets. Can you send me any you direct me to where I might find these? I am very desirous of discredited Mrs. Robinson’s rank and file of members.

Can you give me any information about H.H.Mauldman, president of The Better America Federation, and president of the Pittsburgh Pipe and Supply Co., recently indicted for usury? I have been told the above facts, but have no details.

To me it seems a strange phenomenon that the officers of the D.A.R. have committed themselves to this propaganda, and I cannot help wondering if their affiliations are with the great corporations which are fighting change in industrial conditions. I know how the Diamond Match Company fought against giving up the use of phosphorus which produced "phossy jaw" in their unfortunate employees. The oil owners are fighting the Child Labor Amendment, and the D.A.R. opposed the Child Labor Amendment, passing resolution to that effect at their Congress in 1926, although the Chapters throughout the country had no opportunity to discuss this resolution beforehand – a resolution which I very much deplore. In the Report of the proceedings of the Congress of 1927, the delegate from North Carolina gave $1000 to Miss William Sherman Walker for use as Chairman of National Defense across “National Defense” propaganda, hence we only a red herring.

I say it is seeking to give you an idea of what is in the minds of those who all this to promote, and why I want to discredit Mrs. Robinson, and any others who are lending their influence to work acordingly in big business. The general charm of Wright’s leading articles is so skillfully done that one can’t but be impressed - in spite of his nonsense. I am certain that is why it has been adopted by the D.A.R. and is being circulated so widely.

I am very appreciative of your help, and wish you the very best of success in your great work.

Sincerely yours,

Mrs. Arthur Thayer,
