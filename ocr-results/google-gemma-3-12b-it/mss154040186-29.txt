just received, requests that I write you the answer to the questions that she has asked so that you will receive this letter before my meeting on Saturday morning.

My dear Mrs. Johnson,

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to congratulate you world war upon you; having you in it in all these eighty years to advance freedom and civilization.

You have been a recognized thinker and leader in many fields where men and women are proud to follow. My only regret is that the United States has not put the courage to elect a woman to the office of president. You have been my candidate for that place for many years. How proudly we should all have campaigned for you!

It is impossible to express adequately our women of all you have done for men and women of the whole world.

It is a great privilege and joy to work in the reigns in which you lead humanity to betterment.

I am thinking of yesterday’s lecture by Henry James, and over night came the news of the death of Dr. Richard Hurd. – I sat in the Congregational Church last evening and listened to a discussion of Burns’s poetry as read adroitly by Dr. Hurd. He was a man of very fine culture. He was a valued friend, and I shall miss him very much.

I am sending you a copy of the leaflet issued by Mr. John Dickinson entitled, "Why Women Should Vote." I know you have been interested in suffrage for many years, and I trust this will be helpful.

I am glad to send you a letter from Mrs. Stanley that I

I am sending requests that I write you the answer to the questions that she has asked so that you will receive this letter before my meeting on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place, at present, in which to provide a place and for maintenance. Because it could not arrange these matters, my own Library and that of the Associated Library are the only ones I can send it to. There are just completing a large addition to their building and are not cramped for space. I have told the Rooms Archives Committee that my collection will go to Washington. 

The Congressional Library is only interested in books, but at the Rollins Rooms we already have three very interesting gold-leafing cases representing the National American Woman Suffrage Association.

I have written Alice Stone Blackwell that we should be included. The Smithsonian is only interested in objects.  

In addition to these sentiments which I will add to the future of the place if I have so arranged it and upon the request of the Surfridge people. I feel I have had enough work.



I am enclosing a very pleasant letter from Hazel Newson. She is boarding with Miss Paynter, who has an apartment at 1177 Columbia Road. I saw Miss Paynter last week. 

I asked Mary if she would please write one of Mrs. Dexter’s place felt inadequate. It has been written.



With affection,

Louise



P.S. Mr. Livermore is going to see the effect of the National Woman’s Party.
