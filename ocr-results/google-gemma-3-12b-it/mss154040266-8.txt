February 6, 1911.

Dear Miss Peck,

In the “WOMAN’S JOURNAL” of next week there will be a statement concerning boarding houses, hotels and steamers, and this is the best I can do as early as that. I do not suppose you would be here so to do. I do not surprise you want to enjoy staying in Stockholm so long, but I'd not be there a while anyway.

There's a conference of the new Association in Christiania, March 13th-15th, and I think it would be wise to attend and meet these new suffragists, as you are so well versed in the tactics so useful at this time.

I have made my application to sail on the North German Lloyd, but if I fail there I shall try for a steam-er sailing the same date on the Hamburg American line. Miss Fa. is going with me. Do you want to go as early as that? It will be a great pleasure to have you go with us. I do not suppose you would enjoy remaining in Stockholm so long, but I'd not be there a while anyway.

I suppose you will be going to the World's Student Christian Federation Congress in Zurich. Is your room at the Zurich Hotel secured? 

Sincerely,

Annie C. Catt
