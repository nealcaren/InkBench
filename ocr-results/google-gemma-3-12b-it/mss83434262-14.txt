sober, ascertaining the address of his family, go with him to the express office and with his consent forward it to them, leaving him enough and pay his fare home and follow on after. We had several such cases.

Many ways of cheating the men were constantly practiced, and with the utmost vigilance we could hardly stop it; backed up as the rascals were by some of the judges elected by the people. A case reported in the Evening Post, of May 31st, in which Mr. Kennedy, our energetic and faithful Superintendent, was arrested for contempt of court, for not immediately letting one of these rascals go, is as follows:

THE ARREST OF MR. KENNEDY – CASE OF COLONEL COLYER AND THE JEWISH CLOTHIER ALKERS.

The fact of the arrest of Mr. Kennedy on a writ of contempt, issued by Judge CAMERON, and his subsequent detention, has already been published. The facts in relation to the arrest of MORRIS ALKERS, in whose behalf the writ of habeas corpus was issued, were not published. It appears that ALKERS keeps a clothing store in Canal street. On several occasions he has visited the Soldiers’ Depot corner of Howard and Mercer streets, where he distributed his business cards, which had a masonic emblem at the top.

By this means he secured a number of customers among the soldiers, and the Superintendent says he regularly cheated them, going with him once week ago last Sunday afternoon, ALKERS visited the depot during divine service, and persuaded eighty Eastern men a suit of clothes, ranging from fifty to one hundred and twenty dollars each. Three or four of these men went with the same evening. The next morning one of the others showed his clothing to the officers in the depot, and was told that he had been grossly deceived.

He was advised to go to Brookings Brothers and learn the value of the goods, which he did. He was informed that a suit of clothing for which he had paid eighty dollars could be bought for thirty dollars. Colonel COLYER then made the man refund to Superintendent Kennedy, when a detailed detective, retaining thirty dollars for the service. The other 50 was returned to the man.  Taking learning of the success of their campaign, the merchant and received more than half of the money they had originally paid. To encourage men ALKERS gave two suits of clothing rather than one.

At the rate of thirty dollars each, which is more than recommended by the quartermaster’s department, it is supposed that ALKERS has made a pretty good thing of it. he induced the men to buy of him, by telling them that he was a patriotic citizen, and that the money spent with him would go to aid in recruiting for the army.
