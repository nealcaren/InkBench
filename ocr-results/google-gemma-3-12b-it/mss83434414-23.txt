FREEDMEN’S BUREAU.

The friends of the freedman claim for him a weight of intellectual brain equal to his white fellow-man. A number of the medical officers interested in the cause are, when opportunity offers, many encouraging statistics will be added to the archives of the bureau. 

The officers of the medical staff in charge of the districts are entitled to great credit for efficient administration of medical affairs, a result anticipated from the facilities made by these staff departments of the bureau has relieved embarrassment and encouraged me in my official labors.

In concluding this report I beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the record at times afforded by the Commissioner to the medical branch of the bureau.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
 
Calvin W. Horner,
Surgeon United States Volunteers, Chief Medical Officer.

Little breaking up of the old plantation system has necessarily left the sick in the ordinary means of self-support, they will doubtless better versed than now aid. 

The medical officers of this bureau at the best can afford but partial relief. 

MISCELLANEOUS.

Of justice.—As all matters relating to refugees and freedmen were committed to my supervision and management by the law, and as the old void codes in several insurrections States had become practically null and void so far as they related to the negro. It became necessary to lay down some general rule for the relations of the bureau concerning the administration of justice. At first I confined myself to the following instructions:

“VI. Simple good faith, for which we hope on all hands from those concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve the Assistant Commissioners in the discharge of their duties towards the freedmen, as well as promote the general welfare. The Assistant Commissioners will, everywhere, declare and protect their freedom, as set forth in the proclamation of the President and the laws of Congress.

VII. VII. In places where there is an in violation of civil law, or in which the proclamation of freedom of coloreds is interfered with, the Commissioner by his official acts, by reason of these orders, in the execution of the law, do recognize and act as a civil court, until the establishment of regular civil courts.

VIII. All public officers, whether state, county, or municipal, will be required to acknowledge and respect the rights guaranteed to freedmen by law. 

IX. No freedman shall be required to perform labor without the expression of his own free will; and such labor shall be in accordance with contract - and that is, that they shall be protected in the enjoyment of the fruits of their labor.

X.  In all cases where the freedmen, or any person, make any charge of crime the civil authorities will be immediately communicated.

XI. It is a proper subject of the supervision of the bureau to ascertain if there can be established a regular police force among them. 

XII. To the end that the friends of the freedmen may be encouraged and sustained, an especially attention will be paid to a faithful and truthful rendering of the condition of things in every locality. 

XIII. The Assistant Commissioners will in all cases send prompt information to the Bureau of all important matters relating to this subject.”
