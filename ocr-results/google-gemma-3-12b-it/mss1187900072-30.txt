Washington April 10th 1887
Dear Father

Your letter dated March 24th I received yesterday; it found us all well, and I pleased to hear from you.

Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds is nervously sick with pneumonia. Gerrit S. Boguen is, and lawyers are much but about it.

Senator Sherman is making a trip South in Georgia. A colored delegation called on Bishop Walker from Kansas has been appointed to look as present on the Republican side is wavering, between Blaine and Sherman. Congress has made an appropriation for a paper of Deeds. The President, Treasurer, Matthias have been taken back in the rump Confirmation of Mrs. Trotter. They expected he would be rejected by Lawyer.
