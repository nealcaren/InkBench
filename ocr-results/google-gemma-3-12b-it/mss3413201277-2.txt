**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It is a review of the condition of the country, with recommendations for legislation on various subjects. The tone is one of optimism, and the general conclusion is that the nation is in a prosperous and contented state.

**FINANCE AND COMMERCE.**

The President commends the financial policy of the administration, and expresses the opinion that it has contributed to the prosperity of the country. He recommends that the laws relating to national banks be amended so as to provide for the retirement of the remaining four per cent bonds, and that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to issue bonds to replace them. He also suggests that the laws relating to the coinage of silver be revised, so as to provide for the free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.

The President recommends that Congress pass laws to regulate the hours of labor in factories and workshops, and to protect the health and safety of workingmen. He also suggests that the laws relating to the transportation of goods by rail and water be amended so as to prevent unjust discrimination against shippers.

**THE CIVIL SERVICE.**

The President reiterates his support for the civil service reform, and recommends that the law relating to the matter be extended to all departments of the government. He also suggests that a permanent civil service commission be established to administer the law.

**THE INDIANS.**

The President expresses his regret at the recent outbreak of hostilities on the frontier, and recommends that Congress provide for the adequate protection of settlers and the suppression of the Indians. He also suggests that efforts be made to civilize and educate the Indians, and to assimilate them into the body of the nation.

**FOREIGN RELATIONS.**

The President expresses his satisfaction with the friendly relations between the United States and other nations.
