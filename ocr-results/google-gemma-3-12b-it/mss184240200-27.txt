I knew a good vessel when
I hear it!! I sent Lattie
her Jumin when Iâ€™m absent,
surely a proper one when I
have the same occasion to injure
as he - 

I don't know why you
wanted it!! I sent some
of a letter from my western
friend but I enclose a
copy - 

Goodbye
again
with heartfelt
kisses for your health
specially if you think of
seeing the vigor of a
New England Summer next
July -
