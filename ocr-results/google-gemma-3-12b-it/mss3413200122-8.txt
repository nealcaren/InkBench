trusted to perform our own ablutions instead of being watched by an official hired to mutter prayers while we bathe.

Nothing could be more illogical or more unwise than to trust to the voice of Biologists specially; nothing could be more futile than to hope to stop it while we treat it so; the eruption of scarlatina, treating the spots as the sole seat of the disease. Vivisection, as I said, is the outcome of an intellectual disease, which vivisection would whole scientific thought are those undone.

We have, in the Province of Thought, a law as certain as any of the laws of nature, namely, that all motion tends to the production of thought.  The Laws of Thought are as much the laws of the Universe as the Laws of Gravity.  The Laws of Thought are the universal laws of all existence.  That is to say, the laws of the Universe, as we understand it, are the laws of Thought. It is the intellectual habit which in all the actions of men, even in the most rudimentary, is found to enter as an element.  The habit being once formed, it is impossible to extinguish it.

life, according to the Laws of Thought. But in the second place, it would seem that the Laws of Thought–the laws of the machine called brain–are in some special sense the key to the Law of all vital forces. Newton, for instance, discovered the Law of gravity, not by observing stars more than many others were doing, but by studying and keeping the Laws of Thought; and especially that central one: Universe of Thought equals Unity. Having trained his brain in the habit of acting squarely in accordance with its laws, he compared what was known about the movement of the stars which he could not reach, with the motions of objects within his grasp; and thus was led to perceive the action, throughout creation, of that law of gravitation.

Our own departments of education fill the air with the bluster of novelties, without any real perception of the laws which govern the movements of the human mind.  They teach that we are to be trusted to our own devices; that is to say, they are in the habit of trusting to the voice of sensation.  But sensation is merely the raw material of thought; and sensation can do nothing without thought.  Trusting to sensation is like trusting to the voice of the ocean instead of the ships that sail upon it.  The Laws of Thought are the laws of the Universe.  The Law of Thought that is a planet



that disease is, resistance to believing such of them as we cannot help knowing; jealousy of the intellectual power acquired by those who adhere to them better than we do ourselves; terror at the blaze of light than those laws throw on the whole of our life on earth. Every Schoolmaster and Bishop in this country does something to promote a state of things which vivisection is the natural and inevitable outcome.  We are guilty, too, in our own degree; you, and I, everybody. Everyone of us can do something to improve that state of things, and to create a condition in which vivisection would be comfortably useless and therefore contemptible.

What we have to do for that purpose is to cultivate steadily a habit of treating our own Universe of Thought, scientifically and those around us. 



The Laws of Thought are those immense minds discovery of ourselves, not in connection with the bodies, but in connection with the intellect.  Within us is a world; and the brain had out of it.  The Laws of Thought are the laws of the Universe.  The brain is a machine, - a thinking machine, - and we must learn to study its laws.
