Washington, D. C., April 11, 1903
609-F st. n.w.

Mr. B.F.Leigh ton,
Dear Sir:

In reply to the 6th inst. was
duly received, the contents of which was care-
fully noted by Mr. Lewis Douglass.
In your letter, thou desires me to make any change
regarding a time step on the premises referred
to in our last.

On the contrary, he desires Mr. Nelson
Douglass, attention called to the fact that
said premises is in immediate need of improvements
in and out, walls, the broken blinds, and
especially the Sanitary apartments, make it
almost unbearable. It is sadly in need of a
coat of paint, which in its present position,
makes a most deplorable appearance.

It is the only residence in that immediate
neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to
the Landlord.
Respectfully yours,
Joseph Douglass
3518 Clerk.
