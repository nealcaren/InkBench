THE SUNDAY MORNING STAR.

**President's Extraordinary Reception in Richmond – The Immense Crowd – Touching Scenes – Return to Washington – The Enthusiastic Greetings Along the Route**

Richmond, Va., Feb. 14 – The most remarkable and touching exhibition ever witnessed in this city occurred yesterday in the official reception of President Cleveland. The day dawned cold and dreary, threatening snow, but the people of Richmond persevered in their preparations, and as the morning advanced the sky cleared, and the sun shone out brightly.

Early in the forenoon the streets leading to the state capitol, where the formal reception was to be held, were filled with people, and as the hour of 12 o'clock drew near the crowd increased until it was estimated that 25,000 persons were gathered about the capitol grounds. Along Broad street, Monument avenue, and Grace street, as far as the eye could reach, stood dense masses of humanity, and the sidewalks were completely blocked with eager sightseers. 

A large number of ladies of Richmond, dressed in white and wearing badges of red, white, and blue, were stationed at the capitol, and as the carriages approached, they were showered with bouquets and calenulas. A large number of negro citizens were also present, and they were noted for their patriotic display.

The procession formed at the terminus of the canal near the Southern rail road depot, and included nearly every civic and military organization in the city. 

Funeral services of Mrs. McCord were over with a brisk effort. 

The President came from Washington on the 7:18 train, and was met at the terminus of the canal by Governor Terrell, Senator A. B. Woodward, and Bishop K. Nelson, and escorted to the executive mansion.

A grand parade was formed, and as soon as the President arrived at the capitol building, it passed along Broad street, lined with excited people, south to the corner of Monument avenue and Broad street, where the procession was reviewed by the President, and then returned to the executive mansion. 

In the procession there was a display of military, civic, educational and industrial organizations. A unique feature of the parade was the appearance of a company formed of the senior and junior class of the Merrimac school, dressed in blue uniforms and carrying small flags. The company of negro boys from the African Union church, also deserves mention. 

The presentation of a portrait of George Washington to the President occurred in the parlor of the executive mansion, in the presence of a large number of ladies and gentlemen. Before the presentation was made, a brief address was delivered by Judge Norment. The portrait was then presented by Dr. William Fitzwilliam, who alluded to the struggles of our forefathers and predicted that whenever the principles of American liberty are faithfully observed, liberty would endure. 

Speeches were also delivered by Governor Terrell and Mr. William Marsh, who both spoke of the importance of preserving the principles of the fathers. President Cleveland responded in a few well-chosen words, expressing his thanks for the presentation and stating that he would through life guard the principles of American liberty. 

A magnificent dinner was served at the Ballard hotel, and among the guests were Governor Terrell, Senator A. B. Woodward, Bishop K. Nelson, Judge Norment, Drs. J.W. McDougal, William Fitzwilliam, and many others. 

After supper, the President and party proceeded to the Southern rail road depot, where a special train awaited them. When the President appeared on the depot platform, the crowd gave three hearty cheers, and as the train pulled out, hats were waved, handkerchiefs were unfurled, and a general demonstration of enthusiasm was manifested. 

The President’s trip to Richmond was a success in every way. All anxieties for his personal safety were removed, and the function was conducted in a manner exceedingly satisfactory to the people of Richmond and to the nation at large.
