My dear Mrs. Catt:

May I thank you for your delightful letter as well as for the I.I.L. check? I am sure it will cause much rejoicing in our ranks.

With congratulations to the judges of the award upon their discriminating choice, and to you upon your method of expenditure, I am

Faithfully yours,

Jane Addams.

The entire world is poorer because of the passing of that great and noble soul, Jane Addams. She strengthened, encouraged, and cheered the right side of every question. Just, logical, and unafraid, she has changed the thinking of the world on many questions. Instead of grieving for her passing, let us rejoice that she has lived.
