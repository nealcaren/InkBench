My dear Steady: I thank you for his
letters and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs. Blinn. I thank you especially for the clip-
pings for as you suspect I have <ins>been</ins> interested
in the outgoing task year, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention.  Satrin, Mrs. Sweat brought
a letter she had received from Effie Vance,
and she had described very vividly how
Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her
suffering through Christian Science.  Suddenly
excited in Ch. Si. Mrs. B. was one of the most
generous and forgiving women I ever
met, and with the same <ins>rich</ins> office, she was
a woman to be admired for very many
estimable qualities.
