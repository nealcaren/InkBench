MOONEY AND BILLINGS

there at 1:50 P.M. That was my recollection of the time, and I was and am very sure that was the time I saw the suitcase placed there.

About a week before the trial of Thomas J. Mooney, Assistant District Attorney Ed. Cunha said to me, “You had better make the time you saw the suitcase set at 1:30 that would give them time to get back up Mission Street, on top of the Elders Building,” which was about a mile away from the place of the explosion.

Before the trial of Tom Mooney, Fickert told me that Cunha was going to try the case, and that I should go through with Cunha, and act under his instructions; that perhaps there would have to be some small changes in my testimony, that perhaps there would be some worth $100,000 and that he would get the District Attorney’s offce I left the witness stand and was an Osman was on the witness stand. I heard one of the clerks say “Mr. Duncan wants the witness’s off-

Before the Weinberg case came up Cunha read over my testimony to me and said if they ask you if you saw an automobile at Stuart and Market Streets that time you say, “yes,” “I think I did,” and if they ask you what kind of a machine it was, “I think it was a Ford.” After I left the witness stand in the Weinberg trial Cunha said to me, “Why in hell didn’t you say you saw a machine? It would have been all right.”

MOONEY AND BILLINGS
Judge Griffin's Appeal to the Governor

Hon. C. C. Young, Governor of California,
Sacramento, California



My Dear Governor – When you discussed the Mooney case some weeks ago with a group of citizens at Berkeley, you told us that until then you had believed Mooney and Billings guilty of the Preparedness crime. They deny it.





I believe that if you are as anxious as any other citizen of California to see justice done to these two men, and will give generous attention to the documents in behalf of their pardon. Because I believe that, Governor Young I am asking you—before you make your final decision—to let me know what evidence has led you to believe that Mooney and Billings really committed the crime for which they were tried and convicted and are now in prison.

The thing that happened on Preparedness Day twelve years ago was a terrible crime, but I am sure that you will also consider it a terrible crime to imprison two humans who belong were mount-fairly, even criminally, connected and that will wish to give those who believe them to have a misapprehension of justice every opportunity to have their cases reconsidered in view of the many facts there are.

Any resident familiar with this county knows that the testimony of three eyewitnesses should then would be considered sufficient for conviction. But in the Mooney case, with thirty-six witnesses—body and all— and with doubt in the minds of many, it would be more consistent with justice though it would be most embarrassing to admit that a mistake was made, to concede that a doubt exists.

I am asking you, as I have asked you before, to investigate this case.

Very respectfully yours,

FRANK C. GRIFFIN
Judge Emeritus—Superior Court of San Francisco County
