Following the example of all elders I want to give one
bit of advice, still I want to leave with you one fact which I 
have learned as the result of my life's experience. I do not
expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may re-
member then charge her in the idle fantasy of a discontented mind,
that it is more—more

Each of you young people—the thing I want to impress upon
a special impression you had from a low-minded woman—
—that it is not at this moment in need of land- 
one-and-a-half acres—I would ask all of you—refermers—you will find
that you stand, you will stand, I am asking you to this: whatever
your life's ambition may stand, it must stand fast. 

There is a law of evolution—you have learned much of
that during your life in colleges. 

Know this—the world is shifting. We are  regarding it as a
matter of necessity, I am speaking not of necessity, but
a duty, I am speaking of requirement. 

It is our requirement which certain concerns are
acting upon. 

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from
indignation; nor is it the idle fantasy of a discontented mind. 
It is the upward tendency of mind. 

The young, the youthful, the tender, the soft minds, the world has 
been always demanding that which it may believe. 
Know this, we have taught you to be a popularity in 
all you alone in all the 
proposition all the detail which has no thing to do with the 
action. 

You, sons and daughters of Wyoming, you have the 
immortal example of your state to follow. For fifty-two years
ago, the territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone
geography, and I remember my sup with that great yellow spotch 
which included Wyoming, and it was called the Great American 
Desert. The granting of votes in some unknown state in
that great desert had little influence on the outside world. That
good thing could come out of a desert! But time brought influence
to Wyoming, and then the world cheered it. I am sure there never
have been men who had as delightful political conventions and as
delegates to Congress as the breed that would defend that Wyoming
torch flame, to march in, the better life and bring you descend
those years at a single instant. 

I do not know, in all 
the history, who never failed, when remember. For the world
needed, and they appeared in the vote of Wyoming, 
without a strain. 

We are living today in a city of beautiful geography, studying
your life kindly, I am content to wait. I long for the morrow. 

There is a law of evolution—you have leaned much of 
that during your life in colleges.
