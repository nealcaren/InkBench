ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammelled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman to obtain a medical degree, and another was the first to be ordained a minister. Her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to college; become a lecturer against slavery, spurred to suffrage work and, later, aided in the organization and movement for women’s rights, though her life was one of the half-dozen great national figures sacrificed to revolution. From this inheritance of service to the woman's cause.

The life of the daughter was interwoven from childhood in the lady-like virtues of her mother-in-law, Alice Blackwell was assistant or editor-in-chief of the *Woman’s Journal* for thirty-three years; President of the New England Woman Suffrage Association for absent years, and President of the New England Woman's Press Association.  Its needs are *its* **pride.**
