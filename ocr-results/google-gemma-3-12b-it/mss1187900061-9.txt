instead of making merely
me Biscuits, I would try
send you a line. I hope
you will excuse Bad Writing
and Spelling as you will
find I have worn Miss
Boyer twice since you
left. Every thing is going
on just the same as I have
you think so nerves to tell
you all are well at
home hoping that
you are. Rosa is well
and sends love to you.

Trusty your
friend
