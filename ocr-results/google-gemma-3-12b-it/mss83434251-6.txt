“We have some Negros; and in look on them, in general, equally serviceable with other men for fatigue; and in action many of them have proved themselves brave.

“I would avoid all reflection, or any thing that may tend to give umbrage; but there is in this army from the southward a number called riflemen, who are as indifferent men as ever lived. These privates are meritorious, and often deserting to the enemy; unwilling for duty of any kind; exceedingly vicious; and I think the army here would be as well without as with them.” —M. S. Letter, dated 24th October, 1775.

October 23d, 1777:

“From here to Springfield, there are few habitations which have not an house at a Negro family dwelling in a small house near by. The Negros are here as fruitful as they are still calves. The young ones are well foddered, especially while they are likely men.” —Schlozer's Briefwechsel, vol. i., p. 365.

We next give an extract from an act of the “State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, in General Assembly, February Session, 1778. “Whereas, for the preservation of the rights and liberties of the United States, it is necessary that the whole powers of Government should be exerted in recruiting the Continental battalions; and whereas made to him by Brigadier-General Varnum, to enlist into the two battalions, raising by this State, such slaves as should be willing to enter into the service; and whereas history affords us frequent precedents of the wise, the free, and brave nations having liberated their slaves and enlisted them as soldiers to fight under their country; and whereas, the enemy, to gratify a spirit, have taken possession of all property, and plundered the houses, towns, and possessions of the citizens in general—therefore, We, the representatives of the State of Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations, in general assembly assembled, enact, as follows:—

“That all able-bodied slaves, who are willing to enter into the service of the United States, may be enlisted into either of the two battalions above mentioned; and that they shall be fitted and equipped as other soldiers are.”
