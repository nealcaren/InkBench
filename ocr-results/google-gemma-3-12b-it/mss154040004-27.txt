The functions including the union of S. A. and two places in Rhodesia. I conducted the entire correspondence arranging for the trip, engaging hotels, etc. and wrote many letters concerning the convention held in Durban. Several towns invited us to visit them and these invitations I had to decline. I think this part of the work was more arduous than any of the party comprehended. The statistics which follow apply to myself alone, as program followed was not quite in agreement with two of us.

I made 13 public speeches, each exceeding one hour. I made 8 written letters sent over receptions; 18 luncheons, 3 being given by Mayors of Pretoria, Johannesburg and Durban, one by Mrs. Botha, wife of the Premier, one by Mrs. Hill, wife of Minister of Finance; I attended 12 afternoon teas; 3 morning teas; 6 dinner; 9 sessions; 11 committee meetings.

The town is full of life and the defunct missions that are deserted also show how doughty saved the South Africans propose and also to be saved.
