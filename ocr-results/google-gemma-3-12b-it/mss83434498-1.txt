SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, APRIL 7, 1865. My dear wife, with a slight modification of the last letter, I send it to you. I have nothing of special interest to communicate, but I thought it would be a pleasure to hear from you and to let you know that I am quite well, and doing all I can to help our cause.

We first entered the Fort the 4th inst., and have been here ever since. The rebels have about 6 miles in front of us, but they are not very particular; that is to say that a man can get within 100 yards or less of their lines without being shot. They donâ€™t seem to care much about defending this place. There are a good many cavalry here, and a few artillery, but not enough to do proper defence. Our regiment is the oldest in the department and is nearly all veteran soldiers.

Our supplies are coming in slowly. It rains nearly every day, and the roads are so muddy that it is difficult to get anything. The company is hard pressed for writing material; it is more difficult to obtain paper than anything else here. I suppose writing material is plenty in the North.

We are awaiting orders. The troops are all tired, and it will be a pleasant time when they can rest. They have been marching and fighting nearly constantly. I have had no opportunity to join the forces with whom I should like to be, but I hope to be there shortly. There is an engineer's corps here with whom I belong. We are endeavoring to assist in tunneling under the enemy's works, but thus far we have made no great progress. The rebels are quite suspicious of us and the negroes who know a little about tunneling are all valuable. They are working and are assisting us in cutting the trenches. 

There is a large number of negroes working with us. There are a great many who are assisting us in this way, but they are all valuable. They are entrusted with the construction of torpedoes. The rebels are attempting to drive us back with their gunboats which tow a sort of floating battery. This arrangement is very effective. The negroes have constructed a lot of torpedoes and many more are under construction. 

We fought one of them the other day, and the result was quite satisfactory. They are preparing to retreat, and it is reported are going to be pulled out. I suspect that is the case, for they will not be able to hold this place much longer. 

I am anxious to see you and all of our friends. I hope to see you soon.

Yours affectionately,
W.A. Avery.
