Dear Sir,

Francis A. Addington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age sends the following
offerings for the Lincoln Monument circulation.

This Monument would seem to say
that Lincoln lived, but tried to die.
In vain the accolades arm to play.
In vain the floods of patriotic flow.
Hard while a chip of gratitude show
Shall flow in any human frame
twice that at memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln.

This Monument we raise to thee
Great Chief whose Maker Made us free.
Our grateful hearts to heaven ascend
For thee, our true and constant friend.
Also the following:
"Accept to America Personified,"
The Word is gaping on thee.
Disclose thy secrets with care
And with thy precious jewels
A crown thy golden hair.
