**FINANCE AND COMMERCE.**

The President commends the financial policy of the Administration, and expresses the opinion that it has contributed largely to the prosperity of the country. He recommends that the laws relating to national banks be amended so as to provide for the retirement of the remaining four per cent bonds, and that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to issue bonds to take their place. He also suggests that the laws relating to the coinage of silver be revised, so as to provide for the free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.

The President recommends that Congress pass laws to protect commerce on the high seas, and to secure to American citizens the same rights and privileges that are enjoyed by citizens of other nations. He also suggests that the laws relating to patents be amended so as to encourage invention and promote the arts and sciences.

**THE CIVIL SERVICE.**

The President reiterates his support of the civil service reform movement, and recommends that the law passed by the last Congress be extended to all departments of the government. He also suggests that a civil service commission be created to administer the law and to enforce its provisions.

**THE INDIANS.**

The President expresses his regret at the recent outbreak on the White River Agency, and recommends that Congress provide for the punishment of the Indians who participated in the outbreak. He also suggests that the policy of the government toward the Indians be revised, so as to provide for their civilization and assimilation.
