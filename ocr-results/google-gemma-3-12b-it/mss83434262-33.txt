Crossing the harbor, the steamer pushed rapidly for Bedloeâ€™s Island, and we were soon ashore for a brief ramble. Col. Chas. S. Merchant, of the regular army, received the ladies, several of whom had resided on the island in the days of hospitals and of battles, being very short, they contented themselves with a hasty glimpse of the sea and land and climbed the upper windows of the visit and Fort Lafayette, "a commodity" beside some 30 patients. The hospitals are nearly all empty, and are soon to be pulled down. Everything is in admirable order, and as clean as a pin. Dr. Philip Adolphus, U. S. A., is in charge.

FORT LAFAYETTE. 
Heading down the harbor our little craft was soon fairly on her way toward Fort Lafayette, which forbidding structure was famous during the war as the prison of those who had committed overt acts of treason against the sovereign power of our government. Passing Staten Island, whose beautiful scenery attracted the eye and refreshed the senses, we kept upon the even tenor of our way; enjoying the cool and bracing sea breeze as it came dancing over the waves, from Sandy Hook. Saluting passing steamers with shrill whistles, waving handkerchiefs to a mail steamship, just coming from over the Atlantic, the passengers, no doubt glad to see him, at last bundling themselves on the deck of Fort Lafayette. Receiving a kind invitation to land, we walked up one more run out, or rather up the ladder safely floated up the porous ascent by Gaining the interior, we were escorted through the corridor by Lieut. Smith, and to the quarters of Bracket Biggs, Surgeon, U.S.A., and visiting, if not at our leisure, at least to our satisfaction. 

The officers are doing everything in their power to make the fort a pleasant resort.
