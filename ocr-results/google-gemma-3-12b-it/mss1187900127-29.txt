**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.**

The President’s message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It is a review of the condition of the country, with recommendations for legislation on various subjects. The tone is one of optimism, and the general conclusion is that the nation is in a prosperous and contented state.

**FINANCE AND COMMERCE.**

The President commends the financial policy of the Administration, and expresses the opinion that it has contributed largely to the prosperity of the country. He recommends that the laws relating to national banks be amended so as to provide for the retirement of the remaining four per cent bonds, and that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to issue bonds to take their place. He also suggests that the laws relating to the coinage of silver be revised, so as to provide for the free and unlimited coinage of silver, and that the silver coinage be made legal tender for all debts, public and private.

The President recommends that Congress pass laws to protect commerce on the high seas, and to prevent piracy and other unlawful acts. He also suggests that the laws relating to the navigation of the rivers and harbors of the country be amended so as to provide for the improvement of these waterways.

**THE CIVIL SERVICE.**

The President reiterates his support of the civil service reform movement, and recommends that Congress pass laws to extend the operation of the civil service act to all departments of the government. He also suggests that the civil service commission be given greater power to enforce the law.

**THE INDIANS.**

The President expresses his regret at the recent outbreak of hostilities on the frontier, and recommends that Congress provide for the adequate protection of the settlers. He also suggests that the policy of the government toward the Indians be revised, so as to provide for their civilization and education.

**THE NAVY.**

The President recommends that Congress provide for the construction of a new navy, and that the existing ships be thoroughly repaired and refitted. He also suggests that the navy be increased in number, so as to be able to protect the commerce of the country and to defend the nation’s honor.
