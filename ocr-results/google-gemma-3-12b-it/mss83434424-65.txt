EMANCIPATION AND COLONIZATION.

The city of Carmen has about 5,000 inhabitants; its aspect from the port is very picturesque and beautiful. Mariners, on their entering, may be guided by a fine fixed light in the Indian village opposite the place, which light can be seen fourteen miles at sea. The principal commerce of this town consists in the extraction of logwood, the annual exportation of which is from four to six hundred thousand quintals. The price generally ranges from 75 cents to $1.25, according to the demand, or the great or small supply in the market.

The logwood is carried to Carmen in canoes of from four hundred to a thousand quintals burden, from Tabaneiy, Gibilbo, Ranchos, Chumpan, the Ranchos of the East, Palisada, and principally from all the ranchos on the river Usumacinta, passing through Palisada. The interior of the country is generally swampy, and its greatest production to-day is logwood. There is also in the interior of the country a large quantity of cedar, mahogany, and, until now, other kinds have not been an object of great extraction or exportation.

There are at present ten or twelve establishments for the elaboration of sugar and aguardiente (sugarcane rum,) and with time these articles may be produced in abundance for exportation.

What is now considered as the territory of Carmen has about 20,000 inhabitants.

If the country was more thickly populated, so as to facilitate labor for agricultural pursuits, it would probably be one of the richest facto in the world.

Steam communications could be established from Carmen to the rivers of Palizada, Chumpan, Candelaria, Mamantal, and Ca√±o de Tabanney, by deepening a little the bars of these rivers, which could be done without any great outlay, and with lucrative results to any one who would undertake the enterprise. The distance by sea from Vera Cruz to Laguna is two hundred and seventy miles; from Laguna to Frontera de Tabasco, by sea, sixty-eight miles; or to San Juan Batista one hundred and fourteen miles by sea and river.

The logwood a fraction above the Sierra is called "green logwood;" and that which is taken from "the plains" is called "red logwood." The former is preferred, and commands a higher price. The planters, to safe-guard themselves against cheatings, make a specific test, and only accept that of which the water yields a violet blue.

The number of vessels that arrive here annually to load is from fifty to seventy; they remain from fifteen to thirty days, and generally take in from four to six thousand quintals each. The emigrants arrive here from all parts of the world, and those coming from the United States are generally from New Orleans and Vera Cruz.
