FREEDMEN’S BUREAU. 47

and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, the Assistant Commissioners of this bureau will at once make careful estimates of the amounts of provisions, clothing, &c., as may be needed for the present quarter for the supply of such classes of persons as may be within their respective departments, and they will hereafter, quarterly, make like estimates. All estimates must be approved by the Commissioner of the bureau prior to issue.

Rations, fuel, transportation, and quarters have been heretofore furnished to such persons, by certain commanders of departments, posts, &c., while others have refused to furnish the same. Therefore, in order that there may be uniformity of action and a clear understanding in this matter, the following rules will be adopted, and will take effect and be in force on and after July 1, 1865, to wit:

Rations will not be regularly issued to teachers of refugees or freedmen, or to other persons voluntarily laboring for the benefit of such persons, but such teachers as are authorized by the Assistant Commissioners of this bureau, while actually on duty in their fields of labor, may purchase rations from the government precisely in the same rules which apply to such purchases when made by commissioned officers of the army.

Free transportation will be granted to such teachers on government transports and military railroads only.

Public buildings or buildings that may have been seized from disloyal owners, not required for military purposes, may be used for occupation for schools, teachers, soldiers’ wives, and refugees.

Major General, Commissioner Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, &c.
