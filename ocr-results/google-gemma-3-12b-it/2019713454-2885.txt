EDITOR'S PORTFOLIO.


We have received a number of let-
ters from young correspondents who
land booteers, what Morris-
land bootees--to whalers, is to
children. Oscar Pletsch is more
than his painter, interpreter, immortalizer. It has been said that
Pletsch has never had a superior, and
probably not an equal, in his specialty
of sketching children. For presenting
the American public with the dear-
ings of this admirable artist, Miss
Seaverns deserves the thanks of all
lovers of art. If you would, obtain a
idea of Pletsch's genius, his humor,
truth, geniality, and beauty, — get a set
of “The Nursery,” and carefully exam-
ine the dressings. The society a
Hard, Day's" – Copy Professor
want to know about—they send us sub-
scriptions, and send their nice silver
knit another to present to her dear
grandmother; so she sends three more,
and get another little-knit. Another
little girl wanted a crochet set, and
sist us twenty little books, note-paper, so
have all twentys, readers, help us to
establish "THE NURSERY" prosper-
ous? Get a universal work?
