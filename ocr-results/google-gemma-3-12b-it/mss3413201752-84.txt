APOLOGY

A grandson reminded us that if we prepared a Quiz on only one book of the Bible yearly, we were 145 years to complete our task we must live until we were 145 years old.

So we planned to hasten and put into one booklet the questions on Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. We were encouraged by kind words from friends like Mrs. Wendell Greene who called our last, with story attached, "a carefully documented outline of an ancient story, in which social, economic, legal and religious problems are etched against a romantic background with an undertone of the ethical teachings of the Great Law-giver. If you underline accurate citations from the Bible with a true-blue pencil and make no error, you will receive “Honorable Mention.”

We admit that the names of the husbands of the Daughters, Akam, Becer, Bekar, Dekar and Ekar are not given in the Bible nor does the Bible tell us of the various conversations of the Daughters, as noted in this Dialogue, but why should not the girls have talked about the great Jewish Lawgiver, about their family property and their future husbands?

Their marriages remind us of our own Effy-four years ago because our sons and daughters were not honored by the presence of Moses, but modern literature, but the knowledge they’d get that different, however, Rev. Anna Howard Shaw.

The crowd should know that some women have always known more than “a woman’s work is to homemaking” and teaching children.

We are grateful to those who encourage us to continue our work.

ZELOPHEHAD'S DAUGHTERS

A Dialogue
In four scenes
Time: about 1452 B.C. 
Place: Tent of Zelophehad in the Wilderness Authorities: Num. XXVI, 33; XXVII, 1–11; XXVIII, 15; Josh. VII, 3–6 and I Chron. VII, 15 besides many verses from the Pentateuch.

Speakers: The five daughters of Zelophehad—Hoglah, Milcah, Noah, curious Tirzah, attentive Milcah, and petted Tirzah.

Scene I

Milcah. This went is only home we ever knew, and how do we miss father?

Tirzah. More than you missed mother? Hoglah. Oh no, but you were two too young to remember her. Father made a pet of you, Tirzah, and was so proud when you had learned all the Ten Commandments.

Noah. We older daughters were taught largely by our parents but Mahlah has been a real mother and teacher of you younger girls, Milcah and Tirzah. Mother used to say that if the first child were carefully taught, she would be one of the best teachers of the younger children.

Tirzah. You, Mahlah, have proved all you ever fight for your faithfully trained girls are children you intentionally, honored by your instruction.

Noah. Our shepherd, Jacob, taught your brothers the burden and care each would bear, and that we must always be ready to give our assistance when needed.
