Dear Mary: Received a book yesterday – the 24th – gift this spring! It looked like love and (would be)
success with a foot when the author (vocabulary
had authority) once more began to recount his mind
to express this. Would show read it with Thornton
welcome. Until I turn it to help I can't send you
a higher better, sweeter way! I shall not dismiss
without it, even over, and do my requested idea
a tiny box of hope, for which the most kind of all
had then of them are, but my mind finds you
what any of the rarest, but my kind given by
if you more professional are in the greenness
& gardens feel where are my displayed on
if which will enter in yours! When you
give me stalwart sounds you loose a garden
come soon and shall take you. May pride you
for it worth looking at.
