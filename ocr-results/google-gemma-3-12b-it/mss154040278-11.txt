**THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.**

The President's message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it does not present any startling or sensational recommendations, it is full of matter that will demand the careful consideration of the legislative body.

**The Tariff Question.**

The tariff question is, as might have been expected, the most prominent feature of the message. The President expresses the opinion that the existing tariff laws are not satisfactory, and that a revision is necessary. He does not, however, enter into a detailed discussion of the subject, but simply states that he is of the opinion that the tariff should be so adjusted as to promote the interests of American industry and to secure a just and equitable distribution of the burdens of taxation.

**The Currency Question.**

The currency question is also touched upon in the message. The President expresses the opinion that the existing currency system is not perfect, and that some changes are desirable. He suggests that the Government should issue bonds in exchange for the silver coinage, and that these bonds should be redeemable in gold. This proposal is intended to provide a more stable and reliable currency, and to prevent the fluctuations in the value of silver that have been experienced in recent years.

**Civil Service Reform.**

The President reiterates his support for civil service reform, and urges Congress to pass legislation that will provide for the appointment of Government officials on the basis of merit. He believes that such a reform would improve the efficiency of the Government service and would reduce the opportunities for political corruption.

**Foreign Affairs.**

The President touches briefly upon foreign affairs. He expresses his desire for the maintenance of peace and amity with all nations, and he urges Congress to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the interests of American citizens abroad. He also refers to the recent disturbances in China, and expresses his hope that the situation will be settled in a manner that will secure the rights and safety of all foreigners.

**Other Matters.**

The message also deals with a number of other matters, including the Indian question, the public lands, the improvement of the rivers and harbors, and the national debt. The President recommends that Congress take steps to provide for the better education of the Indians, to protect the public lands from encroachment, to improve the navigation of the rivers and harbors, and to reduce the national debt.

**A Conservative Document.**

In general, the President's message is a conservative document. It does not propose any radical changes in the existing order of things, but rather seeks to improve the existing system by making moderate and well-considered reforms. It is a message that is likely to be well received by the country at large, and it is certain to provoke a lively debate in Congress.
