The witnesses were refused service at the Thompson cafeteria on Feb. 28, 1950 on the ground that three of the group were colored, by Mr. S.W. Becker, regional superintendent of the "Washington-Baltimore district of the Thompson chain.

According to a ruling of the corporation counsel, the law against discrimination for color in restaurants is now in effect, but no further prosecutions will be enacted until the courts have ruled on the Thompson case. Some restaurants have opened their doors to all patrons since last November, but BLSA reported that 21, 1950 through the corporation counsel, that the law is still in effect. The "Washington Restaurant Assn. has advised its members not to obey the law at present.

An amicus curiae brief will be filed by the Coordinating Committee for the D.C. chapter of the Natl. Lawyers Guild published an opinion in May 1949 holding that the laws have never been repealed and has been considered solely with their being put into effect. The amicus brief reviews the changing and inconsistent segregation pattern in the nation since 1949, and cites decisions on employment. The attorney general’s office opposes the bill.

The Coordinating Committee lists as members: the N.Y. Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Congress, and the Workers Defense League.

A recent Thompson Co. report says, “Thompson never intended to discriminate.” King says Thompson’s attorney, Wilmer C. Stone, has advised his client to comply.

The Stone & Ketchum Co. is representing the Thompson chain.

Held during the Thompson case, three national anti-discrimination organizations are contacting hotels, restaurants and theatres in Washington to determine their policy on serving colored patrons.

A formal hearing on the Thompson case, which will be transcribed, will be held before Municipal Court Judge J. Harry McQueston. 

The D.C. Anti-Discrimination Law, passed in 1872 and amended in 1873, states that “all persons within the District shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of all amusements, places of public resort, and all places of instruction, and shall not be subjected to any discrimination.”
