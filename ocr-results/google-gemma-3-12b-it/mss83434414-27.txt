FREEDMEN’S BUREAU.

SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.

General Rufus Saxton had, as you are aware, been during most of the war in charge of matters pertaining to freedmen in South Carolina. The operations of the war enabled me to visit Beaufort and St. Helena islands during the winter of 1864–65, and I was pleased with the settlement, labor, regulations, and thriving schools that I found in existence under his direction and supervision. Several armies, were received by him, for the most part, in a state of utter destitution, distributed upon different vacant lands, and cared for until they became self-sustaining.
I gave to his charge South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida temporarily, Colonel Osborne, the Assistant Commissioner for the latter State, met with a serious accident, while en route to his post, which detained him for a couple of months. Owing to sickness, General Saxton was delayed in extending his organization into the interior. A few officers and agents, however, proceeded as early as June to Augusta and another went in Georgia. Lately, South Carolina and Georgia have been completely organized. From South Carolina reports from the interior of the State are replete with instances of violence and defrauding of the freedmen - murders, whipping, tying up by the thumbs, extorting of wages, over-working, combining for purposes of extortion. &c. From my own observation, I do not infer that such crimes and cruelties give a true picture of the State of society. Yet the criminal list is altogether too great to pass unnoticed. Already the antagonism between whites and blacks in this State is marked, and for the sake of peace and good order it would be unwise to attempt to withdraw the military force. The number of dependents drawing rations in South Carolina and Georgia, at the end of September, was 10,663; the number of schools, 114; number of teachers, 174; of scholars, 9,500.

A very large number of contracts were made for last year, say 6,000. A very noble man, by the name of Barton, – Agent of the Freedmen’s Bureau of General Sherman’s march have been obliged to struggle against many difficulties. He is a clergyman, a man of earnest convictions, and a useful citizen. With him is associated Mr. Blair, who is active, zealous, and useful. The colored people seem to regard these agents with great respect and confidence.

SOUTH CAROLINA.
The colored people are generally industrious. They are easily imposed upon, and are too confiding. They are suffering from exposure and want of proper food and clothing. The planters are mostly unwilling to pay fair wages. Many are compelled to grasp at any terms offered to them.
There is a general disposition among them to work, but they are not well informed as to their rights, and are easily led astray. 

The destitution of the colored people is very great. The planters are generally ruined. The crops, almost everywhere, have been a failure. 

I append a list of teachers sent in by the United States Government to South Carolina, their names, and the schools in which they are engaged.
