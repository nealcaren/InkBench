CIRCULAR, Washington, D. C. May 22nd, 1865.

No. 3.
Whereas a large amount of land in the State of Virginia, and in other States that have been in insurrection, has been abandoned by disloyal owners and is now being cultivated by Freedmen; and whereas the Freedmen are attempting to obtain possession of them, and thus deprive the Freedmen of the fruits of their industry: It is ordered that all abandoned lands in said States now under cultivation growing shall be retained in their possession until the crops now growing will secure for their labor and its products, and for expenditures.

The above order will not be so construed as to relieve disloyal persons from the consequences of their disloyalty; and the application for the restoration of their lands, by this class of persons, will in no case be entertained by any military authority.

O. O. HOWARD, Major General, 
Commissioner Bureau of Freedmen, Refugees, and Abandoned Lands.
