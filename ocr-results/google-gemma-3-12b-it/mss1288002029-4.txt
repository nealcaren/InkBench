"The Governor sees reason," said Mrs.
Bryant, "and I am glad. In view of the distress
ing reports which come very frequently we are
simply compelled to act. "

"Don't you think the Governor is in his line
of duty when he uses his office?" prodded the
young man.

"How might one advise?" replied his mother.
"He seems to be taking the right course.
However, this is one of those things not to concede to
others. It is a question that is hard to settle,
and the Governor and you are both right.
Always be good. There are so many who
are not willing to be good. It is always pleasant 
to believe that good must be stronger.
There is something that is so comforting and pleasing 
to think these things over.”

"I certainly do not mean to say that the Gov-
ernor is not doing the best he can.
I recognize the awful weight of some of these
matters, and a man feels the responsibility.
To be perfectly frank, the difficulties which
are met are hard and one would often like
to run out and try a new thing.”

"Young man," Mrs. Bryant laid her hand upon
his arm, "have you ever taken the time to give
thought to what you are doing? There is a great
deal to learn more about man. Some of us 
think it's hard for us to speak of. Our
reason for following it is to find if we
can make it all right, and do it without too much
difficulty. The mind that goes at it in a
general way never learns anything. The mind
that studies the way to work, and does it well
will get it done.”

"But would you suggest that we do nothing,
and be content to let it carry on, and trust
to Providence? Surely it is our duty to assist
our fellow creatures, when they are in trou-
ble. Of course, one is likely to look after
one’s own, but I don’t think we are bound to do as if there isn't time or
thought to be given.

Now, can you carry on or is it assumed
that you can stop your efforts? I am thinking
you’ll be able to make your way in this
world; and I am looking for you to be a
very big man at that. Your heart is good,
you have done well, so many have said so;
and that is a mighty fine thing. You should
not let that be shaken, even in the face of
trouble.”

“It is always necessary that the public be
educated, not only upon the evils of the
wrongdoing which is prevalent, but also
the best means to secure correction. There is 
no doubt that it is necessary to secure a
remedy for every wrong doing that reaches the
mind of the people.

Now, when you know your duty,
you are well. When you know it has been
well done, you can go home at night without
a care.”



A little extra help is needed in the kitchen
Mrs. Bryant turned to her son. “For the present
it is not what I want.”
