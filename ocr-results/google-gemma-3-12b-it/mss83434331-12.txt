"(c) PREAMBLE.
WHEREAS, unconditional slavery exists to a fearful extent amongst us as a nation, in violation of those principles that molded us as a nation, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;"
WHEREAS, the aristocracy of the South are determined to perpetuate it by means scarcely less dreadful than the tortures of the Inquisition, and the [bastardly] aristocracy of the North are aiding them “chivalrous” endeavors by misrepresenting, discrediting, and suppressing that portion of the people, the cause of universal freedom, and further, by circulating publications and making speeches so bigly dangerous and improper, that an appeal to them and their ruthless work of terror and destruction would they will establish the shameful and cowardly precedent of surrendering their most sacred rights to the demands of an oligarchical, domineering, and self constituted aristocracy, or in the spirit of their fathers manually maintain them.
AND WHEREAS, if we remain silent and inactive, we effectually surrender our rights and with them the hopes of the free all the land of his liberation shall be realized, the slave fearless and alive shall till the prediction of Jefferson entitled “the blood of the master.”
THEREFORE, Resolved, under a deep sense of duty to ourselves, to the slave, to our country, & to God, that we sink or swim, live or die, serve or perish, - we will adhere to the rightful discussing the subject of slavery, that we will used constitutional and peaceful means for its speedy termination—and to the more efficiently, form ourselves into an arrangement and adopt the following, &c.

(d) RESOLUTIONS.
Some forty miles from Cincinnati, are two settlements of free negroes—probably near a thousand—men, women and children, of the true ebony color, & with a very little mixture of the mahogany or lighter shades. The negroes own their own accustomed property, built their own dwellings, and raise their own flocks, herds, and families.   They are industrious, & are generally employed in mechanical arts, in farming & otherwise.  In these lands were purchased expressly for them, and parceled out among them about fifteen years ago. Theirs are not of the beautiful of this land; but, by good management could they be induced to cultivate the soil that God has given them.

It is said, as we have heard, that "the negro is by nature so lazy, that he will work under no other compulsion than that which is exerted by the lash." If this were true, why is it that such countless numbers of white people are employed under the patronage of a master, & a white society, or some portion of it.

The resolution adopted by the Philadelphia meeting, is not for us, but it is a good foundation upon which to build: the immediate abolition society are too extreme and hot, & the gradual emancipation friends are too cold: we want a moderate course; one that is practical.
We call every man of sentiment to meet us, that we may come to some practical action—that we may be enabled to strike a blow against the system.—There is no time to lose. 



We, the subscribers, as citizens of Indiana and Ohio, & true believers in the republican sentiment, do hereby constitution ourselves into an association to be known by the name of the "Central Indiana and Ohio Anti-Slavery Society.” Article 1. Our object shall be to promote the abolition of slavery in the United States, and, as far as practicable, to relieve the sufferings of those already enslaved.”
