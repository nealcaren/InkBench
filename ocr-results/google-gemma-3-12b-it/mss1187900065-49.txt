**THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE ON THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.**

The President’s message to Congress on the Pacific Railroad question is a document of considerable length and importance. It reviews the history of the construction of the road, the difficulties encountered, and the various measures that have been taken to secure its maintenance and improvement. The President expresses his deep concern over the present condition of the road, and the serious consequences that would result from its abandonment. He urges Congress to take immediate action to provide for its continued operation and to secure its financial stability.

The message sets forth in detail the financial difficulties of the Pacific Railroad companies, and the various efforts that have been made to relieve them. It points out that the companies have expended vast sums of money in the construction and maintenance of the road, and that they have been subjected to severe competition from other transportation lines. The President believes that the Government has a special responsibility to assist the companies in maintaining this important national asset.

He recommends that Congress authorize the appointment of a commission to investigate the condition of the Pacific Railroads, and to make recommendations for their future management and financing. He also suggests that the Government should guarantee a certain rate of return on the investment of the companies, and that it should provide for the construction of branch lines and other improvements to the road.

The President’s message is a comprehensive and well-reasoned statement of the Pacific Railroad problem. It is certain to provoke a lively debate in Congress, and it will be of great interest to the people of the country.
