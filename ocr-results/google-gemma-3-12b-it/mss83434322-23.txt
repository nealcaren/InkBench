RECONSTRUCTION: 

A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE L. STEARNS.

ELMER, Salen Co., N. J.
Feb. 27, 1865.

GEORGE L. STEARNS, Esq., Boston, Mass.
Dear Sir - I lately received from two gentlemen in Missouri a call which I thought might be proper, and ask you advance and contribution for the purpose of doing in that State all the good we reasonably can with a portion of the money and the means of water, and the land. The right to these elements is inalienable; and since the white race knows it, they must admit of it’s proper use and enjoyment.

"A corrupt use of the ballot box is not Democracy, but an aristocracy of the franchise.” The franchise should be guarded by the severest penalties. Even to formerly enslaved men, as characteristic of the offender, with imprisonment at hard labor, and disfranchisement for the full offense; and a total for the second, would probably accomplish that end.

“Sincerity motivates—withdrawal—all similar themes to a corrupt vote. Make the story of converts plain. Do the work of the sensible expression of the honest and unreported depreciation of existing things — outlining more differences of thought. Mind rules the universe. Give it an open field for happy and useful progress. I am for the intended uses, and after the abolition process, with improved mechanics and guided by the national institutions.”

“The right to suffrage is a common right—a common good created by the American constitution—and it is to be protected in the enjoyment of all, which no living thing, be it man, woman, or child, can resist.” — Maintain, be ever vigilant, & the result, — this affair — is as sure as the dawn.

Johnson’s ideas, they say, are that "freedom is too good for the negro:" and he is to be controlled by the white race; that if he is to be made a citizen, four years of labor shall be exacted from him as they did from him before. I decline to accept this definition of freedom.

“JUDGE STERN, of Memphis, says: ‘The question is not whether suffrage shall be confined to intelligent men, but whether unintelligent white men shall vote.’ “

“How much blood has been spilled, how much property destroyed, how much has been spent to include freemen in our government. Let us exercise in the enlargement of liberty.
- I venture to state that they who have stirred up civil war have an affinity for that which would exclude the colored people, and they who are for peace and restoring ‘the Union’ are for extending the franchise. “

I am with you in the belief that sincere faith in God and in the people, they are based on construction anew, and on such virtues as moisture or such as virtue—are not only capable of replenishing the root, but the entire treasury of human hope. Herewith I send you $30 I believe will be fully appropriated.

I am, truly yours,
WM. HEIGHTON.

P.S. - He says they may surrender the war, or they may recapture it—they may franchise or they may disfranchise—but they will not do both: The attempt to do so will renew war itself.



In a conference held by Secretary Stanton and General Sherman with the colored people of Savannah, on some offer that was taken, said: "First—supress city, schools and orgauizations!
Second—break up education of the urchins!
Third—Let the better of the planted land
“All the land may be inherited .’

“Let them turn and till it: we suspect not
at all love land, but turn it all over
the colored man:- he is the only man
to really turn it over, and let him
do so:

“Will they be able to till?
Have they the capacity of tilling land under
any consideration such as the white man
is guilty of? – I say, yes. . . .

He hopes to be reunited upon the occasion of an election. Bring in and rectify the black man.
The common sense of the county
must be roused to this one great duty
— of suffrage—that commensurate with an
honest and useful life and future constructive period, in a condition like this. Faugh—

Died instantly Sunday afternoon, of apoplexy, Col. S. B. Bellman of this county.
