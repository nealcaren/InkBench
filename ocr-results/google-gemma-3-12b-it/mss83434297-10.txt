Mr. Speaker, the discussion has, in return, was the exercise of such powers necessary before?. Sir, there was little occasion for their enactment during our earlier wars. When a few influen-
ced gentlemen have talked on this floor, the executive councils sent them far inland into the then remote State of Virginia.
They were there seized, by night or by day, wherever they could be found, and forthwith hastened upon their journey, and decked the right to the writ of habeas corpus expressly denied them.
That transaction was approved by George Washington, and the Continental Congress passed a bill of indemnity, covering all parties concerned in it. There were its true-cow boys in those days in the South, and as this instance shows, a few false and coven hunters in the North who sympathized with the enemy and prayed "for no more, any terms," but they were so few that they dared not speak to hope to effect the sentiment of the loyal men of the opposition, to is now hoped by the disloyal managers of the opposition, to be able to paral-
yze the arm of the Government.
During the late war; the men who attempted to embarrass the Administration charged with its conduct were overwhelmed



hands of loyal men in the rebel States, and by immediately yielding a united and enthusiastic support to the Government, thus speedily and thoroughly crushing the hopes and effect-
ually baffling the efforts of the rebels.
