PROSPECTUS.

THE American nation, embracing in its origin the elements of civilization found in all other countries, has, as a portion of its manifest destiny, the taking to itself of the Good and Beautiful, whether it cannot be inherited. Civilization progresses westward, yet the scientific improvements of other races, or as others avail themselves of ours, so should there be a mutual enjoyment of the advantages to be derived from the intellectual labours of those great minds which have conferred glory on their native countries and on the world.  Labours for the whole world, invariably cosmopolitan, to thinks and every true writer is invariably a co-part of the thinker and the world, which has not a claim to enjoy and profit by his labours, german Literature is rich in great and genial poets, who deserve to be made known to every one in our own country, who claims to be well educated or informed. Genuine classic literature is the best and most appropriate reading for an intelligent and independent public. - in the old and in a calm pleasure, the middle aged an incentive to earnest thought and action, and the young a guide to that enjoyment of the beautiful, to which their every intellectual and physical sense is so keenly alive. Being convinced that both musical and labour should spare no pains, either in the literary or publisher preparation of sound classic works, and having been still further induced, by the representations of those engaged in instructing, the necessity of such an undertaking, we have determined to give to the great names of German Literature a home on American soil. Since the beauty-thick, of March of this year, *Poor Heinrich.*  HENRY HEINE in the original text, and in weekly numbers. With this number begins the publication of what we believe to be a translation of *Travels by the Rhine,* of the *Reisebilder, or Pictures of Travel* by HEINLE, merit, the talented translator is bound inspire with an unknown to our literary public for one who is himself inspired with a power to comprehend the spirit of a poet, and to render it worthily to a kindred soul.

Heine, as already known to the discerning, is a poet, a minstrel and a philosopher; for the beautiful, the witty, and the thinks which have adorned his writings.

The *Reisebilder* is a work which, by its vivid descriptions, its amusing anecdotes, and its sparkling wit, has captivated the public of Europe and is now introduced to the American reader.

The following works of the same author, in the same exquisite style, will also appear in our weekly “Prospectus”:
*Book of Songs*.
*German Romance*.
*The Loreley*.
*Belshazzar's Feast*.
*Poland*.

We also determine to afford an easy and popular introduction the great masters whose beauty and whose greatness claim that the study of the language should be sought after.
