My dear Harry:-
I feel perfectly ashamed for not having written to you before these weeks. I've stayed with our dearly beloved Chief. However, I intended to be so much to do the last day and I did not have to send you a hurried note but a real letter full of details which no one else could dispatch. Mrs. Catt reads me parts of your letters and it's both much interested in your lovely trip and so glad you are having such a grand time. You certainly can give the ladies glimpses of things and we much enjoy the amusing spirit and dry – Well to begin with Very Prominent! Mother Catt and I certainly not arrive the day to land. Then I came on a lovely afternoon. Dec. 8th and the dear lady was waiting for us on the platform – New Rochelle. I can imagine that the first two days there you very very much to take about and to me and it seemed to relieve her greatly although there were many tears, still fell she liked to tell
