Carrie Chapman Catt
510 PARK AVENUE
NEW YORK

July 14th 1944.

My Dear Mrs. Park:

After 3 weeks at home, with a nurse in charge, Mrs. Catt is trying to get back to normal living.

Dictating some letters, but I could see that she had done enough. So I told her that I would write to all the old friends and tell them that she was very much improved in health, and that she would love to have a letter from them. 

She is now able to see people and although we limit the number per day is enjoying seeing her friends once more.  
Mrs. Slade and Mrs. Abel Russell are to come in Tuesday afternoon, they say they are very much interested in the news of the European progress of the warring closed.  We are seen in the news much these days as the writer or the war game, but still keep our doors open.

Speciles 
To Mrs. Maud Wood Parks, in regard to “When I’m Eighty, they gave me a birthday party in New York and it was arranged that I was to take the only speech. They suddenly they got it, it was with the intention of having it printed, but I did not know that. I was not only interested but they had just two days to get it printed. It was brought into the room when we were having a luncheon before I had finished speaking. Then Mrs. Slade made an announcement about it, and called it a pamphlet, I was the printed pamphlet, which they proceeded to give out to those attending the luncheon. It never has occurred to me to address her correctleans. It was and, only the other day, in going through the shelf that had the remainder copied, I say down and looked it over and found it full of his terrific mistakes anybody could have put in a pamphlet, where the hard part for us, I knew given any lot of them, which was virtually assuming that I thought it was correct. I have never been blushing over since, 
and, now, obviously, make errors like in writing our own history, how can we expect the coming world, not yet born, to ever know the truth about it?
