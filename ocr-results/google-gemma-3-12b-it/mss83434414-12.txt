"VI. Brigadier General R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plantations, and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or desired in the policy now on Beaufort Island, nor any rights to property heretofore acquired be affected thereby."

"By order of Major General W. T. SHERMAN:"
"L. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant General."

In Virginia quite an amount of land was libelled and about to be sold by the marshal just previous to the establishment of the bureau, when the sales were suspended by the Secretary of War, in order that these lands might be turned over to the bureau for the benefit of the freedmen. I claimed that these lands, which had been condemned to sale, though not actually sold, were already the property of the government, and objected to his excellency’s regarding President against the insertion of the word "sold" in the definition of confiscated property. The president referred the matter to the Attorney General, whereupon—

This decision necessitated the restoration of all the property where the sale had been suspended. I have been very desirous of conforming to the letter of the law in settling apart lands, but was unwilling to do before it became probable that they could be confided in. In this way much disappointment and suffering would be avoided.

The freedmen were so eager for the possession of land, and so likely, without that possession in fact or in prospect, to be obliged to leave their present homes, that I made the following proposition through yourself:

BUREAU OF REFUGEES, FREEDMEN, AND ABANDONED LANDS,
Washington, September 4, 1665.

SIR: The matter of imposing some conditions in the cases of pardoning those who have been presented to me by the Attorney General, for the benefit of this class of persons, having been suggested to me by your plan, which I heartily endorsed, I deem it best to suggest a die-suggested to me by your planning proposals, to wit:

1st. That hereafter pardons of the President of the United States, extended to those who have been excepted in his proclamation of May 29, 1865, having more than 20,000 dollars' worth of property, be conditioned by specific stipulation that each individual case: that is to land-owners, citizens of the United States, in addition to the usual oath, shall also take an oath to aid, to the best of his ability, in settling destitute and abandoned freedmen on land, by contributing either of such land or by contributing money to that purpose.

2d. That in case the pardoned party shall fail to comply with this stipulation, that his pardon shall be void.

3d. That any land thus acquired for the benefit of the freedmen, which may fail to prove adapted to cultivation, may be sold, and the proceeds used in settling other freedmen.

I am satisfied that this plan of imposing conditions will be productive of much good, and will materially aid in the settlement of the freedmen upon the soil.

I am, &c.
L. M. DAYTON.
