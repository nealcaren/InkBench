no difficulty in choosing yours, subject to the luncheon later since at 12 o'clock P.M. and the length of time devoted to ad-
dress is about an half-hourly five minutes
almost.
Please let me have a short sketch
in which we may use for publication in
our newspapers relating to yourself
and your public work. We would like
to have this by Thursday a.m. of the coming
week so it can be included in League
notes for next week.
Mr. Harris and I shall be very much
pleased to have you as our guest
while in our city.
