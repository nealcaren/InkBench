**THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.**

The President's message to Congress, read yesterday, is a document of considerable length and of a serious character. It deals with a wide range of subjects, and while it does not contain any startling or sensational announcements, it is full of important recommendations and observations.

**The Tariff Question.**

The tariff question is, as might have been expected, the most prominent feature of the message. The President expresses the opinion that the existing tariff laws are not satisfactory, and that a revision is necessary. He does not, however, enter into a detailed discussion of the subject, but simply states that he is prepared to recommend such changes as will, in his judgment, promote the interests of the country.

**The Currency Question.**

The currency question is also touched upon, but in a more general way. The President expresses his belief that the existing currency system is adequate to the needs of the country, and that no radical changes are necessary. He does, however, suggest that some modifications may be desirable in order to provide a more stable and reliable currency.

**Foreign Affairs.**

The President devotes a considerable portion of his message to foreign affairs. He expresses his satisfaction with the relations between the United States and other nations, and he commends the policy of maintaining a strict neutrality in the disputes of European powers. He also urges Congress to ratify the treaty with China, which has been pending for some time.

**Civil Service Reform.**

The President reiterates his support for civil service reform, and he recommends that Congress pass a law providing for the examination and appointment of Government officials on a merit basis. He believes that such a law would promote efficiency and honesty in the public service.

**Other Matters.**

The message also deals with a number of other matters, including the Indian question, the Pacific railroad, and the national debt. The President recommends that Congress take steps to protect the Indians from further encroachments, that the Pacific railroad be subsidized, and that the national debt be reduced as rapidly as possible.

**General Character of the Message.**

The President's message is characterized by a tone of moderation and conservatism. It is not a partisan document, and it does not attempt to stir up controversy. It is a thoughtful and well-considered statement of the President's views on the important issues of the day.
