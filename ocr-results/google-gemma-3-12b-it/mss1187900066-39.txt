Florence June 14, 1885

My dear Friend,

I have sent
you some portions perhaps of
my book in apportionment.
My bosom not having conclusively
selected itself, I suspect that
I gave you what I should
take most pick & choice
and how action, each
of the whole 65 pages
and will send you an
easiest copy. However, you
selest it, so I shall
back them. From other
corners, I have sent
Chapters. Always send me
more. Toby, of course,
is with me.

Book XIV, and
83 letters all count for
one visit & I become fun
