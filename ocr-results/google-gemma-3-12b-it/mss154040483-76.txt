Election Laws and Methods is a part of the work of the League of Women Voters, but it may at this moment be less appealing to many women than it is to very few men. It is often said there is no other department of the need should be dropped without Women responsible, other organizations would be glad to assume it, as they were before, for example, Women Voters; but if the political departments of women’s functions, in other parties are lessened, that is no reason we ought to have increased in 1920. We were entrenched in 1920, we were earlier at that time and there is no more talk. The reason why we were not entrusted long before some of the people who are now so quick to say it is not our work now and frankly they are interested in getting the work out of this country so that their own organizations in this country can take it over. It is very difficult to get women to do political work unless they are very much interested in it and unless they are being urged to do it. They’re too busy making a home and educating their children and doing hundreds of other things. It is impossible to secure such help unless you are very persistent and unless you make it so attractive that they want to do it.

The question for our consideration is whether the department of Election Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it an election to register the voters — to explain the opinions that will vary much to the women in our community. It always tends to be charged with some sort of partisanship. The political machines have been working to the end that all the people who will vote in this country will be registered, but that does not mean that those who do the registering are in sympathy with the political side of it because it is always the political side that is doing it.

Here is the address made by Mrs. Catt at the Cleveland Convention when, after a long discussion and a suggestion for a committee on Election Laws and Methods was elected in a department of Women Voters, called Efficiency in Government. This speech was felt to be the proper expression of the hope of the people’s wishes that had been repeatedly asked for by our readers.

Reform, therefore, is needed in the elections of the President of the United States and all the way down to the dog-catcher in the smallest village.

Where We Need Reform

Perhaps we need it most in our platform-making. Ours is a country of tremendous power in this land, so tremendous that it demands to be reckoned with of those who want to control it. If we can control it, we can do it, and if women get a hand in it-well, we can do it then!

– By Carrie Chapman Catt

These were two questions only in that campaign and there were many others. It is difficult for women to explain their opinions than there to explain them felt the vote would vary many of them felt the vote would be more of a burden than a blessing. What happened then, happened all the time, because there is a political machine, state and nation and because of political machines there is reform.

gram when necessitie arouse. The campaign of these hobbies against suffrage is known as the “pure system” of what is interested, but many other interests united in its support.

There is also an autocracy of what is known as the pure system to it is curious, in one of the states which had been registered it was found that the state was being, and they would not vote for ratification because that would not vote from this country. We had to do a good deal of work to put the ratification through the country.

We were not prepared the first time we tried to get suffrage through this country and did not know the tactics about the whole political situation. Now, we know all about it and the women of the country know who is the head man and who is the under man. Those of us who have the ability to do so are going to carry on for the women and there is no question but what woman is going to be a partner of man.



The Women Voters, which is a part of the League of Women Voters, is the most efficient outfit that has been in this country to get the women to understand the details of the campaign. It is true that the women are not expected to do the work but they want to know what is going on and there are thousands upon thousands of women who are ready to take it up for any reason.



Now as to where we need reform to-day it is almost as great where we need it now as it was in 1920. It is a question of getting the women to vote in the right way and that has been a question of getting men to vote in the right way.
