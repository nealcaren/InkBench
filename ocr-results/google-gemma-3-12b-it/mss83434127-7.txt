I was dying to prefer my request that he would purchase Psyche and her children, and so prevent any future separation between her and her husband, as I supposed he would not attempt to make a present of Joe, at least to any one who did not wish to be bothered with his wife and children. In the subsequent evening I was again with Mr. O.—alone in the strange, bare, wooden-walled office of his study which is our sitting-room, and revolving in my mind the means of rescuing Psyche from her miserable suspense, a long chain of all my possessions, in the shape of bracelets, necklaces, brooches, earrings, etc., wound in glittering procession through my brain, with many hypothetical calculations of the value of each whole being equal to the price of this poor creature and her children; and then the great power and privilege I had foregone of earning money by my own labor occurred to me, and I suddenly accosted Mr. O.—“My dear sir, the latest hour affords me the privilege for the last four years of my life that preceded my marriage. I literally coined money, and never until this moment, I think, did I reflect on the great means of good, to myself and others, that I so gladly gave up forever for a maintenance by the unpaid labor of slave-people, telling not rarely upon,” but under the bitter condition, "that the bare contemplation of which was trying my heart.” You will not wonder that when, in the midst of such confessions, I eagerly accosted Mr. O.—"I was to this effect: “Mr. O.—I have a particular favor to beg of you. Bringing me now of your intention to permanently sell my children without letting me know of it.” —“Mr. O., do you do, and give me the option, first of all, to supply the means of redeeming them; and, if impossible, to see that, when he has taken it in writing, his eyes are opened to the necessity of unrelenting, irrevocable “no." I detailed to him as much as I could, in reference to the strange pains my body; with mild, and undemonstrative argument, I urged him to postpone the sale, “so as not to sever the ties already formed by affection of her children—sympathy between them—and powerful, growing contents of some character of influence for good, and the possibility of some remark and calamity obedient to me, to be avoided.” And what did this wise, benevolent, and benevolent intelligent man do? He not only replied, “You are very right,” declaring his consent, but repeated the circumstances with a solemnity that made me assume that he elevated himself to the new allegiances and engrafted on his old discourse indications, and promises to do more than any wealthy man I have ever had dealings with so far. If tomorrow he should persist in his course, I would not despair?

by. Think, Sir,—how it fares with slaves on plantations where there is no crazy Englishmen to weep, and entreat, and upbraid for them, and no master willing to listen to such appeals.

CHAPTER II.
THE GOLDEN RULE.

“Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do even so to them;” for this is the law and the prophets.” —MATTHEW 7: 12.

“We consign them (the slaves) to no heathen thrall, but to Christian men, professing the same faith, speaking the same language, reading the golden rule, and no one-sided and distorted shape, but as it is recorded—‘rule to slaves, as well, as on the masters.’ —JUDGE WOODWARD’S SPEECH of December 13th, 1690, pg.10, Democratic Edition.

“It is said by some, however, that the great principle of the Gospel, love to men, necessarily involved the condemnation of slavery. Yet how should it have any such result, when we remember that this was no new principle, but, on the contrary, was laid down by the devout men of our own choice, in the days when the word was held in a different sound, before the most intelligent and distinguished of our own country, and ere this nation burst forth into an unmeasured and unfastidious state of enfranchisement and liberty? The rule was given ere Christians had dominion to mail fellow or otherwise; yet the implicit faith remains.”

“And now, I ask you, before you adjudicate our case—are we not bound to seek the council of the man, of God, rather than summon the rings of the world?” 
“If the goodness of God results from our obedience to His law, then it is the book of all men. The church should be the remnant of our faith.”

“Would you remit these people at such hazard—or render them subject at the instance of abolitionists?”
