July 9, 1933.



Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,
1809 Charles Street,
Boston, Mass.



My dear Miss Blackwell:



I am so sorry to trouble you again about that annuity. The annuity has gone through and yet there remains something to do.



I should tell the Insurance Company to send the checks to me and say they must be endorsed by the actual person receiving the money; therefore, when the people are the beneficiaries of an annuity, both must endorse the check if not otherwise agreed. However, apparently, you would have to send the check to Boston for your endorsement and send back to us for deposit, hence the necessity for getting authority to have all the checks sent to me.



The annuity has gone through and I have the policy. I deposited with the North Eastern Title Insurance Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, $1,500.00 received annuity #1466.
 
The total income from the $1,500.00 is $246.06 per year. It is my intention to divide that amount with you. You will, therefore, receive $73.48 each year for your life. I thought a small payment made on the second, third and first December. For
it will still keep to the same. The third will come on June 19, 1936
and the final check in the year. You will still have $131.16.



I am so glad to come to terms with you. It was so much more agreeable.



Lovingly,



John Hunt and his wife children and then died himself.



They were sons and a daughter-in-law, sisters-in-law or neighbors to sing with him are all finally dead.  the little girl was five years old.  She sang “The Yankee Boy,”

I enclose a paper which they ask both you and me
to sign. You must have a witness, not a notary, so any one
will do.
