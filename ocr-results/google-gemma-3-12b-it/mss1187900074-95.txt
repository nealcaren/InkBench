I should like a written 
note to enlarge upon how 
very much we enjoyed your 
visit down at Union and how 
glad we should be again to
welcome you. Should you
be tempted over more to
close the waste of waters-
Detroit? We are all quite well
but anxious some of our dear
and friend, Victoria and 
death have been present.
Dear Cousin Emma, Mrs.
Clurit, who remembered
your visit to Belfast forty two
years ago, and who last
week welcome you.
