Of course the mortgage tax on New York -
gages has been paid and the same not subject to
any tax. 

Of course mortgages outside the State of New
York would be subject to a very small tax if the execu-
tors had not advantage of Article 15. 

Of course the small amount of dividends were
not taxable certainly to any amount. 

Of course the amount of cash on hand de-
cident's death was negligible comparatively and was
used by the executors for expenses of the estate.

All of this estate could have been relieved
of taxation except for a small and negligible amount. [?]

The executors availed themselves of Article
15 of the Tax Law which had been in existence for four
years prior to the death of decedent and of which a
lawyer would now and of which my lawyer in the exercise
of reasonable care would have advised of with regard
to client, would have exploited the advantages of the
estate to some.

There was no provision in the 1911 law cov-
ering the executors within a stated time to avail
themselves of the tax except within these provisions. 
With this law staring Mr. Ford in the face;
with this law providing under Section 336 that unless
the tax were paid under it, the executors would be
held for the full amount of the tax which in fact 
paid of upwards of 25% and approximately 21% Mr. Ford
in the Fall of 1920 says that many banks and before the 
law involved by the Watson case was even passed, that
He told considered Article 15 of the Tax Law as unconsti-
tutional; and Ford gives his legal reasons why he
thought the law of 1911 was unconstitutional; and it
is on the statute books today in spite of the fact that
income tax law has been passed in 1919. 

Under Article 15 of the Tax law the executors 
could by the payment of one-half per centum on the face
value of all the debts on all the income of the estate 
have escaped the taxation for all time to come if they
had done that they should have had the sense to do. 

485 of the Laws of 1915, which was amended by chapter
30, 1917, only went into effect immediately.
