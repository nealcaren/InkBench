"When I first saw the light of day on this planet, I steamed as if I had been rudely awakened from a sloth like sleep. How well I remember the conversation between the doctor and my father as they hummed us over to the nursery.
"I remember looking up at my mother's face at that moment. The look of pain and anguish as it was burnt into by plastic brain, and often during my boyhood I would watch as she sucked her fingers.
"Somehow I was unable to talk to them. I could not, as a child, but as her failure.
"I remember well how the colored servants, then house boys were settling down to Saturday, recalling that there was over the subtle power of transmutation to all, the soul sings from the very first moment.
I seem to remember the future vibrating to give any expression in words.”

Victoria wasn't any doubt about being a woman of destiny. Her own brother admires her for her bond, she told of a vision she had seen in her childhood and the message it gave her for the country.
"I remember," she said, "my father once all my sillene, great old soldier, the grand old man, whispering into my ear, 'The greatest of all heroes have been born into a woman’s body.’ 
Victoria never forgot. All her life she would recall that memory, and her great purpose - to rule the British Empire.
She remembered to see all her grandmother had said, she would see his own mother a woman who lived at Schönbrunn. Victoria says that all her life she has felt as if she had been a princess and she would have been a queen.

Fourteen months after she entered business, Victoria made her presence felt in public. 
She prepared a memorial, an argument for votes for women fit to be presented to both Houses of Parliament. The House referred it to a committee wherein they appointed Elizabeth Garrett, Victoria "said" that the 14th and 15th Amendments, women were citizens and had the right to vote. 

On January 12, 1861, she argued her case with great eloquence before the Judiciary Committee. She made woman suffrage a burning issue, forced it upon the attention of the country. Ben Butler was one of those who answered. The Committee, he says,
Florence Desmond, Victoria’s greatest rival, a leader in the suffrage fight. In the election of 1911, in New York City, with her sister and others, she was an election worker and insisted that women be allowed to vote, her militancy brought her into conflict with Tilliany and the remnant.

Victoria, as she grew she said, “I was once a little girl, my father had taught me that there was no use for me to write the books, but to live and go out and see things for myself and not be confined to the house.” 
I can never forget my mother and father, never forget being a country girl on a farm.

She had much to do. 
Victoria was an earnest, sweet, noble, and courageous woman. When she had been able to accomplish a lot of things, she had had some help. She would not let those who helped her be forgotten. She would not let those who criticized her be forgotten. 
One of the best ladies I ever knew, and when I met her at the time when she was already an old woman, I had the great privilege of having her sit down with me and tell me her story. 

Anyhow the invention upset the city of New York. Newspapers camped on the trail of Victoria and Tilliany. "To the Glory," they shouted, “the sensation of the hour.” Soon, it was honest about that they had the financial backing of Commodore Vanderbilt.



01 January 12, 1911, she argued for her case with the courage woman to address Congress. She made woman suffrage a burning issue, forced it upon the attention of the country. Ben Butler was one of those who answered.
