My Dear daughter, - I hope
you are still getting along
alright. We are well, Frank
is still on the job, and
keeping the house to summer
time heat, despite the nice
bright weather we are having.
The family was here part of
the day. They brought more cotton over
to church and waited here while
she was in service.
Daisy was not feeling
well. She had been to the Doctor
& got a shot and she says it
she did not dizzy and sleepy.
I called to-day said she was feeling
that came to-day from High-

much love from us 
to you.
