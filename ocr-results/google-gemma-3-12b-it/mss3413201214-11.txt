Dear Journal Friends

There is to be a suffrage festival here
Nov 17th and 18th and we are of share
your invaluable credit both. – Can you send
us any decorations and a large card
to have some “Newtie” Page – and I
have about 50 subscriptions planked-
in news done anything? This cost and
have little idea how to go about it-
But Dr. Huntington who is pulling of the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of creating a booth for the
suffrage and so Mary said that by
the time the President gets here, Lizzie Hands
Will have it all sorted - in addition to that
we are trying to get that crowd up to help
with the robes, and extras and extensions.

Nov 17th and 18th and we are of share
your invaluable credit both.
