Grandpa was never called “Lloyd.”
He was first Frederick Barley, the slave
changed to Johnson when he ran
away and because the marine
was home he lived in Newport News was named Johnson; Thomas
was had just finished reading
“The Lady of the Lake” admires
one like to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, therefore
would like to call himself
Douglas instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another and hence
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass. 
Here facts - not hearsay.

Later - first word letter from Fred - he
leaves on his “debating tour” today -
and really debates at Howard. He
will stop with oral. We already metten
Fees mje & Marie and Aunt Crawford.
