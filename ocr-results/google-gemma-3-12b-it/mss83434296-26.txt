By the Militia Law the Governor is required to furnish the troops with suitable clothing, and make arrangements with the Government of the Confederate States to receive the commutation money for the clothing furnished. This law was ratified 20th September, marked “A”, of the clothing and camp and garrison equipage manufactured at that establishment and turned over in the fiscal year ending September 30th.

Independent of the articles manufactured here, many purchases had to be made elsewhere to supply the troops. I enclose herewith a statement, marked "B," of the clothing and camp and garrison equipage issued by Major W. W. Pierce, Quarter Master, for the year ending September 30th.

The cost of every article of clothing has increased at such rapid rates within the last few months, that they are now more than double the price they were twelve months ago.
