Elements.



not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should do high enough from hands to allow a holder to be passed under its right side. 
Third, Criticism. Criticize the line written, by asking questions on each particular given as knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The errors lie, of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is curve, it may be curved the wrong way, or too much or too little; if sloped, too much or too little; the turn will be correct, or too broad, or too narrow. Select one or two of the most prevalent faults, discovered by observation and by your own observation, for correction, direct special attention to them, and have one or more lines written that they may be corrected. Then criticize these same points; see how many have succeeded in correcting them; and write one more line. Thus criticize the execution of each line, and direct attention to the correction of fault after fault until the whole is perfected.
GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines in the sides of the oval written upwards.  4. The Connecting Lines are the lines formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into another at the middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 4. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are six Principles in the small letters; in order in which they occur in the principles. There are six Principles in the large letters; from these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts, all the small letters are made. 6.  The red lines mark the columns, each of which is divided into three oblongs or boxes. Write down the columns all the way. 7. The p.s are a complete compliment of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboards used for teaching invariably for practicing, & the square & round tables are used much more than the two last in the training of the hand.

It is thought a better way to begin the lesson with Small Letters. "It is a very
important matter to fix a definite idea of the forms of simple letters, in the minds of the children,
and a good way is to begin with a few of the most simple, and those which they are to
write frequently." - D. P.  The whole of a letter may at first be given, such as it is written
without any reference to its construction. With this, write several words that shall be
used and repeated frequently.  Let the words be of distinct character, easy to read.
The pupils should be in the habit of repeating the letter or words as they write them,
but not aloud. It is more useful to have them look at the Model, and attempt to
copy it as nearly as possible, than to have them say the letter while writing it. By



an attention to these few things, the pupils will soon be able to write as correctly as they
can read.
I.  The Wrist. The wrist should be steady. It is the foundation of all good writing. 
II. The Fingers. The fingers should be free, not stiff, and not tense.  Too much bending
or pressing the pen will fatigue the hand, and make the writing uneven.
III. Posture. The child should sit erect, & near the desk; the feet placed firmly on the floor;
the elbows in front of him, and in the line of the writing. 
IV.  Position of the Paper.  The paper should be 
inclined according to the way the children write. It must be inclined at an angle
that allows the pen to pass over the surface of the paper with ease. 
V.  Use of Pen. The pen should be held lightly, not tightly; so as to allow freedom 
of movement. The writer should not press the pen too hard. The more light he holds it, the
more control he will have.
