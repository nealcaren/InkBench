Dear Dr. Taylor,

A thousand thanks for arranging for an
Sunday trip to Peters.  That is what I desire. - When?
I fully appreciate that you will not
get a carrier to  take to Newark
as much as I  take to  Munich
but I am fully counting on you
and I have a mulberry that I have been able to find here
