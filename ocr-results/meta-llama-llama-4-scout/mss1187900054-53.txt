Dear Sir;
I send you by mail today the advance sheets of an article by Mr. Jay Cooke, which is to be published in the International Review on the 23rd. Thinking it may interest you I take the liberty of sending you this copy, but not, if you please, to be made public before that date.

Your Truly
Marshall Jewell
