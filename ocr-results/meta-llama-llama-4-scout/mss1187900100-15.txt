Bailey, Seen. Nov. 9th 1891

Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement on foot here to move three thousand families out West. We are trying to make every effort to get up the money. In the name of love we call upon you to assist and we trust sincerely friends to assist. This note comes directly from the cabins of the poor oppressed down trodden and outcast Southern negroes of the northern people refuse to help us we are dead men without a hope. All we want is to get away from our oppressors  & than we can Educate our children. We have earnest & several letters to some friends to ask them to do the same in behalf of poor suffering humanity.

For reference of writer address Hon. L.B. Eaton Memphis Tenn.

Truly yours G.H. McCoomb Sec.
