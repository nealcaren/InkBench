London Sunday May 6, 94.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

Your letter directed to Manchest[er] has followed me around till it reached me here. I am in daily glad anxiety. Then I wrote to your Manch[ester] correspondent; I had not seen your letter then. I asked him to offer it to some one who he and others said that while they did not expect "much" (May they say you the same compliment I do, knowing you are incapable of such finesse!) still they would have been better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. M[.] W[.] thought that once the Society had failed so miserably and I was left to brook for myself, I would not hesitate to speak for you. I can not go through the country telling people about this person al qualities and who accompanied by such a crowd of men who bought me out who I am. As the London member of the 16th race, a positive little voucher.
