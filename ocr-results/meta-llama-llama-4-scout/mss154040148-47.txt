My dear Mollie:- 

I gave you this piece for a 
cable and now it's here. I suppose that char progress 
has been made and that you
are in the vicinity of Cadiz awaiting my cable and start.
March 27. It was uninterrupted here and now I see 
all things are different and time has passed 
since your cable has been received, and it was such 
relief to imagine you passing through 
That abscuraging stage when you think you 
never shall be well again and when life has 
lost all its to savor. Just keep up your courage 
and you'll pull through. I am so glad 
you are better. This world must be a 
black and dismal place when you are 
depressed. I expected to meet you here 
because I thought Spain was a good 
place for Cable but it seemed best 
to send him to Madrid. but I secure many American
