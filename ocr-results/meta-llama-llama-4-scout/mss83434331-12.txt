"(c) PREAMBLE.

"Whereas, unconditional slavery exists to a fearful extent amongst us as a nation, in violation of those principles that moved our fathers to the dreadful struggle of the Revolution-"that all men are created equal," that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Whereas, the aristocracy of the South are determined to perpetuate it by means scarcely less dreadful than the tortures of the Inquisition, and the [bastard] aristocracy of the north are aiding their "chivalrous" compeers of the South in their inhuman endeavors by misrepresenting, slandering, threatening, and imprisoning those who boldly espouse the cause of universal freedom, and further by circulating publications and making speeches so highly incendiary as to excite mobs, I impel them to their ruthless work of terror and destruction 

Whereas, the crisis has arrived at which the descendants of the pilgrims must determine whether they will establish the shameful and cowardly precedent of surrendering their most sacred rights at the nod of an arrogant domineering and self constituted aristocracy, or in the spirit of their fathers manfully maintain them.

And Whereas, if we remain silent and inactive we effectually surrender those rights, and with them the hopes of the slave, till the prediction of Jefferson shall be realized, and the slave fearless and free shall till the land of his thralldom enriched with the blood of his master.

Therefore, Resolved, under a deep sense of duty to ourselves, to the slave, to our country, and to God, that "sink or swim, live or die. survive or perish," we will exercise the right of discussing the subject of slavery, that we will use all constitutional and peaceful means for its speedy termination-and to act the more efficiently, form ourselves into a society and adopt the following, &c.

Some forty miles from Cincinnati, to the East, are two settlements of free negroes--probably near a thousand--men, women and children, of the true ebony color; with a very little mixture of the mahogany or lighter shades. The negroes own the land occupied by them, but without the power to sell. Each family has a small farm. They are emancipated slaves, and these lands were purchased expressly for them, and parceled out among them about fifteen years ago.

Their lands are not of the best quality of Ohio lands; but, by good management could be made very good--they are particularly well adapted to grass, either meadow or pasture. Having been formerly slaves and compelled to work, one would suppose they ought to have industrious habits. They have had every inducement to industry and good conduct held out to them.--The experiment was to test the merits of the negro race under the most favorable circumstances for success.

Has this experiment succeeded? No it has not.  In all Ohio, can any white settlement be found equally wretched, equally unproductive?

Farms given to them fifteen years ago, instead of being well improved, and the timber preserved for farming, have been sadly managed--small awkward clearings, and those not in grass, but exhausted and worn out in corn crops--the timber greatly destroyed--wretched log houses, with mud floors; with chimneys of mud and wood--with little timber for further farming.

They are so excessively lazy and stupid, that the people of Georgetown (near by their camps) and the neighboring farmers will not employ them as work hands to any extent. They do not raise produce enough on their own lands to feed their families, much less do they have a surplus for sale abroad. They pass most of their time in their little sorry cabins ; sleeping, fiddling and dancing. One may ride through the "negro camp" as they are called, passing a dozen straggling cabins with smoke issuing out of the ends, in the middle of clearmgs, without seeing a soul either at work or play.  The fear of starvation makes them work the least possible quantity, while they are much too lazy to plant. 

Why do not the zealous Abolitionists go there and see the experiment in all its beauty--the slave changed into a free, but wretched savage!  May not make something of these thousand negroes?  There are not more than two or three families out of the whole who are improved by the change from slavery to freedom.

If Southern wealth can be applied to any productive beneft from the negro settlements are a dead weight upon Brown county, as fit from the negro lands, or from negro labor; and that space of country might as well, to this day, have remained in possession of the Indians.

If any one who wishes to learn the operation of emancipated negroes, visit the Brown county camps. As they sink in laziness, poverty and filth, they increase in numbers--their only produce is their cowries to make them equal to
