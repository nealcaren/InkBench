JOHRNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Liberia, a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1820 by the American Colonization Society (see Colonization Soc.), and established as an independent state in 1847, is between 4° 20' and 7° 20' N. lat., and stretches along the Atlantic from the Sherboro River on the N. W. to the Pedo River on the S. E., a distance of about 600 miles, extending inland from the coast from 10 to 40 miles. Its area, which is steadily increased by purchases from the native tribes, was estimated in 1890 at 11,300 square miles. The shore is elevated and rocky in the S. E., but otherwise low, generally sandy or gravelly, seldom marshy. In the interior the country rises into forest-covered hills and lofty mountain ranges traversed by fine valleys. Many streams flow to the ocean, but none of them is navigable for more than 20 miles from the mouth; the most important are the St. Paul, navigable for 18 miles, and having 7 feet of water at low tide on the bar at its mouth; the St. John, the Junk, and the Cape Mount River. The climate is thoroughly tropical. Of the two seasons, the dry lasts from October to June, and the wet from June to October. In the dry season the average heat is 88°; in the shade; in the wet season 79°; in the shade; the thermometer seldom rising above 90° in the shade; in the wet season never falling below 60°. To the white man the climate is deadly-not from excessive heat, but probably from another elimate, suffers on his arrival here from the co-called African fever. The natives, on the contrary, are robust, healthy, and long-lived. The soil is generally very fertile. The principal farming districts lie along the banks of the St. Paul. Its sugar-cane grows luxuriantly; one year's produce was estimated at 390,000 pounds. Cotton is indigenous, and yields two crops annually. Coffee of excellent quality is cultivated with success in the interior. The cereals, maize, rice, wheat, barley, and oats; the vegetables, cabbage, peas, beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.; and the fruits, oranges, guavas, tamarinds, pomegranates, pineapples, African peaches, etc., are easily raised. The forests contain teak, mahogany, rosewood, hack- shurbs, and several kinds of gum trees, dyewoods, medicinal is the nut-bearing palm, from which palm oil is made. Wild animals, the goat, hippopotamus, crocodile, leopard, etc., are now nearly exterminated. Of minerals, iron, gold, and copper is said to occur in the interior. The inhabitants of the republic numbered, according to the largest estimates, about 1,068,000 of whom about 18,000 are  long to different tribes; the Vassa, Mandingoes, Mahomammedan natives. The rest are Liberians-Liberianized or long to different tribes; the Vassa, Mandingoes, Mahomammedan natives. The rest are Liberians-Liberianized 
among whom the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U.S. has established a mission school at Tocorreh; the Presbyterians and among whom the American Baptist missionaries established a mission in 1835; the Basas, among whom the American Kros, mostly idolaters; the Mandingoes, the most gifted of the tribes under the jurisdiction of the republic; and others. The Americo-Liberians have a regular system of schools, and are progressing in all branches of civilization. Industrial processes and manufactures have been started among them, and a lively trade has sprung up between the republic and the U.S.A., and Belgium and Hamburg. Palm oil, sugar, cotton, coffee, ivory, canwood, arrowroot, etc. are exported; cotton goods, dyed goods, powder and tobacco are imported. The country is divided into four counties-Monrovia, Grand Bassa, Sinou, and Maryland. The capital, Monrovia, is situated on Cape Mesurado, and has about 3000 inhabitants. Other settlements are New Georgia, Caldwell, Virginias, Lexington, Buchanan, Millsburg, etc. The annual revenue is about $100,000, almost exclusively derived from custom-house duties. A public debt of $500,000 was contracted in 1871. The constitution of the republic is modelled after that of the U.S. All citizens and equal. Elections take place by ballot, and every male citizen who possesses real estate has the right of suffrage. But no white man can be admitted to citizenship, and none but citizens can hold real estate in the republic (a temporary provision). The president is elected for two years; the senators for four; the representation for every 10,000 inhabitants. The first president was Joseph Jenkins Roberts, who served four terms, from 1848 to 1856, and was once more elected in 1871. Hilary R. W. Johnson was elected president May, 1883. The official language is the English.
