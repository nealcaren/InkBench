Jean fed us.  Alice alluded the Lrague W. Dodge army and Staff Song among them and along with we  brought a blue cross and received a beaker.

I am hoping the war will end in the Such East and that she in their white pelts will chat with me.  It is home or here almost I am dispirited suicide.

Looking forward
