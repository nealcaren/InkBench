I do not think I ever 
saw a prettier green and blue 
shell. There are a great
many different kinds. 
This letter I have made
you a slip
and sent it. I hope
you will 
like it. I have told you 
that you could not speak
broken English 
but I do not
think you 
can. I have made
a big sheet for you 
and I shall 
put on it all 
the names of 
different shells 
and what they 
look like &c &c
If I had 
only ink 
I should write 
to you 
tonight. 
but 
I 
will 
to 
morning.

Your 
friend Mary 
Wishart 
July 20th '89.
