NewHaven, Aug.15, 1894.

Dear Mrs. Sorylass:

Judy Sheldon has just informed me that Lizzie's
family has received a letter for you, and that you are
in Washington. We fancied that you wanted in Boston with Mr. Sorylass, and so none of us knows how
to address a line either to you or to
NewHaven.

I am quite desirous of hearing
how Mr. Sorylass is and what his
plans are for the rest of the vacan
tion.
 
Can you give us any idea
as to when you and he will come
this way? We are all looking for
