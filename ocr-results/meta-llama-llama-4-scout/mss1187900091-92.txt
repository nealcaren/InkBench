My dear Douglass:

On my passage thro'
New York yesterday from Phil'a where I spoke on Friday evening, I called at Ken-
nedy's Office for news about the sailing of our Steamer.  And this is what the clerks
on the office assured me:

The steamer is the "Oranje Nassau".
She will sail from Pierpont Stores (along
on the west street ferry) Brooklyn,
on Friday next 5th inst at noon for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count our thus
information as entirely reliable.
I have always understood that the
"Oranje Nassau" is the prettiest steamer of the
line.  Will she is staunch and sound and
I guess we can stand it for six days on board
