Dedicated

My Dear Miss Catt:

For six weeks I have been in
the General Hospital, Osteopathic
Unit #750 - at Los Angeles, after
presenting with a fractured leg.
I have been here 6 weeks today.
I hope soon to be released from
this terrible house of torment, a
east, as soon as I can return
to my little apartment at
609 Treenew Ave., San
Pasadena, Calif.

Many friends have been
wonderful to me in so many ways.
My close
friend Mrs. Lois Faucett, 1918
Oak St., So. Pasadena - who has
been kind to me in charge.

Cordially
Henrietta P. Moore R.N.
