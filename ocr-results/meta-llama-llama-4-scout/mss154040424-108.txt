Following the example of all oldsters I want to give one bit of advice, and I want to leave with you one fact which I have learned as the result of my life's experience. I do not expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may remember the fact. The advice is that when you go forth from the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from indigestion; nor is it the idle fantasy of a disconcerted mind, although these charges have both been made!

Each of you young people who have graduated from the University of Wyoming has a special bent, some sort of instinctive and characteristic development that is not at this moment in need of land—much less farms or ranches. A few I would not ask you to be reformers—that means giving your entire life to one cause. All I am asking you is this: wherever you go, take your convictions with you at all times.

There is a law of gravitation that during your life in college evolution—you have learned much if you regard it as being __ near regained __ 
 __ that is, it works while you sleep, but I want to tell you that evolution requires evolvers—men and women of vision who are willing to live and to die for their cause. So I ask each of you, along the line where your 
 instinctive bent is, to think things through, to take 
    Learn to think things through, to take
into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions of those who do not agree with you and where you are today even when they annoy you. Make the large things look large and the little things small. The greatest

You, the sons and daughters of Wyoming, you have the immortal example of your state to follow. Then, fifty-two years ago, the young territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone - alone in all the world. In 1869 I was a young child studying geography, and I remember my map with that great yellow splatch which included Wyoming, and it was called the Great American Desert. The granting of votes to women in some unknown state in that great desert had little influence on the outside world. What good thing could come out of a desert? But time brought influence to Wyoming, and then the world jered at her.

I am sure there must have been men who went as delegates to political conventions and as delegates to Congress—who had been looked upon as machines who had been steady to defend the constitution of the state. To my mind it was a wonderful thing that Wyoming took her stand,  but that was not one iota compared with the 
 that she never failed to stand fast. I do not know in all those years of a single instance when she faltered. The world jeered, and still she stood. I remember long years ago, for an 
 example, when i appeared in the City of Boston.— I mean who was 
 interviewed by the Boston Herald, always an opposer of woman's 
 suffrage. The paper quoted him, "The Honorable Mr. So-
 ure," and so from Cheyenne, Wyoming, declaring woman suffrage a fail-
 ure. The article said that in Wyoming, although the women had 
 the vote, they never used it; that in Wyoming, there were such quar-
 rels in the family because the women voted that there was no peace 
 or harmony; and so 
 on. It appeared in the morning press. Boston was very
