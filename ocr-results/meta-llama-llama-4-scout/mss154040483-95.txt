"Party Clean-ups Are
the Crying Need"

Says

Carrie Chapman Catt

Distinguished Suffrage Leader

WANTED, feminism in politics.  Emily Newell Blair
says so.  Mrs. Blair, a tempered,  broad-visioned and 
one time hopeless,  contestant,  believes  this is the comment  of the other 
party also.  Mrs. Blair says there are two ways only in which women may 
become a power in politics and such power she regards as essential.  One is 
by holding office and the other is by becoming effective in political organization.  Either or both calls for more feminism.

But is the feminism a revival of something we once had or is it a brand-new 
thing we now had or is it a brand-new thing we yearn for? Personally, while I agree 
with Mrs. Blair in many of her comments, I do not think her diagnosis is 
correct.

THE fact is that when the new women voters walked through the 
opened door into American politics there was one great crying need - 
out the nation and that was for a thorough party cleaning.  The parties have 
not been cleaned yet and, apparently, 
are as much in need of it as on the 
day women were enfranchised.

Said Professor McMaster, of the University 
of Pennsylvania, under the title, 
The Political Depravity of the Fathers: 

"A very little study of long forgotten 
politics will suffice to show that in fil- 
bustering and gerrymandering, in stealing 
gubernatorial and legislatures, in 
using force at the polls, in colonizing and 
in distributing patronage to whom patronage 
is due, all the frauds and 
tricks that go to make up the worst form 
of practical politics, the men who 
founded our state and national governments 
were always our equals and 
often our masters."

O the years passed.  Votes were 
bought, nominations were engineered 
into politicians, poor men made 
fortunes in politics, and the price of 
election has flown so high that it must 
withstand continual investigation.

There is a Tamanny Hall in New 
York, a Republican machine in Chicago, 
Boston, and Philadelphia, which is even 
worse.  Neither men nor women have 
seriously attempted to remove the dishonorable use of money, corruption, 
fraud and indecent attempts to cover up 
the wicked things that have been done.

No feminism in politics and no masculinity 
can contribute much to the institution of honesty and 
decency in the administration of party 
politics.  We shall never be a great na- 
tion, our parties and politics will never 
be worthy of the respect of our own 
citizens and their neighbors,  until this 
housecleaning is thoroughly done.  Every 
purchased office, must be recognized 
by all voters as a political crime 
and political honesty must be made the 
common standard of all parties before 
any simple remedy can be applied effectively.

A wide era from women of all parties 
that they will no longer support a party 
that is dishonest, covers graft, or guar- 
antees profit to certain of its men, would 
startle the nation and the world; it 
would awaken respect where it does not 
now exist.  It would put the right kind 
of feminism into politics and take out 
the wrong kind of masculinity.  Instead 
of more women in office and more 
women effectively working in the par- 
ties, the great need is a crusade con- 
ducted by men and women against the 
positive wickedness of their parties.

Suppose Mrs. Blair and her friends, 
a Republican and her friends, conduct a 
Round Table upon these questions:

Are women getting out of politics all 
they should?

Are women giving to politics all that 
they might?

Does politics call for more feminism, 
less masculinity, or more decency?

When the conclusion has been reached 
there will be need of another Round 
Table to answer the next question 

How shall the result wanted be attained?
