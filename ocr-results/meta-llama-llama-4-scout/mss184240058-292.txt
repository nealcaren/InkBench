Dear Aunt, is Rose bringing 
it to the active state, 
I don't think she 
was much pleased 
as I found a book of 
shelfishness as 
 She and Hiram Evles 
did gather fields 
sheep, oxen, & green, 
rolling 

I begin to feel Autumn 
at once & I will make my 
own little map of it.
I know if Aunt Sarah 
were here Huved little claws, at aurora 
I would more than glad to 
offer her services, written 
when my momma's headed, written 
at home. here Hued little claws, at aurora
