And his wretched man with rage 
Did clutch each golden end.
and with my heart I blew them on 
to see my practising feet.

Again, I stood beside the gates 
My heartwas plad and free,
For with me stood a steadfast thing 
The Lord had given me.

Growing old,

The poorer hands in which I have 
Is mable to decay.
But God renew my spirit strength 
Within- the walls of clay.

For me a dimnell though eruft 
round Carth 's fairer light-
But heaven above draws my eyes 
and nearer to my dell.
