Dear Stolberg,

I think the quotation 
at the head of your artist's 
a little bit off color.  There 
is an appeal to mercy 
to them to Buddies 
I think the following from 
the same play is better.

"You take my house when you 
do take the path
That both do lain my house; You
take my life"
When I go to the Neat means
while I live"

You will pardon
The affectation, Matdoyle
