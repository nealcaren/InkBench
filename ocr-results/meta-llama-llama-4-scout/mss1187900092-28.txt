Dear Grandpa:-
I have learned with much surprise that you are still 
in the city of Washington enjoying an extended leave of absence from 
your post of duty. I am very glad that such a leave has been granted 
you, and I know that you are far happier in Cedar Hill than any 
place you can go and that matters could be arranged 
so as to enable you to remain in this
