Wrecks 
and 
Rescues.

by an early member of the board of managers of the A.F.G.S.

revised by the publishing committee.

Life's ocean has its wrecks - o'er which we weep -
Strewn 'long the coast and foundered in the deep;
Its rocks and shoals, the treacherous calm beneath
Its stormy blasts, that spread destruction - death.
It has its rescues too - for Christian bands
Stand on the shores of time, with outstretched hands,
To succor th' imperiled, and to save 
From dangers here, and death beyond the grave.
