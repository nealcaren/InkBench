Dear Frederick Douglass,

When we first saw Jen

many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about Jen
I began to clip and stick them with
the clippings I send you all in
to you- I sent "lots" of them. but alas!
Alas! I have here piles of clippings

It was pleasant to see the
appreciation which you
