Dear Songgles:

Here I am, away up in the Northwest, on my first visit to my youngest daughter, Adelle, the wife of R. B. Scott, who happens to be absent, just now, in discharge of his official duties, at "Soo-yooos Lake," in the "Okanagan Country," as they call it here. For a year and a half, until two weeks ago, it was almost a perfect blank in my life's journey. To be blind, is a terrible calamity to any human being.  Since the surgical operation, two months ago, which extracted the Cataract from my left eye, and then waiting for the torpness and sensitiveness, to light, to subside, two weeks ago I got my new spectacles with a special glass for my left eye, and now, with the aid of that glass, I can see almost as well as ever.  So much for Cocaine and for Science. Thanks to Providence, has man discovery and skill for my holding out so long.  Nature has dealt kindly with you and me.  We may yet become 1776
