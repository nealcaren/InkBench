Washington, D.C.
January 19, 1917.

My dear Mr. Tumulty:

The Legislature of North Carolina has passed a bill granting to the women of that State the same suffrage privileges they have in Illinois; that is, the right to vote for presidential electors and for municipal officers. The Governor has not yet signed the bill but he is pledged to do so and will not fail to sign it, the suffragists wire me.

Mrs. Helen Gardener and I think that this would be an appropriate time for a letter from the President.  This same bill is pending in several other legislatures, including Tennessee, Indiana, New Hampshire, Nebraska, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota and Rhode Island.  The Tennessee suffragists appealed to us to secure, if possible some Democratic influence with their legislatures.

A letter of congratulation from the President and an expression of approval of this form of legislation, together with an expression of his continued interest in the suffrage movement and hope for its ultimate establishment, would be of great assistance to the cause in general and serve the purpose of which we spoke.

Yours truly,
(signed) Carrie Chapman Catt

President

Honl Joseph P. Tumulty,
Secretary to the President,
The White House.
