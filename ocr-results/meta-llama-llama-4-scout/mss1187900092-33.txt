I am quite anxious to see both.  That is one of the greatest difficulty about this place I am unable to keep up with current events unless the paper comes from home, and I miss reading the daily paper very much.

Hoping that I have not put your eyes to a very severe test and that you will favor me with an early reply, I close, with much love

I am,
Your aff. grand-daughter,
Bathie.
