RUTH MCCORMICK, DENEEN SOUND CAMPAIGN CRIES 

Senator Attacks County Administration.

By PARKE BROWN.

She's in Senate Race

Both United States Senator and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, who has announced her candidacy for the Republicans, have undertaken what yesterday was declared as a crusade to see the actual campaign start. It appears that in making these race remarks, she will have been forced by 105 of her fellow senators—Chicago ward committeemen, county town precinct committeemen and township committeemen. Senator Deneen addressed more than an audience and luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It was there he made public part of his speech, a criticism of the condition of public life.

Mrs. McCormick, just before leaving, barely had time to record her determination, every time she will issue a statement charging that a "propaganda factory" is circulating false and misleading stories in her 
campaign. Those stories have been spread over the state with such persistent energy that they have come perilously close to providing her a bonafide candidate status. She said that she not only does not ask for the race, but also she expects to win the nomination.

Deneen Races County Council Rule

The Democratic banquet of 1933, read at the breakfast of Senator Deneen's campaign, revealed in some measure of  public criticisms of malfeasance, or malversation, or misfeasance by certain public officials.

The people have been deceived, hoodwinked, and in part have permitted unworthy motives to influence their law and order and economical and efficient government in our local political life.

The economic laws have moved slowly but mightily against the consent of public officials whose 
character and the lethargy 

Penalty of Bankruptcy.

"The bankruptcy of our public life, which has been approved or tolerated by our people in so many different departments of government. The economic laws are as remorseless as the natural laws and they soon pay the penalty of what we have failed to govern.

We are to pay for it in high taxes; we are to conduct the government day by day; impairing police and fire protection in the city; in the public health, the poor and the sick must suffer, and the youth of the city must be degraded.

FUNDAMENTALLY BUSINESS IS GOOD

J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year), Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), and to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The beans go big with Cornelius—Barbara says the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy hard for the soup and a big cut of spicy mince pie.

You are building a better Chicago—building better Chicagoans.
