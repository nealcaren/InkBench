Friday Mar 8

My dear friend.

I
heard from Iltenea
because I feared I 
understood you were to be there at just that time 
but I could not have met you. I was with 
For Mrs Mo  L. Inglis
 & I was very 
much disappointed I 
could not meet your Mother 
 tho I expected yourself to be 
there. I do take all care 
of myself from this 
What I had one long dinner
