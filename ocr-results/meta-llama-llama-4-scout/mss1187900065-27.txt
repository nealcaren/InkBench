THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
FOR THE
PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS

Headquarters, Fourth Avenue cor. 22nd Street.

New York January 26 1883

To - The Probate Judge of Ocean County N.J.

I inclose herewith the Last will and Testament of Miss Ottilia ashing, who died, as I am informed in the City of Paris, France August 29th1884. I have decided not to open the same for probate, because I do not propose to qualify as Executor; but, in view of the fact of other persons having interests in the estate under the will in question, I deem it my duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to any entertaining an application for administration on the estate, with the will annexed.

Please to note, however, that it is the intention of the testatrix mentioned in the will, on the decease of the trustee mentioned to claim the property to which it is entitled.

Have the honor to remain,
with perfect respect

Henry Bergh

President.
