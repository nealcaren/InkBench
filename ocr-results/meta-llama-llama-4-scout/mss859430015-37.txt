My dear daughter.

Miss Mack came yesterday and brought the box and visited with me awhile.  She said she had a nice trip up and was working at home and clearing away weeds in the back and the like.

We were very glad to talk with you Sunday night. I feel Parks, Jean are doing very well at present.  Brother I and family are quite well now.  He is still bent at Jackson, and they are getting welfare help. I hope you won't over work before you come home.  I suppose some of the children will be over to stay now that school is out. I know you comes home.

Much love from mother.
