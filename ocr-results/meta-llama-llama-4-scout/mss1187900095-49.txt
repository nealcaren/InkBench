Pursue, and I trust I shall
have your approval as wee is,
that of friend Bassett.

Mr. Blaine has been sick in
New York for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get worse.
There is much more manifest in
his condition.

I thank you for long and say
that I fear will be enough to pay to you
now all that I had it in mind
to pay when I began it. But we
have worked not even when we are
very young men ambitious to run
a long once.

With any sincere regards,
your truly,
J.M. Thwing
