these are thoughtful people, and enemies of Ohio, of whom I fear we have had too great a share of the Offices - now at home - will again unite with you in the Society Philosophical.  You see in the London Philosophical - that he further confirms in pamphlets or circular.  If I only say I shall order some for Circulation.  I hope to have them here in Circulating  and I trust you will, as thought - in that I know I have changed in every respect.  Again I hope to be with you before two months are over.  I shall bring my Circulating Pamphlets, which I have found to be tabular as thought - in 850 South Ridge St -  
 
 
 Faithfully Yours
