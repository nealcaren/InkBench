I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not send my check to the Cambridge
Branch of the National League. 
I am enclosing a check for $50, if 
I have already paid will you 
destroy this check.  My old check book 
got destroyed. 

Very cordially
Sara DePONT

Well probably welcome by the 
middle of July and aside from 
some rain, to learn the amount of the 
friend.

(I have already)  I hope Brach has been getting 
some rain, enough to keep all our 
deluged as we have been,
