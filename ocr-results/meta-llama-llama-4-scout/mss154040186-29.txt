My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to congratulate the world upon having you in it all these eighty years to inspire and lead humanity to do its best to advance freedom and civilization.

You have been a recognized thinker and leader in many fields where men and women are proud to follow.  My only regret is that the United States has not yet had the courage to elect a woman to the office of president.  You have been my candidate for that place for many years.  How proudly we should all have campaigned for you!

It is impossible to express adequately our appreciation of all you have done for men and women of the whole world.

It has been a great privilege and joy to work in the ranks with you so wisely at the head.

We all in this household wish you a very happy birthday with deep gratitude and congratulations.

Affectionately,
L.A. Johnson

[seal of the National American Woman Suffrage Association]

February 18th, 1938.

My dear Mrs. Johnson, A special-delivery letter, from Mrs. Stanton, requests that I write you the answer to see questions that she has asked you that you will receive this letter before your meeting, on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place, at present, in which to place its collection when it gets it and must raise many with which to provide a place and for maintenance.  Because it could not guarantee these things to my own library and that of the National Suffrage Association I have arranged to place them in the Congressional Library and that this collection will be kept intact for twenty-five years. Very many books, of small importance to provide by that time owing to the quality of the paper and ink, but there will remain a considerable library which furnishes the source of information for the Suffrage-movement.

The Congressional Library has accepted this library and is ready for it as soon as I can send it to them. They are just completing their building and are not cramped for space. I have told the Women Archives Committee that my collection will go to Washington.

The Congressional Library is only interested in books, but at the Smithsonian we already have three very interesting and good-looking cases representing the National American Women Suffrage Association.

I have written Alice Stone there and that it is very important that she should be included. The Smithsonian is only interested in objects, not in books, and I have some mementos which I will add to these already there. In addition to these I have quite a personal collection of photographs of the leaders and of suffrage activities which we are mounting in photograph-books with explanatory titles. We call this the history of the suffrage-movement in pictures. I do not know what we shall do with these books. They are not complete. I thought of giving them to the National League of Women Voters, but they have much smaller quarters now and if the Archives survive I shall be willing that them to the National quarters new and if the Archives survive I shall be willing that these books of photographs go there.

Mrs. Will Irwin, who writes a book a year, was paid for writing a history of the Woman's Party and also the whole history of the Suffrage-movement. Both were so highly inaccurate that I tremble at the prospect of anything historical that she may do. I do not think that they mean to make the Archives a representative part of the Militant Suffrage Movement.  I am much more inclined to think that it will tell a biased story of the Peace Movement.

I am not opposed to the Archives and have given a small sum of money to it , but I have very little confidence in them. This letter is confidential and comes at the request of Mrs. Stanton.

Hastily,
Carrie G. Catt
