Infty,” written by Andrew Fern to mother: “We are now seizing this fort which is the main entrance to MOBILE. We first invested the fort the 27th last month, and have been here ever since.  We have not lost many yet, 1 killed and 19 wounded.  “All of this regt. There is another fort 6 miles above here called FORT BLAKELY; that is invested by steel, with 15,000 negro troops.  therefore they came out last nite and made three charges on our regiment but to no avail.  They are now digging to under mine their works.  We are trying to cut off their communication with MOBILE.” Much more excellent content, talks about how they are entrenching, to avoid the Reb shells, also putting up breastworks, they are planting some big 100 lb. parrot guns; the Rebs have laid torpedoes very thick in the channel who have sunk 2 of their gunboats, the Rebs have also sunk one of who [sic] have walked over the shell (the forfeiture of the Land mine) “Written in a very neat, nice content concerning BLACK TROOPS and the TORPEDO”
