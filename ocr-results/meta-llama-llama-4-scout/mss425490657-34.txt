Dear Madam:

Before you decide to repaper and redecorate your home -
why not let us show you how you may save money by cleaning
the old surfaces, making them look like new, for a fraction
of the cost of new work?

Whether it be PAINT, WALL PAPER, CALCIMINE or TAPESTRY -
you'll be surprised how quickly and satisfactorily all traces
of "soft coal smoke," dust and dirt can be removed by our
special process.

We will gladly DEMONSTRATE our process without charge, in
your own home - and furnish you with an estimate as to the cost
of our work for one or more rooms.

In addition to our Interior Cleaning, we do INTERIOR
DECORATING, EXTERIOR PAINTING, PAPERHANGING, FURNITURE and
FLOOR REFINISHING. Only the best of materials is used - only
competent (white) workmen are employed - and our prices are
quite reasonable.  All work guaranteed.

We have renovated many of the most exclusive homes and
best office buildings in Washington and Baltimore, such as:

PATTERSON MANSION
Temporary White House

She showed me the photos of each of the children excepting the baby, and they were all good looks from their charming mother.

"Will you be here next Wednesday?" the Countess inquired. "I shall lea early Tedensday morning, as I sail from Liverpool for home Wednesday afternoon."

I expressed the hope that I would.  "If you ever come again," said the Countess, "write me a short while before you sail and we shall plan some delightful excursions together while before you sail.

Mr. Coleridge-Taylor's cultured and  amiable English wife had a voice which was sonorous, rich and sweet.  As her gifted husband accompanied her, while she sang one of his dainty lyrics with so much feeling and art I thought it would be a long time before I should behold a more beautiful
