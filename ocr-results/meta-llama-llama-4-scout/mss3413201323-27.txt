THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE

Some Iowa newspapers carry the special
crusade impression that the special

Building.

The Register recently asked of its readers: "Are 
they satisfied with the situation and give
this country army and navy at 
the start?" 

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.

Mr. Irish rejects a suggestion 
when the legislature had provided a failure in 
Colo-
rado. 
"Does this 
mean that women want equal suffrage? 
Submit 
then, if circumstances should 
at any time oblige the government 
to form an army of any magnitude, 
that army can never be formidable to 
the liberties of the people, where there 
is a large body of citizens, little if 
at all inferior to them in discipline 
and the use of arms."

The constitution was accepted on 
this presentation by Hamilton, but 
he wished 
to move forward. 
The 
delays came 
by J.H. 
Maling and 
himself It 
is 
in 
the 
first 
line 
that he 
endorses 
himself 
as 
"An 
American 
citizen."
Evidently he used 
this 
expression 
to 
conceal 
his 
German 
ancestry. 
What 
would 
we 
think 
What

signed

Third 
in 
the 
column 
is 
a

entitled

Its 
author 
declares 
himself 
"historically 
Hibernian 
and 
neurotic," 
and 
he 
signs 
himself 
"Anglicus."
His 
hyphen 
is 
evidently 
severely 
flamed.

Immediately 
following 
is 
the 
crit- 
ical 
and 
indifferent 
judgment 
of 
Mr. 
James 
Walsh 
from 
Iowa,

says:

The

recently 
asked 
of 
its

"Are

with

Mr. 
Irish 
rejected 
a 
suggestion 
when 
the 
legislature 
had 
provided 
a 
failure 
in 
Colorado 
which 
he 
said 
was 
by 
J. 
E. 
Maling; 
and

had 
provided 
a 
failure 
In

the 
fight

but 
he 
had 
declared 
himself 
a 
"blond 
congressman."

THE 
WOMEN 
IN

Washington 
House 
of 
The 
Des

in 
an 
interview 
with 
Senator 
John 
P. 
Irish 
of 
Colorado 
"Mr. 
Irish 
is 
an 
American 
citizen," 
No 
the 
next 
subscribers 
himself 
in 
Iou 
as 
"An 
American 
citizen."
Evidently 
he 
used 
this 
expression 
to 
conceal 
his 
German 
ancestry. 
If 
this 
expression 
were 
used 
to 
conceal 
his 
Ger- 
man 
ancestry. 
What 
would 
we 
think 
if
