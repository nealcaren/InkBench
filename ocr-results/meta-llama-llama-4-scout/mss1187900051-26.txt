Friend Douglas,

I started from Rochester yesterday morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake.  Tonight at 6 oclock I was in the swamp a few rods north of the Bush Reservoir.  I attached a pocket instrument upon the wire and communicated with the person who took my place during my absence.  He telegraphed me the substance of your postal card.

Before I left home I read your telegram, and went to the Rock. Sav. Bk. where the draft was procured and notified them of its non receipt, and asked for a duplicate of it for a duplicate.  They said they could not give another until they had recd this one from the Clearing house at N.Y., which would be the first week in Sept.
