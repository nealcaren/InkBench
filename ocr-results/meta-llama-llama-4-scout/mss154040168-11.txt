I must express how much enthusiasm I have felt over your letter - more than you can
imagine. I too, have been eager to hear when - I am as ignorant as you - I know as when. I have been listening as a mild listener - I need watching I fear. The mail is VERY slow now after Panama is gone. You know that the last consignment for you, I had to leave is 
Brazil after I wrote when I thought yours en route. I learn that mail is not carrying and letters are a long 
way back you put off by vessels you sail. I was very enthusiastic letters as I 
have truly yours for you. I must go and address now I 
must say to this afternoon I I hope not 
for make the Sarah previous it I 
accept my best to you. 
Lovingly indeed!
