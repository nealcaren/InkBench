Bridport Dorsetshire
October 9 - 1866

My dearest dearest Florence,

I must thank thee for thy letter.  I was overjoyed to find our three months' tour through France, Italy & Sicily, just as we had left it.  We spent a few days at Woodcote, (near Henley on Thames) before leaving Bridport - and there we found dear old Florence so well & welcome better red with exercise.

You are always so greatly pleased to receive one of your niece's letters, & I am delighted to be able in this one to tell you all that I know you are anxious & eager to hear.  I was a fortnight in Italy, & there I found it was a country that I could cordially enjoy, tho' I must say I did not feel inclined to stay very long.  

I must say I like Woodcote, & I know you will have us there for another month.  It was as lively as Bridport for some time, to see our dear old Florence just as usual full of interest, & full of life, though she was so fortunately cap'd (coped) uninjured.  She had not been to church, to her pride, to tell thee, but has had a good time, to all appearance.
