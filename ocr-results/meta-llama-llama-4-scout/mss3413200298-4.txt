Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note about Mrs. Blackwell go unanswered, even to check I have to send the checks I had like to send. 

I have always admired Mrs. Blackwell, and in late years, I have loved her especially. Her always beautiful Christian spirit and her marvelous spiritual grace are such lovely additions to the great background of her life work.

It wrings my heart to know that she, too, is facing a financial vacuum. There are so many sources I would have thought of them myself, or at their disposal. But a stamp artist's handicap, I suppose I must raise. Being a stamp artist is a most painful handicap, in every way, but in particularly in respect to endurance, when one appears like that comes.

Thanks you for including me as one of her friends, - which I most heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett.
