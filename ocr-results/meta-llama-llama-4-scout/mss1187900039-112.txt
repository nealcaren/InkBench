Washington D.C.
Dec 6th 1872

Dear Father,

Yours of the 29th is just arrived. I have an account of one of your lectures in the N.York Tribune, and I thought that you might have other apprentice's not hearing from you. All is well except the baby. he has a severe cold; but hope not. I don't wish to trouble

your sound about the affair between Sathan, Fred, and my self. I know your mind and time as latter occupied. You may know the cause of the difficulty, but I will tell you the whole truth, and it is hard to find it out under the
circumstances. I am afraid that New York has given
of you will be as happy as
it for another man. I 
look for another wife. 
In a length of time I will write again soon, as I
am very busy just now. Lithie would send love if she knew
I was writing. Love to mother and all.
Your aff. Son
Cha's. N. Douglap
