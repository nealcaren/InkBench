Dear Sir,

I have thoughts of an expedient to bring in Caroline which I submit to you. It is this: Genl. Mobley is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi. Surely you will dispense with James & see Bene else & let him go delay his negroes & get all out that he has bought & I am sure bring for in a short time be out that it is an arrangement of men over which you have no control. What do you think of it? Let me know

Yours truly,
John St. Lewis
