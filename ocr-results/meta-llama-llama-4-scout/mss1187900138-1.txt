Dear Sir
Francis M. Alden of
Weymouth Mass. 86 Years of age decline the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration

"Father Abraham's monument"

This Monument would seem to say
That Lincoln's dead, but tis not so.
In vain the apassion arm to slay:
In vain his blood war made to flow.
In vain he fell; in vain we attempt to kill:
In all our hearts he's living still.
And while a drop of patriotic blood
Shall flow in any human frame,
It will thrill at Memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln Name.

This Monument we raise to thee
Great Christ, whose Mandates made us free
Our grateful thanks to thee, our true and 
Constant friend.

Also the following

"Adieu to America Perenne"

The World is gazing on thee 
Dispose Thy robes with Care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy Golden hair 
 "over"
