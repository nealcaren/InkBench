Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,
Chilmark,
Martha's Vineyard, Mass.

My dear Miss Blackwell:

Summer has come to a sudden end here and it is cooling off so fast that I suppose you will be creeping back to Boston soon.

I have now received a copy of your book. It is issued with excellent taste and I think it is just the right size for a biography.

I thank you most emphatically for the explanations you have made in your letter. After reading Mrs. Dorr's *Life of Miss Anthony* and which, of course, was only written in order to say that there never had been but two suffragists worth counting - Miss Anthony and Miss Paul, I happened to meet Harriet Stanton Blatch at the Women's University Club. She looked very old, sick, and frail. I spoke to her and asked if she had read Miss Dorr's book.  She said "no". I told her whacks. She smiled a little, but looked as though she had no intention of reading that biography.

I think there were some mysteries within the National wing about which I have received no hint. It has been my own notion that Mrs. Blatch hated Miss Anthony, but because she was a friend of her mother's, she did not make the fact public. 

Of course I never came in contact with Mrs. Stanton I had barely met her and had taken lunch at her house once or twice. I never liked nor admired her, although I had thought she had a rare gift with her pen and that some of her suffrage statements were beautifully constructed. I believe that Miss Anthony always thought she could exceed anyone else in style and strength of her appeal and that that was one reason why she clung to her, but I see that it is just possible that it is not affection and devotion or if there were other reasons. I still wonder.
