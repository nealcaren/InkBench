Collecting the Mourning Draperies.

Towards the close of the month, after the assassination of the President, observing the large quantity of costly drapery with which the merchants and citizens of New York had decorated their stores and residences, it occurred to me that as much of it (after its first use was concluded) would probably be wasted, it would be of much value to the poor widows and orphans of the soldiers.

Acting upon this idea, I issued the following notice in the newspapers, and in circulars addressed to the occupants of all buildings where a liberal display was observable :

New York State Soldiers' Depot,
50 and 52 Howard Street, New York City,
May 11, 1865.

To the Editors of the Evening Post :

As the "thirty days" time has now nearly expired when most of our citizens will remove the mourning drapery from their stores and dwellings, will you permit me to suggest that they can apply it to a use in harmony with the object for which it was originally procured, by sending it to this depot to be used for garments for the widows and orphans of New York soldiers. Our efficient Ladies' Committee will see that it is judiciously disposed of.

If not convenient for the owners to send it, our porters will gladly call for it, and its receipt will be acknowledged at any place in this city or Brooklyn, by forwarding the address to

Respectfully yours,
Vincent Colyer, Superintendent.

An inspection of the goods obtained, exhibited in a marked manner the disregard for cost animating the purchasersâ€”costly crape, bombazine, alapacca, and quantities of "silkesia" are found.  Over 12,000 yards, or $2,000 worth was obtained. The Broadway Bank, New York Club, Messrs. H. B. Claflin & Co., Bank of America, Trinity Church and others are among the contributors, whose names are inserted in the "Donors List" at back of this Report. The goods were packed in parcels containing enough for two or three dresses, and over three hundred soldiers' widows received the benefit of this enterprise.
