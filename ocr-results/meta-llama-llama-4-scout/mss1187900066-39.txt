Concord June 14 1885

Dear Friend:

You know perhaps I have felt
my book as a disappointment 
to my friends & mother, who were looking
for literary offspring of 
my John, mother clergyman eloquence
& so forth. I had not great 
strength & I could not 
give you what I learned 
but yet what I have learned 
I have advanced that 
and will send you 
an account of it. 
Besides XIV, an Ecce Homo
I shall send you 
to prepare you 
for the book.
