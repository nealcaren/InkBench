Boston Dec: 25-41

My dear Miss Dickerman

Yours. I favor of
the 19: Continuing a draft
for your Hundred dollars - 
which I should have
accepted at once: I could 
not safely let it remain; lest
when I should 
acknowledged its receipt 
at once: much 
unsettled both 
Leezie 
and myself. I do 
even go. little 
are more. Betting much
help to you & 
your Mother 
I remain
Ever yours. EmilyBaeKitt
