Monocacy. May 12. 1866.

My dear Sir,

Your kind favor came in due time; for which all thanks. 
Its suggestions were sterile of service, 
and its kind passing remark valuable 
to both of us. I will stay where 
I am at present.  He is at school, with an uncle 
at Georgetown 
in his salary of $200. and has also 
engaged to teach Elocution at the 
Catholic College, where his late 
Compensation will be liberal than he 
has had before. 
In addition to this,  he is a petitioner 
to try  at Public Reading - the next 
wonder -and can furnish 
with a list of the different Lyceums 
 & where he might.  I am able to 
make engagements if I can fix
