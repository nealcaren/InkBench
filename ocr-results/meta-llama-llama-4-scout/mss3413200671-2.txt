Dear Miss Blackwood:

The will be very glad indeed to have you on the committee even though you can take no active part. Enough James Hogg genses turned up to do the work, & no reasonable person could expect you to do the detailed work of the committee. 

We will probably have a banquet as soon as we can get speakers a place together, as that seems to be the time honored method of raising money.

The national committee informs me that a broadcasting _station with license_ can be bought for $50,000. But they want to raise more, a total of $60,000; partly to get a more powerfull station, & partly to have an endorcement to cover operating expenses in case the commercial users should attempt to boycott us.

Fraternally,
Alfred B. Lewis
