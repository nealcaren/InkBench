George L. Stearns, Esq., Boston, Mass.

Sir, - I lately received from you two communications, in which you advance certain propositions, and ask my influence and support for them.

1st. To organize the anti-slavery men of the country.

2d. To bring their combined influence to bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the social and political institutions of the Rebel States, and to remodel our financial system, in order to correct abuses growing out of slavery.

3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew, a seat in the Cabinet at Washington, as an able and faithful exponent of anti-slavery principles and measures.

I reply - I am not acquainted with the peculiar abuses of our "financial system" growing out of slavery, nor aware that some other candidate for a seat in the Cabinet might not be as proper as Gov. Andrew.

I.  Equality of the Human Race. God is "our Father." All men are brothers, and the distinction between a man and a beast is infinite. 

2d. Equality of rights. All human beings have an equal right - 1st, to life and liberty; 2d, the development and culture of body, mind, and moral nature. The Government should secure these to the State, because its health, wealth, prosperity and highest happiness depend upon the fullest possession and enjoyment of them. 3d, the right to property in the common elements of nature, - light, air, water, and the land.

The right to these elements is inalienable, because they constitute the elements of the human body, which could not for a moment exist without them, which caused God created them for the maintenance, in every age, of all the living.  They are a common gift, which no man has a right to monopolize, and which the governing Power is bound to secure to each citizen who needs them, or who desires them.

Responsibility of Government. Government is responsible for the equal protection and faithful promotion of the highest well-being of each individual within its domain.

4th. Monopolies. The State is bound by legislative obligations only so far as these were necessary to its life and well-being. No existing generation can, by its legislation, bind tile to the present generation to measures deemed hostile to the public life, health and happiness.

5th. The Franchise. On this subject I offer an illustrative statement before I give the principle.

In New Jersey the ballot-box is, in effect, sometimes set up openly for sale to the highest lot box.

"First pure."  (Bible.)  A corrupt use of the ballot-box is not the most odious kind. The purity therefore of the franchise should be guarded by the severest penalties.  Heavy fines, to go to informer on conviction of the offender, with imprisonment at hard labor, and partial loss of franchise for the first offence, and total loss for the second, would probably accomplish that end.

Purify, then, the election, - withdraw all sinister motives to a corrupt vote. Make the vote the simple expression of the uncorrupted sense and will of the voter, and open the franchise to every adult and human being.  Mind rules the universe. Give it an open field and fair play, and let the national will, protected from sinister motives, and guided by the national intelligence, create and maintain very in some form will ever feel its instantiate

That you may not mistake me, I will state a few fundamental propositions which I hold in common with you. I will not be dispenseable to that end.

1st. The unity and essential equality of the human race.

2d. Equality of rights.

3d, the right to property in the common elements of nature.

In a conference held by Secretary Stanton and General Sherman with the colored people of Savannah, soon after that city was taken, the chosen spokesman of the negroes was Garison Frazier. On being asked, "How can your people take care of yourselves?" he replied:  The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land and be allowed to work for ourselves, and till it by our own labor... All this man's replies were marked by uncommon shrewdness and good sense, but this excelled. How has he a country who has got no home? Who habitually sells himself to somebody for a day or week to get bread for his family? If, then, you wish to uproot slavery, break up land monopoly.  Twin strands of one rope, so strong every in some form will ever feel its instantiate

You have land and be guarded by the severest penalties.  Heavy fines, to go to informer on conviction of the offender, with imprisonment at hard labor, and partial loss of franchise for the first offence, and total loss for the second, would probably accomplish that end.

The third clause of my second proposition - "the right to property in the common elements" - is so important that I beg, in conclusion, to make a few remarks upon it.
