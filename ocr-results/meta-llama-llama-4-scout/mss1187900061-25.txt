Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 29, 1883.

Honorable John Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

I delivered an address on the occasion
of Emancipation as commemorated in the District of Columbia
and was particularly elated and pleased by your utterance
and complimented by your powers after
an almost constant defense
of that show for nearly a half cen-
tury in the cause of suppress-
ed people.
