Give Special Heed to these Directions.

This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions here given take for granted that those on the cover of No. 1 have been studied and followed. In this No. the letters formed from the first four principles are reviewed, and the stem-letters, $t, d, p, q$, are introduced.

The Contractions used are as follows :â€”m. l., Main Line; c. l., Connecting Line; m. s., Main Line Slope; c. s., Connecting Line Slope; m., Modified; pl., Parallel; P., Prim-ciples; E., Element.

The Diagram on the cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths. The copy made at each Count, the Principles, and the way the copy is to be placed in the lines.

SUGGESTIONS. 1. The only possible way of teaching Penmanship successfully in a school, is to have all the scholars of the class write the same line in the same book at the same time.

2. The order of instruction is Knowledge, Execution, Criticism.

First, Knowledge. Explain the copy carefully, and have it analyzed into its Principles and then into its Elements. Teach the nature, peculiarity, slope, beginning and ending of each element; notice the connections between the principles, and the combining lines between the letters; call attention to similitude and parallelism of parts and lines.

Second, Execution. Let them first trace the copy with dry pens. Then have one line in the column written by in the column written, directing the pupils to be very careful as to position, penholding, rests, and movements, which are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do

GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the sides of the oval written downwards; the ovals, the second upstroke of $b$ and $v$, and the second and fourth of $w$. See Manual, Chap. III. 4. The Connecting Lines are the rest of the curves written upwards. The Turns unite main and connecting lines. Sometimes the main and connecting lines unite in a point; this is termed a Connection. The line formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into one another at the middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 5. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes; the even, for the down strokes; the even, for the down 5. There are five Elements, in which they occur in the principles. There are six Principles in the small letters; from these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts, all the small letters are made.
6. Write down the columns always. 7. The m. s. is $50^{\circ}$ from base-line.

N. B. Teachers will find our Manual of Penmanship a complete compendium of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tablets and the Diagrams Principles, and Capitals, of large size and perfect form. The Oblique Lines are a great help to the scholars in acquiring correct slope.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES.

COPY 1. Knowledge. The 1's and 2's pl. are respectively. The top of 1 is a little more than half across the box. Mind the slope of 2's, and the distance between them.

more than half across the box. Mind the slope of 2's, and the distance between them. Observe Rules 1, 2, 3, 7. Analyze P. 1 from Diag. on cover. P. 1 has been fully explained in No. 1, which see. Its analysis is P. 1 = E. 1 + $\frac{1}{2}$ E. 2 + $\frac{1}{2}$ E. 3. Notice that the left side of the oval touches the base line and pl. to the first 2, with which the right side of the turn has to coincide and directly the turn has to directly the turn has to make against making a broad turn by turning too soon on the left, or sagging down on the right side.

EXECUTION. First, trace the copy a few times dry. Position, Penholding, Rests, and Movements. Next count. Thus, "Ready," (which means place the pen over, but not on the spot they are count), "1, 2," "ready" or "up," "2, 1."

CRITICISM. Ask questions on all the particulars in the corner? "How many did not?" "How many made the top of 1 far enough across?" "How many made this curve?" "How many made the right curve?" "How many made this across?" Show on the board what you mean.) "How many made first 2 straight? Second 2 straight through $\frac{1}{2}$? Turn too broad? Too nar-
