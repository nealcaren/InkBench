I went to see
Benj. T.  Smith Dec. 15 1893

I am so sorry I have not seen you in
the course of my visits   I have not given you credit
for having given me so many marks of friendship,
but I do now and thank you very much for all
your kindness   I have the pictures you spoke of
and your picture has come too - that is one
of the most satisfactory portraits of yourself
that I have seen   I wish it were as good as
Sargent's pictures - but it is as good as any 
I have seen of him so far and I am sure No. 
[???] will be worth while. The look is too
serene  I am so sorry I have troubled
you so much about Annie's ailments, but 
I am sure you know I feel so bad that 
they have worried me out of all
