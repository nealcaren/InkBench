Mr. Frederick Douglass
Washington D.C.,

Dear Sir,

I am an old abolitionist and have labored to be a zealous Republican ever since the organization of that party. I have resided in the south a greater portion of the time since the civil war and am in very humble sphere. I have been a friend to you and to me that the curse of absolute slavery still rests upon this country and I fear heavily upon this colored race. I refer the enclosed circular to present in proof that the opinion of absolute abolition by law is still rooted in the country and has vigorously refen the colored race.

Yours,
Marion Anthony
