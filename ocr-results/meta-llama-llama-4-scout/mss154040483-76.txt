The question for our consideration is whether the department of 
Election Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it a part of 
the work of the League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less 
appealing to many women, but for that very reason it is more necessary for 
women voters to comprehend its need.

If any other department of the League should be dropped, for example, Women 
in Industry, Social Hygiene, Child Welfare, other organizations would be responsible 
for the necessary work to be done, as they were before these departments were 
adopted by the League of Women Voters; but if the political department is dropped 
there is no other body of women to take it up.

We were enfranchised in 1920. We ought to have been enfranchised twenty 
years earlier at least, and that is not mere talk. The reason why we were 
not enfrranchised long before some of you were old enough to take an interest 
in public questions was that government by the people rarely functions in this 
country, and it does not really function anywhere in the world as yet. There 
are many causes why it does not function and any one of these causes may 
nor really function anywhere in the world as yet. There 
are many causes why it does not function and any one of these causes may 
be sufficient to delay normal progress in a government such as ours.

Controlling Groups

A small group of people determined 
to oppose promised legislation, if provided with money, were the brewers 
and distillers, may hold back legislation and prevent action being taken, 
even though the masses of the people demand action. What the wets did to the 
suffrage movement other groups of people have done and may do for other great 
causes. Such groups of people 
make controlling contributions to political parties and in return secure promises 
of no action in legislatures or Congress, provided that party is elected to power.

It may secure the orders of that party, 
all the way down the line to the most 
remote rural election district chairman,
to defeat a referendum.

Why were the railroads fighting ratification in Tennessee? Certainly not 
because the railroads cared whether 
women voted or not. Why was the 
Manufacturers' Association there to 
work against ratification? It was because these interests, quite disconnected, 
combined their lobbies to help the pro-
gram of any one of them with the 
expectation that all the lobbies would be 
combined in support of their own pro-

Here is the address made by Mrs. Catt 
at the Cleveland Convention of the 
League of Women Voters when, at her 
suggestion, the Committee on Election 
Laws and Methods was elevated to a department of work called Efficiency in 
Government. This speech was felt to be 
so fine an expression of the failure of 
our governmental machinery to register 
the people's wishes that it has been 
repeatedly asked for by our readers.

Government.  This speech was felt to be 
that any value to them. What happens 
then, because there 
is a conflict between the state and the 
nation and because political machines 
and bosses do so much political juggling 
over issues.

Reform, therefore, is needed all along 
the line. It is needed in the election 
of the President of the United States and 
all the way down to the dog-catcher in 
the smallest village.

Where We Need Reform

Perhaps we need it most in our plat-
form making. Ours is a country 
governed by parties. Parties are of tremendous 
power in this land, so tremendous 
that they can give the order whether a 
referendum submitted by the legislature 
shall be carried or rejected, and the 
people have little or nothing to say 
about issues to be included. Party loyalty 
is relied upon to carry the ticket 
pledged to the platforms and party 
loyalty usually successfully accomplishes 
the aim set by the managers.

There are three main reasons for this 
proposed change:

First.  We were a political body when 
we were working for the suffrage and 
we secured the vote by political action.
