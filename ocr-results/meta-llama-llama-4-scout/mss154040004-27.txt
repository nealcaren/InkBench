Uitenhage and Benoni.  We "did" Bulawayo while passing through and visited Victoria Falls for pleasure.  This makes 13 towns visited, including the capitals of the four provinces composing the Union of S.A. and two places in Rhodesia.  I conducted the entire correspondence arranging for the trip, engaging hotels, etc. and wrote many letters concerning the convention held in Durban. Several towns invited us to visit them and these invitations I had to decline.  I think this part of the work was more arduous than any of the party comprehend. The statistics which follow apply to myself alone, as the program followed was not quite the same for any two of us.

I made 13 public speeches, each exceeding one hour.  I made 22 additional speeches, none shorter than 10 minutes and several varying from 40 minutes to one hour -- total 45 speeches.

There were seven receptions; 18 luncheons, 3 being given by Mayoress of Pretoria, Johannesburg and Durban, one by Mrs. Botha, wife of the Premier, one by Mrs. Hull, wife of Minister of Finance. I attended 14 afternoon teas; 3 morning teas; 6 dinners; 3 picnics; 12 committee meetings.

Of the 76 days, 11 and a half days full and 11 nights were spent on the train. About two weeks or 14 full days were spent in sightseeing which included four days at Victoria Falls, an excursion to Camp's Bay and a day's drive to Cape Town; a visit to an Ostrich Farm and the Ostrich Market in Pt. Elizabeth; a visit to a farm in Bloemfontein; a visit to the DeBeers Mines in Kimberley; a visit to the Premier mine in Pretoria; a visit to the Dynamite factory in Johannesburg; a visit to a Kaffir Kraal in Maritsburg.   Each of the above took the whole of a day, but sometimes tired nature was prodded up to go to something

in the evening. The 36 days spent in sightseeing and travel left 40 days spent with suffragists. The functions including public meetings number 76, making an average of nearly two things each day.  We made many visits to railroad stations, Cooks, etc., visited many shops in search of postals and photos, did some shopping, and incidentally visited many places of interest which could be put in when there was time to spare.  These last mentioned incidentals included visits to eight museums, all of which 

we found extremely interesting and instructive. 

The above record was performed in a climate varying from cold which required loading ourselves with all the clothes possible, and sleeping with hot water bottles, bed shoes and flannel nightgowns, to tropical heat rendered endurable only by the continual whirr of electric fans.

I should add to the above record three and a half days spent with the convention in Durban.

Now, passing up the East Coast, we visited 7 additional towns belonging to East Africa.

This record would not be complete without listing the reading done in connection with it and which was the necessary preparation for understanding the conditions of this part of the world.
