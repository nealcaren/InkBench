The Woman Citizen

Your Investments
By Eleanor Kerr

Two policies issued by insurance companies which 
are very popular and which are more or less on the endowment order mentioned in our last article, are income bonds and retirement annuities.

Many women—and men, too, of course—who have no one dependent on them and wish to provide themselves with savings from which to receive an income in the future, find the purchase of income bonds one of the safest methods of assuring this. The purchaser makes annual payments until a certain age, after which date the insurance company usually agrees to return to her the total amount of deposits which have been made. And even if the purchaser dies after having reached the stipulated age and received some of the income payments, but not approximately $11 ½ per cent. in the latter case, the profit to the insurance company, of course, lies in the fact that interest on the money as it is accumulating during the twenty or thirty years is not paid out, but goes into the company's treasury. From the business man's point of view, this makes the interest received on the money enables to be used. It is hardly credit that, when the full facts are laid before the world's inspection, government that, when these resolutions of the Advisory Committee have passed through the necessary technical steps, they will be referred to the various national legislatures for ratification. Adequate legislation for their enforcement must then be passed. And when that is done, as said at the time of the discussion in the Third Assembly, the greatest blow ever dealt at the traffic will have been struck.
