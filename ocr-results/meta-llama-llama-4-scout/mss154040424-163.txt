Six years; six years to observe the infirmities of American politics, you have had, women of America.  Will you allow any power whatsoever to steal from you the significance of the vote you struggled so long to win?  My suggestion is probably impractical.  The only thing certainly right about it is the proposal of rebellion.  No wrong was ever righted by obedience to those who have sponsored that wrong.  Wrong was ever righted by rebellion against those who stand for that wrong.  Think it over, pray, think again.  Keep on thinking.  You will find a way.  When you have it, arise, put aside your ease, your soft indulgencies.  There is work for you.  The primaries need reforming, the parties need renovating and all politics need disinfecting.  Is it true that you women have no influence as regulars, as standpatters?  Then try the path of rebellion and blaze a new trail to decency and honor for your party and your nation.  You can have influence if you will.  Yes, a hundred fold more influence than the Pennsylvania statesman has now.

But you can only win through rebellion.  The times call for the fighting spirit of the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence.  You have influence whenever you are ready to fight for it.  When that time comes, you women will not fight alone.  There will be plenty of splendid, big-souled American men to fight by your side.  Do not forget that they are many- the men who bore the humiliation of being so-called rubber stamps before you were enfranchised.  We must not think of strength but of where      the fatal  of every leg it       is strong  They need double nor high         they don't care the  Hose wives  jete        POTE     COME

"It's great to be out where the fight is strong
To be where the heaviest troops belong
And to fight there for man and God."

Phrases we curse you when it is progress
    Never fear, they will lay you please  I have seen the men and women who go under shall be the instruments of the revenge
