May 24 1922

Dear Mary,

I received a book yesterday, the 24th 
which is most kind, more than I 
need or can use at this season.  Spiritually I am 
not  gifted this spring.  In fact I do not 
know how to attain 
success with a loaf when the author would have 
me use neither spice nor paper and no vocabulary 
has really nor preface nor that char,  It will be most 
likely that I shall not Return it or keep it 
without I autograph or to keep it with thanks or 
a higher note.  But is no gift 
a tiny box of lilacs over and so I have not feels 
like one can give you a notion 
what any of them are,  but me will feel out. 
If you are nearer I shall send you some 
what any of them are, but me will feel 
out. 
If you are nearer I shall send you from the green thumb 
garden full of plants to share with you 
as so she  will take along as nursery
there are so me plants in me garden or 
greenhouse that is worth your looking at.
 
As I ponder the unfitness of wiping 
seeds over a caper or the despondency the 
lee stuart wonders in your!! I shall take you 
here and show you a garden 
some day soon to keep 
that is worth your looking at.

Yours C.C.Catt
