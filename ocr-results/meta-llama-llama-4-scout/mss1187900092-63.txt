My dear Dr. I am of yours to-day,
though I heard you hurt it. I
need your speech, though I
knew I hurt it; pleasure and credit,
I had more misused with it as I could,
last night I read it to my father, he
has much pleased with me 
in pronouncing of it. You did
deliver it throughout the County, still
it does not sound so good.
 
Your tr. Wm. Smith
