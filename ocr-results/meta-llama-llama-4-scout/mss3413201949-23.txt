(1) The Senseless Waste of War 

When the great war began $7 billions of gold was coined. The gold standard meant that there was not sufficient gold to back all the world money. The total coin money and bullion in circulation in the whole world was only eleven billions dollars.  The war came and the nations plunged all their gold into the war, borrowing all they could, printing paper money. Not stopping to think of the cost.  At the end the international debt became so complicated and burdensome that a universal panic followed. What senseless waste!  Any wonder they can not pay their debts now?

Do you know that every man killed in the late War cost the living $1500?

Let me read you a little dialogue, an extract of a conversation between a king and his prime minister, in the 3rd century before Christ - read from Proverbs of the Confucian.

2 Who are the people to kill

When the generation that has not experienced war ceases to fear the dread of the glory of War but knows the facts and refuses to repeat such history - when women detest the glamour of war trappings, war music, war propaganda and take intelligent stand in elections.
