Journal Friends

There is a suffrage festival here
Nov 14th and 15th and we are to have a
Journal booth. Can you and
we any decorations and a large card
to have outside." Newsy to say.

I have sent Mother about 30 circulars (?)
but so far we have done nothing of this sort and
have little idea how to go about it.

But Dr. McNaughton who is getting up the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of creating a booth for the
suffragist and if she. Dr. Mae N. said that
Dr. Mae N. had to pay
the cost of erecting the booth she would at
I be used for the Journal the paper she
preferred to help- & promised to see to it
