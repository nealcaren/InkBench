farm lots which I need to secure its payment by a mortgage or from stocks, implements & household furniture. The stock consists of 4 fine horses, 3 fine cows, a fine alderney milk cow, a fine aldrery 

 

four oxen? If you can trust so 
to inform me, I assure I have all the necessary 
papers executors take them & I 
any day you may come.
 
    I feel, I beg your pardon, that 
while our claims upon you are nothing 
beyond you regard for their merits, 
pleading is unnecessary. If you 
can do it, I entreat you to 
help me to secure them.
 
    As I am I deeply pitiable 
for want of security in collecting them. 
Please write me as early as this week 
as if need be I might employ
