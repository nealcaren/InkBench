My dear Mary:-

I feel perfectly ashamed for not having 
written to you all these weeks.  I've been 
saying  I'm going to do it each day 
and I did not want to send you a hurried note but a real 
letter full of details which no one else could give you. 
Mrs Catt reads me parts of your letters 
and we are both much interested in your lovely 
trip and so glad you are having such 
a grand time.  You certainly Can give the livelyest 
disciples of things and we much enjoy the 
amusing spirit and nut.  Well to begin with 
the beginning.  Before I Came, I was certainly 
very worried about Mother Catt and I fear Child 
not await the day to land.  Then I Came on 
a Saturday afternoon Dec: 9th 
Ludy was waiting for me on the platform in 
New Rochelle.  I can imagine that the first 
two days there was very very much to talk about 
and to tell.  The dear lady first poured it all out 
to me and it seemed to relieve her greatly although 
there were many tears.  I still felt the liked to tell
