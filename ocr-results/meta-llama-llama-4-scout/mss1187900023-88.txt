Belsham & Hopkins have been in this city 2 weeks,  I have had two meetings. I shall accompany him to Belfast in June or in part of July.  He will have felt  to him self sorry to be with them all Ash. but I will not know a book to tell you something which will make you think me and most fickle of men- I have decided to stay in the Country five months long: and I should not wonder if Mr. Wright should think the same though I have less reason than I have to stay.  I am staying. I have decided to stay in consequence of the advice both of Mr. Garnier and Mrs. Thompson. Both think the place is a most favorable one for modelling. and I think it would be wrong for me to miss it. I have therefore decided to stay.
