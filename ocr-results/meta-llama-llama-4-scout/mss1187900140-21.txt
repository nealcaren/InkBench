dear Paris. You really ought
to come over & see me before
traveling becomes a worrying
& of course you make our home
& house & read quarters for
the youth of England. We are
living in a very pretty
country district, with open
den & pleasantly hilly & undulating country
not grand in its features
but very pleasing. I know
I shall like it here. Some of
our favorite walks - I  like
to introduce you to some of
my dear friends.

My dear Marion is still
living &  often absent.
