No. 61. Monkey Temple. Two hundred monkeys live
in the trees surrounding the temple. Only one
got in the picture. They eat from the hands
of strangers and the mother monkeys snatch
away their babies when they think they have
had enough, and run up the trees with them.

No. 62. The burning ghat of the Hindus on shore of 
Ganges. The body on the frame is tying feet in the
holy water of the river before burning. About six
attendants sweep ashes, and unburned fingers, legs or arms
into the river.
