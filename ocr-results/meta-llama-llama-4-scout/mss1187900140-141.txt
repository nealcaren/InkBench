Emigrating to America -
 
a great many emigrants on the steamer 
which has just arrived, were landed here 
this week; this brings up to the 
number 330, those who have 
come to this country during the 
month of April. I hear that 
applications for land are 
begining to pour in - that 
the local authorities here 
are quite unprepared to 
deal with them.

It is to be seen and feared 
that much inconvenience 
will be experienced in the 
matter of land claims.
