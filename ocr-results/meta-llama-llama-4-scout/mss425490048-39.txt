St. Etienne Loire France
1916.

My dearest Georgia:

Just a brief word 
to you a Christmas wish and be sure 
of my sympathy and trust for you awaiting 
and  that of the same time.

I know only of fourteen in the list 
of the families of the twelve who 
are going and I can assure you 
they will make as much of you as 
they can when you are with them.

Sincerely your friend,
Helen.
