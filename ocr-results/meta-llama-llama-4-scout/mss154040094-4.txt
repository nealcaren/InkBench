I think that is quite unusual  for a seventeen year old boy, so if you could find it to be so on day, I would be very happy indeed.  
Please remember me to Miss Milburn & Mrs. Peik and be sure to let me know if they or you come to Washington. 
With affectuate regards
gratefully yours,
Florence H. Darty
