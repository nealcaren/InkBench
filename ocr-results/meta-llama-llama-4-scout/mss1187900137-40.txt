Mr. B.F. Leighton,

Dear Sir:

Yours of the 6th was duly received; the Check No. 2 which was care-fully noted by Mr. Lewis Douglas.

In reply, he desires me to say that he has no disquietim, whatever, as to making any change regarding a stone step in the premises referred to in your letter.

On the contrary, he desires Mr. Nelen Slanglass' attention called to the fact that said premises is in immediate need of improvements both in and out, the walls, the broken blinds, and especially the Sanitary apartments, make it almost unbearable. It is so sadly in need of a coat of paint, which, in its consequent prospect, makes a most detectable appearance. 

It is the only residence in that immediate neighborhood that stands as a discredit to the Landlord.

Respectfully yours,
25.95 cents
Joseph Douglas
Clerk.
