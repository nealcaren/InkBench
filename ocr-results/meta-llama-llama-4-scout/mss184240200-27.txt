I have a poor week when I hear it !!!  I want to have his Juries when I am absent; surely I prefer more silence where I 
have the same cheerful voice as he is 

I don't know why you wanted to see that rough letter I'm my western friend but I make a 
copy - Goodbye 
again 

with heartfelt 
health 
 affliction as I think of 
all the trouble my dear 
facets the right 
Now Be kind 
July
