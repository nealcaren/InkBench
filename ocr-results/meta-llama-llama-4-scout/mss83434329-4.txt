Sir,

I would not, at once, entirely emancipate him from the control of his master. But I would not be so now, arbitrary, unqualified control. For that I could not substitute the authority of law, which should be SUPREME. In saying this, I do but carry out a principle which I have laid down to myself as a cardinal principle in my private creed, that all individuals, associated, and all institutions, should be maintained in, and still maintain, as a cardinal principle in my private creed, that I am not to be interfered with by law; and, for the obvious reason, that he is not fitted to enjoy them. But I would not destroy, if possible, his special benefit, and adapted to his new condition--laws which should secure his master over him--laws which should protect him in all his rights which he is fitted to enjoy, and prepare him for the enjoyment of those to which it would be a suicidal philanthropy to subject him to this degraded class of men to prepare them for freedom; * and, for the obvious reason just adverted to, this philosophy will not do.

Sir, I express, I believe, the universal sentiment at the North on this subject. We are not insensible to the danger of attempting any emancipation whatever. The sentimental portion of our nature should not be unduly excited; and, on the other hand, we should not shun all ardent philanthropy as once that I could wish it! Still, there can be no doubt that it is the great, the vast, the immeasurable superiority of the North, that has given us the lead in this matter. People in the North have not been content to censure; they have devised, and, in many instances, carried out, measures of emancipation. And shall they not be followed by our people here? Shall they not emulate their example? I do not believe it. But for the people of this District, that which breathes of charity, benevolence, and justice, is something to be exerted in some shape to advance their pru- 

dence. The slave trade is an evil for coercing their prudence. I am well aware that I have been told that there is no defence, and no palliation to be urged for continuing this enormous evil, no! and no defenceless service within this District, for that it has a strong argument referring to content and character within this District. But the fact that I have no such means, furnishes a strong argument for referring to it. 

This *petition repeats what I said to you, that I do not like it that our citizens will not tolerate "rate its existence among them." 

If Sir, I tell you, I believe, the universal sentiment at the North, or all that I have ever heard from individuals, while here, as well as in the country, directly from the mouths of our citizens, or by letter, that there is to be content with what they "can do." It is not that that irritates; it is inexorable oppression; an obvious sense for being condemned, as the North appears to it, to "envy:"

Is this realistic? I must ask; and do you think this prospect is in view!

DO UNTO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM.

Sir, I will not comment on this preempt. It appears to me that I will have to resign. It seems to me, Sir, that the sentiments of the North are not fairly understood here. There can be no doubt that our Northern friends have given great mass of the Northern people are opposed to any action on this subject. Indeed, in many of your public meetings, the resolutions there adopted, have been perplexing to the point of a constant mention of slavery and the slave trade in this Territory. Slaves of luxury have been indignantly offered. And it is not unnatural that they should be so disposed of; and that not so far disposed of any longer to be upheld simply on high seas of effusiveness! Shall we contemplate that our Northern friends have warmly and earnestly appealed to the Southern interest and excitement; and that there is a growing moral sense in our citizens here feels that even we have no government!

CASH FOR 200 NEGROES.

"CASH FOR 200 NEGROES.

Sir, there are very many of those who are disposed to offer specific regulations for the administration of slavery, and some of the objections, some of the objections, which I have heard to the above advertisement, are very strong arguments against to prescribe specific regulations for the administration of slavery, or to proclaim specific precepts, before whose searching prompt and oppression shall melt away.

In had said that the public sentiment at the North is not nearly uniform on this subject.
