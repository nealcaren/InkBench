to read lectures on "Famous Women".  As Roumanian 
and I will do it, so in I.D.S.I.F. and Vice popular evening course.

But as there are no complete libraries in Roumania and I must 
a "single feminist library" it is impossible for us even to know 
the title of the book necessary for our purpose. I beg you 
to you as to the other sections of I.D.S.F. to ask your help. 

Teelings so much the lips of a few library we will 
try at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and 
perhaps the will be able to assemble around it the 
Women's a club as, we are dreaming of since a long time. 
I told you association be able for he generous act of yours 
Help with sisters and send us one of the best biographical  work 
on women movement in your country and specially 
on women, there we could find biographies of your famous women.

We would speak in a first serie of lectures, on public and social 
problems Women and in a second Draw the portraits of Women 
and art and Science." But we know so little, it is to say not much
