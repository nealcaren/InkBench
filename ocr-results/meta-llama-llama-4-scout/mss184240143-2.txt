My dear Mr. Dressimen,

I am afraid your business
affairs are again suffering. I'm not
the faintest able to cope
nor is thy cash a little bit. "Me & you as seemed" 
bur "Can't Keep a Habit". I am sorry,
I am sorry. I think I know
what joe & I "McCready" it might have
been now in a different position.
You loted me you would do me about
your Theatrical business to write. I hear
you have "a Boy" (as it were) doling
up with your affairs & " Mixing thou Onion up".
I thought you had a dear experience
before with "Anatole" managers that
taught ye by experience the Value of management
our that; I am sending you only that I
feel Sleghted. I Conced to be more for you than any
man in this bussingl, er ouring sttik that
Matter ye needed (or will) has been done it cheerfully,
