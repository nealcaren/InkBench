No man has equaled in the past and none 
can hope to exceed in the future.  No 
Nor do I think the obfuscation end with the race. 
The whole nation has reason to be grateful 
for the large and lofty example of patriotism given in the man and so beautifully and fitly expressed in the oration.
I can only add my individual thanks 
from the depths of my heart for the strong 
and true words of wisdom, given 
by way of advice to my own people and 
for the benefit which will result to each 
and all of us because of the task 
which your oration will have before 
the better portion of the white people of the 
country. The task of soothing 
and hoping that you may 
be spared many, many years to instruct 
and influence for good this Great American 
nation- I am, my dear friend, most 
Gratefully Yours) William G.A. Hart.
