It seems like a dreary fate to elapse upon a hill.  But I have enjoyed your Feb 28th so much;  and how glad I should be afwaits to welcome you - should you be tempted to take the trouble of visiting me!!!  We are all quite well here, excepting poor Kitty of Darling.  and Pinkerton.  Sickness and death have been present.   A dear cousin of mine, Mrs. Lynch, who received your wish to Belfast forty two days ago.  I am glad that I shall have the pleasure of welcoming you back.
