Miss Mary Gray Peck,
R.D. No.2
Geneva, N.Y.

My dear Miss Peck:

In the "Woman's Journal" of next week there will be a statement concerning boarding houses, hotels and steamers, and this is the best I can do in the way of information.

I am expecting to sail on March 31st. I have made my application for space on the North German Lloyd, but if I fail there I shall try for a steamer sailing the same date on the Hamburg-American line. Miss Hey is going with me. Do you want to go as early as that? It would be a great pleasure to have you go with us. I do not suppose you would enjoy staying in Stockholm so long, but if not you could remain in Germany, as I think you wanted to be there a while anyway.

I have written to ask Mrs. Potter to stay with me when she is in New York about the 1st of March. I hope I shall catch her. I presume she will not care to go until later in the season,-but there is one advantage, you do get the winter rates in the month of March, and that is something. I think it is important that you should engage your passage soon, as I find the places are largely taken on all the lines, and the best and cheapest rooms go first.

I have sent your name again to Miss Shaw today, together with other names in hand, as I candidiate for a delegateship. Will you tell me as soon as you can whether you will positively go or not, and also tell me if you would like me to engage steamer passage for you.

Yours cordially
Carrie Chapman Catt
