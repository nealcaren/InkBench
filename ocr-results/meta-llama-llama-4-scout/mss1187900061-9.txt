Instead of Marking Murlla 
I'd try send you a line. I hope
you will excuse Bad writing
and Spelling as you will find.
I have seen Miss Briggs twice since you
left.  Everything is going 
on just the same as do I have
no news to tell you all are well at
home hoping that you are.  Rosa is well
and sends love to you.

Truly your friend
Louisa Sprague
