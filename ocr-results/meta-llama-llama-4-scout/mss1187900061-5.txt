Washington D.C.  
July 13. 1883.

Dear Grandpa,

Your affectionate letter of the 12th stand we were very glad to hear from you, and to know that you are getting along nicely.  Everything is passing along smoothly here, excepting the weather, which is at times intolerable.  It is now a bout nine o'clock and the thermometer stands as 84 1/2.  Charlie has not left yet for the Eastern.  I doubt whether he will or not, I think the latter as I don't  fear Thursday any.
