were ob your knees. Nevertheless
should not come; a father's house
a father's home, a father's welcome 
will be given you. You would 
find me in very pleasant 
surroundings, not quite,
not quite so much as I have on Cedar 
Hills, yet go very well adapted to 
this climate and country. 

I note what you say of young 
Cosbie. I am sorry to learn that 
he has made so little progress, 
but I feel more lonely since I 
know that he served free 
which no mean trials. She 
did a good deal for him 
and I am sure that she would have 
dwone much more thanks. Gratitude 
is not a very strong 
feature of the Colored race,
or I think
