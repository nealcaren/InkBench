Dec. 13/ 1873

we may be in want of carriage 
Feb 7 might find us,  Meeting Wells are very 
forward, such you may be sure we 
never expect.  We never did till 
my dear sister came against 
the premonitions of heart 
After trials of skill 
sufficient, & poor 
 recovery of colonel 
is painful and 
 Dreary Letters 
can go 
through, as I can 
see.  The way the 
where it is clear to 
one must j feel - 
when  yellow fever 
may have
us & as work 
to the 
city 
and on a 
new place 
for us
Ir Ma 
I never 
find you 
the pile 
of you 
estates
Practically 
May 0 
affect
you the 
go 
at last
