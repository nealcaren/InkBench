VISITEDMOTHER'SHOMESTEAD

ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROSWELL, GA., AND ATLANTA.

Many Tender Recollections of His

Early Childhood Awakened by

Visit to the Old Homestead.

ROSWELL, Ga., October 20.—President
Roosevelt today carried out his long-cher-
ished plan of visiting the home of his
mother—Roswell, Ga. One of his reasons
for coming south was that he might see one
of homestead where his mother spent her girlhood and which she left a happy bride. That visit was fraught with many tender recollections, evident, and as his carriage drove away from the old Bulloch mansion, where his mother lived and married, the President murmured to Mrs. Roosevelt: "I can hardly bear to leave her here." The President reached Roswell at 7:30 o'clock this morning and was joined here by Senator and Mrs. Clay, who were here as guests at breakfast. He then entered a car-riage and was driven to the mansion. This fine old homestead is now the property of D. J. Wing, a lumber merchant of this section, who lives in it with his sister, Mrs. Wood, the postmaster of Roswell. Here he was greeted by two old servants who lived on the place during his mother's tenure of young womanhood. One of these is "Aunt Grace," who acted as maid to Miss Martha Bulloch, who afterward became Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt. The other is William Wood, who lives here.

The President was deeply touched as he entered along the line of the parade from the terminal to Pla-tonk, where the Georgia State Association is holding its annual exhibition, decorations were plentiful. The national colors floated from every building along the way, and as business houses bowed to the presidential train rolling in that poured along Peachtree street. Pictures of the President were seen on every side, many bearing mottoes of praise and commendation to the city's distin-guished guest.

Everywhere along the line of the parade from the terminal station to Plank Park, where the Georgia State Association is holding its annual exhibition, decorations were plentiful. The national colors floated from every building along the way, and as business houses bowed to the presidential train rolling in from business houses along the way, flowers were strewn along Peachtree street.

Reception at Atlanta.

ATLANTA, Ga., October 20.—The day broke clear, but soon after sunrise heavy clouds overcast the sky, presaging rain and causing much anxiety that * the program arranged for President Roosevelt's visit might be seriously delayed by rain. Thousands of residents of Atlanta were multiplied by throags of sightseers from the surrounding

If I feel as if you were here
oh, my friends, I hardly dare to say how
deeply my heart is moved by coming back
to Roswell, to the home of my
earliest recollections as a child is hearing
from my mother and my aunt, Miss Annie
Buboch as she was then, about Roswell
and the farm and the Dunwoody's
and Bullochs came here first to settle;
about the old homestead, the house on the
hill; about the Chautauqua about all
kinds and sorts of incidents that would
not interest you, but interested me a great
deal when I was a child. I wish I could
spend hours here to look all through and
see the different scenes about which I have
heard all kinds of incidents.

"All those anecdotes, looking back now,
I can see, taught me an enormous amount,
perhaps all that I know, and at the same
time I see that they were not intended to teach anything. I think
perhaps we are very apt to learn most when
neither we nor the people talking to us
tend to teach us anything. If anybody
starts to teach us something we are a
little apt to resent it and assume a rather
repellent attitude. All those stories of the
life of those days that a real neighbor life was and
(home?) recessals now are what
