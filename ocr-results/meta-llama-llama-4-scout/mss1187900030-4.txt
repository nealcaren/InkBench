dear brother - we have not received one 
answer yet, dear sister one 8 o'clock tonight. It 
has been beautiful weather ever since you left -
been beautiful weather ever since you left - 
and I do fear - think we will have plenty. 
Elizabeth is making preparations to read. 
her lecture next - monday night I do not leave 
us on tuesday or wednesday of next - week. 
I believe she has nearly all her appointments 
taken but - I think A.Brown said she 
will attend & it 
being a great deal of noise and confusion best 
to have her out of sight for a little while 
B. Brown offered for his capture and I 
Old Brown 
told has given himself up 
Mother wishes me to give her love, 
and enclosed, you will find a note 
from Elizabeth and perhaps 
Annie will send a few lines.

Your Affectionate
Daughter
Harriet Douglass
