Dear Mr Douglass

It is a very long time since we have written to you, or heard from you, and we most anxiously have been looking for a reply. We really are much perplexed in the dark about you; and I do most earnestly wish you still hold office under the government, as we have not been, to the contrary I conclude that you are still helping & holding meetings over the country this winter as of old.

I hope that you are well & that you can report well of yourself & of your family
