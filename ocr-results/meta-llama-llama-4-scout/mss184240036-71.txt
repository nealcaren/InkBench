- first to our Chaffeeheath, -
our fives fired for the
hills, - our whips gone to
Bits. - 

That sight of ale what
a wight. -
the Stee lakes. - the
fire which keeps standing
in myriad ranks of the
sides of the Mountain
about it. - the dark lines
of huts crowding against
the green trees.  The Stee
towers larger & brighter than
one sees in the distance
land - our crude camp
fires burning, - yet have for
the life of me no
collective -
