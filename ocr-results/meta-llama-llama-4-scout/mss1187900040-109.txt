But if I really seem to be 
I am weaker - weaker to, than 
what I was with Jane. 
Every thing seems against 
me - it seems hard that 
thy very means & way 
of living are the great 
source of all the pain 
to thee - for it is 
terribly cruel to be 
afflicted, to be 
unattended & to be 
abandoned. by those 
that have such means - 
when calamities are 
borne in common 
it is not so great 
to bear - than the losses which 
Every blow breaks the heart. 
When I came home 
from the funeral 
last night I found 
your letter - which 
gave me such a shock 
that I was obliged 
to lay down. I have 
not been able to 
speak or see any 
one yet. I am so 
full of sorrow 
for poor dear 
Mary - that 
I can hardly 
bear to think 
of it - still I 
am better 
today - I 
think I shall 
get over it 
in time.
