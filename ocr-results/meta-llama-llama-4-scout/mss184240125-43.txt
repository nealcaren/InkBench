I came to Boston on Nov. 2d
to make a short visit before winter, & 
I can still hear you asking for 
me to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only 
been to the opera a few times. I have 
seen none of the celebrities, they were 
too costly.  My heart is not broken, else 
I might be unhappy.  I thought I should 
see you here this spring, because the Papers 
say so, but I see he has been a trying winter, 
but Spring & violets are near the door.
Cozie writes me often, & is happy if 
her bit of house-work suits her. 
But if she is shut in, she 
chafes. She has a good practical mean, & 
'off and' chafes. The harness 
back breaks from strain & things. 'Taint 
easy.  So blest you dear, always.

Lovingly- Mama Day.
