Dear Miss Blackwell -

I am blessed with a propensity to be always at something.  You are somewhat quix; still you will not draw an illogical conclusion, as true successor of spunk might tempt a less reasonable creature to do.

The truck is hot: hot, hot beyond
creded, to say nothing of dust.  What resource else 
was left but you.  The other evening,  & or 20 are 
spoken of to me as having done Greta and that 
as nurse in The war,  I was called on to advise
her.  I shall say, Iyes, I admire what she dia.
But must she not be a noble woman to do 
so much.  Then I said it-in my will for us 
you and she  - me, to some good. 
only recommentation we can have; But really
I look to see one who knows neither 
reckon to recommend him.  seeing 
not how much he has done so read, but how
much he is.

I pretend I was talking Creek,
when I fearst saw you it looked to 
friends, but you all understood 
Creek, is this really so unintelligible?
