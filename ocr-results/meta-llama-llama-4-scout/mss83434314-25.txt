It sometimes happens—as, for instance, during the temporary absence of the Commander of a department, &c.—that a copy of a letter is received for record in the book, several days after its date, and after one or more letters of subsequent date have been recorded. In such a case it will be copied in the book in the usual way, but a note (in red ink) will be made—between the letter dated immediately prior to the communication in question and the one written next after it in point of date—giving the number of the letter and the page on which it is recorded

3. Each letter should be signed in the record book by its writer.

4. Whenever copies of letters are furnished, the names of the persons to whom they are sent, should be noted in red ink in the margin, with the date, when the last differs from the date of the letter itself (See example in first paragraph.) In like manner, when a letter is addressed to an officer, under cover to his commander, &c., this fact should also be noted. (See example below.)
