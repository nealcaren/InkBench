My dear Steadly,

I have to thank you for his
letters and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs. Blum. I thank you especially for the clippings 
for as you suspect, I am interested
in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention, Miss Bliss brought 
a letter she had recd from Effie Taruce,
and she had described very vividly how
and she had been able to rise above her 
sufferings thro' Christian Science. Lencie's
lips from  as she read it, and she was no 

great admirer of Mrs. B. I helin she has 
me that E. Taruce was also estid 
exled in Ch Sci. Mrs. B. was most 
gracious and forgiving  - 
met, and altho she also has fresh of vio, she was
of character, as wel so the a woman 
to be admired for very many 
estimable qualities.
