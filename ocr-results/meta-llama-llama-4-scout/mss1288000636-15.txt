Nampa back on the farms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets. During recent months it has become apparent that state control in marketing of out-of-state milk is imported in volume was not enough.

Despite the fact that efficient operation of federal and state control agencies, working in cooperation, is likely to lessen somewhat the need for producer associations, there should be no worry lest the control agencies would put the cooperatives out of business. Control administrators have publicly stated that farmer associations were essential for the smooth operation of the dairy industry.

It now appears that the revised Boston milk marketing agreement being written under AAA auspices, may never reach a final, acceptable form. The various parties to the agreement seem determined that they shall not be forced to concede an inch. In view of the fact that Administrator Samuel W. Tator has reminded New England that the agreement is purely voluntary and that he will eventually tire in his efforts to secure the agreement, such tactics are foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow

Seven Germans were sentenced to prison the other day for listening to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two of them having their sentences lengthened to four years for the additional offense of discussing politics while the broadcast was going on.

To most people who have ever happened to "pick up Moscow" this will seem a high price to pay for either the instruction or the entertainment offered. But the same would be true of broadcasts from Berlin or Rome whenever these desert Mozart and Verdi for the arid wastes of propaganda.

Whether Russians are being sent to jail for tuning in on the fuehrer, or the duce, has not been reported, but it is hard to imagine any government being put in danger by the dreary stuff that is being broadcast in prodigious quantities for consumption abroad. It would save all the dictators much trouble simply to let the broadcasts cancel out, assuming, for example, that Russians do no more damage in Germany than German broadcasts are doing in Russia.

American and French Bombing Planes

The description of 24 French bombing planes now being hurried to completion near Paris and Washington that "suasion of business men" may time lead the government to lay an embargo on trade with Italy. If there is to be an embargo, that is not a very inspiring kind of suasion in its being half.

It is suggested in a dispatch from IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION

To the Editor of The Republican:-

If the subject were not so tragic, one might be amused at the futile and almost frantic efforts of nations which are constantly being forged in the attempt to reduce the number of automobile fatalities.

PATRIOTISM

To the Editor of The Republican:-

Flag waving and lip service denote no patriotism. The American people have given the lie to this cynical slur, but much support for the national prestige theory of taste can be found in current fashions. It would be hard to trace any connection between increased prestige of the Soviet rep- 
lic, for example, and the lively, considerable interest in imported goods, from blouses up and down, but not quite down to safety matches.

Soviet matches have improved, even now the best to be said for them is that they are more likely to be than if the box said "made in Japan" on it. The best that can be said for Japan matches is that their production showed positive genius in discovering that by coloring their wrappers they could ship to the United States as fancy ornamental matches with a lot more to pay.

That the prestige of the Sov- 
iet masters' touch, the sculptor's chisel keen.

Great Master, touch us with thy skill- 
ful hand;
Let not the music that is in us die!

Hidden and lost, thy form within 
lie!

Spare not the stroke! Do with us as 
Thou wilt!

Thou wilt?
Let there be naught unfinished, broke- 
en, marred;
Complete the purpose, that we may 
become

The perfect image, O our God and 
Lord!

The Master's touch, the sculptor's 
beauty hides un-

In the rough marble beauty un-

From A Former Resident

To the Editor of The Republican:-

Very few cities have the natural advantages which the City of Homes has - geographically situated to be a manufacturing and distributing center, beautifully located on the large estuaries with its salt water and various large eastern cities.

To add to these superb collection of school systems, in which eastern and other features combine to make our city most productive homes, and other feature that should make possible this channel develop these, there are no doubt some impediments to realize that we provide for production of these machines, yet we require for nearly all who operator's licenses for nearly all who
