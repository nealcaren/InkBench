THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.
Some Iowa newspapers carry the erroneous impression that the special law enforcement agents are appointed by the attorney general. These special officers are named by the governor. If Iowa should elect a "liberal" governor he probably would have "liberal" special agents. - Sioux City Tribune.

MR. IRISH GROWING OLD.
Nothing is sadder in this world than the change that comes over so many men as they shift from the buoyant enthusiasm of youth to the view-with-alarm despondency of age. We do not know of an illustration more to the point than the speeches John P. Irish is now making in Iowa against woman suffrage when contrasted with the speeches he made in the Iowa legislature four woman suffrage.

John P. Irish was a forward looking man in the old days when with spontaneous eloquence he pleaded for equal rights. Now he is as solemnly alarmed as any other pessimist. It is really too bad that so many esteem[ed] people begin to see every[thing] in the first line that he is "an American citizen," in the next eulogizes England, and in the last subscribes himself in lieu of his name, "A Gladstonian Liberal." Evidently he used this expression to conceal his German ancestry. What would we think of the state of his hyphen had he signed himself "A Follower of Bismarck?"

Third in the column is a letter entitled "Mawkish America". Its author declares that this country is "hysterically feminine and neurotic," and he signs himself "Anglicus." His hyphen is evidently severely inflamed.

Immediately following is the critical judgment of Mr. James McDonald, who says: "I consider the British empire the freest and best government in the world." Well, why not go home, then?

And the column winds up with an article on the "mongrel population" of the United States, ending: "Bah! my country, 'tis of thee."

James Macpherson, "Trenton, N. J."

Just suppose that name had been Wilhelm Lutasenscheck!

All of these letters appeared in one column of the New York Tribune, and they appeared there consecutively. Not one has been omitted. Shall we continue to think of the hyphen solely in Teutonic terms?

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.
The Register recently asked of the Chicago Tribune "why did not Washington and Madison and Jefferson and Hamilton and the constitution makers meet the situation and give this country an army and a navy at the start?"

The Tribune comes back with the claim that these men would have given us a military establishment but a blind congress would not listen to them. The Tribune quotes a number of familiar passages from Washington, and then jumps to the conclusion that our school histories ought to be rewritten to show the military purposes of the fathers.

It is not worth while to quibble with the Tribune, but it is worth while to get at the real point of view of the men who started this nation out, in a military age, without a military fitting, in the belief that a great, peaceable, industrial democracy could be built in this new land free from the follies and blunders that had wrecked every earlier attempt at human organization.

The Register will not go to the school histories, but will go to Alexander Hamilton, because of all the men named "Hamilton leaned most to adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little if any inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms."

The constitution was accepted on this presentation by Hamilton, but the fathers were not wholly satisfied and in the amendments constituting the American bill of rights, the militia was officially recognized as the military defense of the new nation, and every man was protected in the private right to bear arms in order that at no later date might a mistaken congress order or maintain a regular army to overturn or popular liberties.

When the war of 1812 was impending Randolph in an impassioned speech in congress said, "I will forever stand up for the militia. It is not in the scoffs of the opullete gentry to degrade them in my eyes. Who are they? Ourselves - the country. Arm them and you are safe, beyond the possibility of danger. It is a fundamental principle of free government that a legislature that would preserve its liberty must avoid that canker, a standing army. Are we to forget as chimerical our notions of this institution which we imbibed from our very cradles, which are imprinted on our bill of rights and constitutions, which we avowed under the reign of John Adams?"

And Madison in his message to congress in that year, referring to a refusal of some of the states to furnish militia men for the war showed conclusively in what regard the standing army was held when he said that in a failure of the militia "the public safety may have no other resource than in those large and permanent military establishments which are forbidden by the principles of our free government, and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark."

Nor was this a sentiment confined to the colonies and the young republic. Ambrose Clement writing in Lalor's "Encyclopedia of Political Science" says, "A very able German author, Mr. Rotteck, published in 1816 an important work entitled 'Standing Armies and National Militia.' He proves from the history of all wars, from those of the most ancient peoples down to the termination of the war of 1815, that standing armies or paid troops, under the sole con-

When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage

In the legislative session of 1870 an amendment proposing woman suffrage was passed by both houses of the Iowa legislature, and passed the house in the session of 1872. It was defeated in the senate of 1872 and so the amendment was not submitted to popular vote. John P. Irish engineered the amendment through the house both in 1870 and 1872. John A. Kasson was member from Polk and he voted for the amendment at both sessions.

This amendment was far-reaching and read as follows:

Laws of Iowa, 1870: 252. Joint Resolution No. 14. Joint resolution proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa, and to provide for its reference and publication.

Be it resolved by the general assembly of the state of Iowa, That the following amendments to the constitution of the state of Iowa, be and are hereby proposed:

1. Strike from section 1 of article 11 of said constitution, the word "male".

2. Strike from section 4 of article 11 of said constitution, the word "male".

Resolved further, That these resolutions proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa are hereby referred to the legislature to be chosen at the next general election; and that the secretary of state shall cause the same to be published for three months previous to the time of the next general election of members of the legislature in one newspaper in each congressional district. Approved April 4, 1870.

WHAT MR. IRISH SAID.

Legislative supplement, session of 1870, March 29, 1870: Mr. Irish - It is to be expected that I, as the member who introduced this resolution, out of which the joint resolution is moved, should say something on the question before the house. Let us view it, if you choose, in the light of an experiment at whose inception we stand today. Let us leave the poetry of the proposition out of the question, for the poetry of the proposition has been given in its most eloquent manner by the gentleman from Scott (Mr. Green). Let us view it in the light of fact; look at it in its present shape and see if there is any actual strength in the proposition. Gentlemen who may object to the passage of this joint resolution cannot object thereto because it has not been demanded by the class proposed to be affected by it. The best and the most talented women of our land - those who during the late war showed their love of country by works which were not less laborious than those performed by the soldier in the field - women, representing the most enlightened and highly educated of their sex, have organized movements all over the land in favor of the things which we contemplate today. They demand it; they pray for it; they work for it; they speak for it. Perhaps this may be to their disgrace. Perhaps they are degrading themselves by so doing. There are many who agree with the gentle-

privilege of obtaining education, or you must take a step forward. You must proceed to the legal result and that no follow th opening of the universities which have given birth in the midst of women to these aspirations which education ever brings to those who possess it. We are at the inception of the question. How can the experiment be demonstrated a disaster? How can the family, found which we should throw every safeguard, suffer by the prosecution of this experiment? For who has a warmer, or a more heartfelt interest in the maintenance of the family, in all its purity and goodness, than woman has? When woman is convinced that the family, in its organization, must suffer by this experiment, will you tell me that she will not be the first to recede from this position? I am willing to leave the matter in her hands, and if the family is to suffer or be degraded, I know she will abandon the prosecution of a dangerous experiment.

IN A SECOND SPEECH.
Mr. Irish - I am requested by the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Ball) to read certain parts of the holy scripture. They are the Corinthians, fourteenth chapter, thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth verses: Epistle of Paul to Timothy, eleventh and twelfth verses. If I were competent to do so before this legislature, I would move an amendment to those passages. (Laughter.) But as that is not competent, I would say, in explanation, that Paul was then speaking to the Corinthians whom I do not know what sort they were. They may have been utterly unqualified to speak in public, and it might have been proper that Paul should exhort them to keep silence in churches. He said nothing of the American women that they should keep silence at the polls or legislature. Paul claimed inspiration; but it is singular that nowhere in the writing of his divine master do you find such sentiments expressed. Jesus, in the most sublime of all his sayings, in his sermon on the mount, exalted men and women to deeds of charity, to be merely walk with their God. This book teaches that men and women should alike endure trial and suffer judgments of the law, should alike die and arise at the resurrection. As they are to travel side by side spiritually, does it seem wise that we should place women in a temporary position of disadvantage, where their ambition is to be unsatisfied, where her aspirations are never to be realized? If we can make her live better, and more wisely she would we not do it?

In doing that, we are obeying the spirit of the scripture. I care not what might have been said by Paul or any other apostle, who was so unfortunate as to live and die a bachelor. It is better to refer to the writings of the divine master and not to the teachings of one who was a little bit headstrong and pedantic in his views and manner of expression. The gentleman from Dubuque (Mr. O'Donnell) has ably spoken on the other side of
