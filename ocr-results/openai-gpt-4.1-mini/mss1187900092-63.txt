My Dear Sir,
                         I saw lof here yesterday
on my way I read your speech, & though I
heard you with pleasure declining it, I
had more impressed with it as I read it;
last night I read it to my father; he
was much pleased & united with me
in pronouncing it able.  You should
decline it throughout the country, it will
do great good.-
                                                                    Yours truly
                                                                          W. B. Smith
