Grandpa was never called "Lloyd"
He was first Frederick Bailey, the slave
Changed to Johnson when he ran
away, and because the man in
whose home he lived in New Bedford
Mass. was named Johnson, this man
who had just finished reading
"The Lord of the Lake" admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglass" asked
Grandpa - to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, he would
like to call himself
Douglass instead of Johnson!
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another and hence-
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass.
This are facts - not hearsay.

Later - Just rec'd. letter from Fred - he
leaves on his "debating tour" today -
and really debates at Howard.  He
will stop with or a l[?]v already written
Joe's wife & Mannie and sent Crawford.
