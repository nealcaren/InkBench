My dear Mrs Blackwell

Thank you very much indeed for your most kind permission to me to set some of the verses of your translation of "La Palmera" to music.

I found the translation so appealing & beautiful that music to it would float into my head, & at last I was tempted to make a very simple little song out of three or four of the verses, just for our private use. Then, as our friends seemed to like it, my sister-in-law offered to write to you, in case it might be published.

I should most certainly give myself the great pleasure
