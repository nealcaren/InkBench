sentimentalisms?  On what could the Kenneth Rayners, & the members of the press expend their eloquence?

If we press Mrs. Miller & her steamboat, Mr. Douglass & his wife into the compass of a syllogism, & prove logically that "United States citizens" have a right to choose their own votes & employments, half the nitiring & speaking in this country as to class privileges might be ended.  I hail the day when in the discussion of human rights exact & equal justice will be demanded of & for all without distinction of race or sex.
With my kind regards to your wife, & my best wishes for your happiness.
Very sincerely yours
Elizabeth Lady Bluntton
