feel that I am growing old,
am not now what I have
been - although time has
been quite generous with
me - you will see by
this letter that it hardens
for me to write now than
in old times when my
nervousness was steady
and strong - give my
kind regards to your
wife in which my good Ruth
partly joins.  Excuse this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend and well-wisher
James N. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see 
us. I say Amen. You have
now an engagement not 
fulfilled     J.N.B
