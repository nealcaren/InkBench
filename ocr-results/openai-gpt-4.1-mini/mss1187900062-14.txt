ALBERT E. WALKER,  
COUNSELOR AT LAW,  
(Including Patent Causes.)

Hartford, Connecticut,

4th If the colored leaders take
to denouncing the Supreme Court,
they will alienate the sympathies
of their best friends in the North.
The abolition of slavery; the
prohibition of discriminating
Ostraclaw; the exclusion of
the ballot to the colored man: 
these are secure.  If the colored
leaders denounce anybody for
not also punishing by law, the
unauthorized and assumed exclusion
of colored people from
particular private prosperity,
such as hotels & theaters it
will look rather childish.  It
will tend to show that the colored
people care more for the show
than for the substance of citizenship.
