Mch 26. 1923.

My dear Mollie:  -
                I gave you the place for a
cable and none is here.  We remain
another day but I suspect that progress
is in the direction of recovery and that you
have not cabled at all.
Mch 27.  I was interrupted here and now every-
thing is different and twice has passed
your cable has been received, and it was such
a relief to get it.  I imagine you passing through
that discouraging stage when you think you
never will be well again and when life has
lost all its fervor.  Nat. keep up your courage
and you'll pull through.  I am so glad
you are better.  This world must be a
black old place mistook you dear Mollie.
    I expected to mail you a note here

cable first it would be a good mail
station, but it seems many American
