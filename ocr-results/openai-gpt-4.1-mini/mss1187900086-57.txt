My dear Bassett,
Soon after your previous excellent letter, and before I could see him about the consulship to St. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, without note or warning departed from Washington for Bar Harbor, where he now is and is as-
pected to remain till October; at least so say the papers. He evidently found the climate of Washington at this season, combined with the pressure of the office seeking too much for him.
In my last interview with him, I was con-
vinced that nine toil, and anxiety, had made inroads upon his heart and constitution, and that he must either take rest, or rest would take him. For this, and other reason knowing that a personal interview with him would be far better for no man writing to him, I have not mentioned the Dr. Thomas proposal to him as yet.  The President, too, is so much out of the city, going so often and staying so briefly in the city, and giving his time so exclusively when here to the members of his Cabinet, that I have been unable to see him since Mr. Blaine left.
It is understood here that no Consular 
appointments will now be made in the absence of Secretary Blaine, hence no progress
