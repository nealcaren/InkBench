Bridport Dorsetshire
October 9th 1866

My dear Mr. [Dorsfass?]

On our return from our three-months' tour through France Italy & Switzerland we spent a few days at Woodcote (Brighton) before reaching Bridport at the beginning of July, and there we found your kind & welcome letters awaiting us.  It is always a great pleasure to receive one of your nice long letters, & this one (dashed May 31st) was as usual full of interest.  
I trust you will have us may such adventures as the one you describe as having taken place in Baltimore last Winter.  It was a mercy that you escaped uninjured.  But you might not be so fortunate another time, so do be prudent, as to where & how you travel, and remember how very valuable
