Dear Fredrick Douglass

When we first saw your appointment to Hoyt - and also how many kind and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you I began to clip and stick them with the intention of sending them all on to you - I cut “lotts” of them.  but alas! in the huge files of editorial scraps they have all disappeared but three I enclose-
It was pleasant to see the appreciation in which you are held while you are alive to see it.
I am not sure that we are glad to have you go. - We need you here.
