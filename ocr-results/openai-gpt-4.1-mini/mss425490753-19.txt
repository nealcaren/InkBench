RUTH MCCORMICK, DENEEN SOUND CAMPAIGN CRIES
Senator Attacks County Administration.

BY PARKE BROWN. —
Both United States Senator Deneen and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, who has announced her candidacy against him, manifested yesterday what was construed as a desire to see the actual campaign started, although each has chosen the first week in January for the opening of real hostilities.

Senator Deneen addressed more than 100 of his followers—Chicago ward committeemen, county town precinct committeemen, and officeholders—at a luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It was a closed meeting, but later the senator made public part of his speech, a criticism of the condition existing in the local governments.

Mrs. McCormick, just before leaving for Washington on an afternoon train, issued a statement charging that a “propaganda factory” is circulating false yarns that she is not a bona fide candidate. She said that not only does she intend to remain in the race, but also she expects to win the nomination.

Deneen Raps County Rule.
“Since the election of 1928,” read Senator Deneen’s manuscript, “every week has revealed in some measure the character of the misfeasance, nonfeasance, or malfeasance by certain public officials in this county.

“The people have been deceived, hoodwinked, and in part have permitted unworthy prejudice to influence their votes. In part they have been influenced by small favors to them against the law and the general good, and in a degree by the cohesive power of public plunder.

“I say the people have permitted unworthy motives to influence their votes by tolerating the breakdown of law and order and economical and efficient government in our local political administration.

“The economic laws have moved slowly but mightily against the conduct of public officials and the lethargy of the public itself.

Penalty of Bankruptcy.
“The bankruptcy in the character of public officials which has been approved or tolerated by our people is now followed by bankruptcy in almost every department of government. The economic laws are as remorseless as the natural laws, and we will all soon pay the penalty of what we have approved or tolerated in our local government.

“We are to pay for it in high taxes; enormous interest on borrowed funds to conduct the government day by day; impaired police and fire protection and the lack of cleanliness in our city; in the public health, the poor and the sick must suffer, and the children and the youth of the city must be de-

in the past was theirs by mere dint of birth.

“Have I overstated conditions in our community? Political conditions brought about these results, but deferred penalties are personal and affect our community as a whole.

“There will be no need to state political conditions or create issues in the coming primaries. Every one knows the facts. The contest will relate to the personality of the candidates, their ability and experience and character. They will be judged by their intelligence, initiative, energy and sense of public service. Our duty is plain enough.

Senator Condemns Prejudice.
“In this great campaign let us emphasize that those who appeal to the prejudices of our citizens for votes and those citizens who permit their prejudices to determine their votes who are equally unworthy and merit public condemnation.

“The task of equalizing the burdens of government and restoring government to its proper functions calls for the best judgment of our citizens.

“Let those who vote for illegal favors and for hire, and those who grant illegal favors and pay bribes be exposed as the enemies of the government and of the people.”

Senator Deneen—outside his manuscript—also told his followers that his group has made no deal on a county ticket with any other faction or any Republican leader outside its own fold.

Mrs. McCormick’s Statement.
The statement of Mrs. McCormick read as follows:

“Reports recently circulated in Illinois by my political opponents are intended to confuse the public as to the senatorial situation.


that I am going to withdraw from the race for the United States senatorship. The Republicans of the state have been asked to believe that I have made a deal whereby I will withdraw from the present contest and make the race two years hence.

“These and other false reports have been spread over the state with such persistent energy that they at least do credit to the industry of the propaganda factory that is sending them out. It appears that in making these predictions the wish has been father to the thought.

She’s in Senate Race.
“I want to say emphatically now that I am in the race for the Republican nomination for United States senator and that I shall be in the race every minute up to the closing of the polls on April 8, 1930.

“I traveled 34,000 miles in the state of Illinois in 1927 and 1938 in my campaign for Congress and visited every county in the state. I am going to make an even more vigorous campaign for the senate. I have established state headquarters on the seventeenth floor of the London Guaranty and Accident building, 360 North Michigan avenue.

“I am returning to Washington today to attend the sessions of the annual rivers and harbors congress and to continue my regular duties in the house of representatives. I plan to start my speaking campaign immediately on my return from Washington on Jan. 6; and my time thereafter will be so divided that my work in Illinois will require a minimum of interruption of my duties in congress.

“I not only propose to press my campaign vigorously but I expect to be nominated on April 8, 1930.”

Announces G. O. P. Meeting.
B. W. Snow, vice campaign of the Republican county central committee, announced that the committee will be called into session next Friday after-

noon to tackle the task of reorganization made possibly by the withdrawals of former Chairman Homer K. Galpin and Robert E. Crowe, former state’s attorney. The meeting probably will be held in the Hotel La Salle at 3 o’clock.

Among the speakers at a testimonial dinner to Judge Marcus Kavanagh at the Congress hotel tonight are list-ed Charles S. Whittman, former governor of New York; the Rev. John Cavanagh, president emeritus of Notre Dame university; Brig. Gen. Milton J. Foreman, James Hamilton Lewis and Silas H. Strawn.

WIFE DIVORCES MORSE IN RENO; HE LOSES PLEA

Reno, Nev., Dec. 9.—[Special.]—
Jared Kirtland Morse of the chemistry department, University of Chicago, and former architect of New York, today lost a divorce action he instituted a week ago when his wife, Eleanor Chapin Morse, was awarded the decree.

The decree was allowed Mrs. Morse upon her deposition alleging that he had deserted her during an illness. Mrs. Morse was awarded $4,500 a year alimony for herself and an adopted child, 17 years of age, now in her custody. They were married at Rochester, N.Y., in July, 1910.

In his complaint Morse alleged his wife had been a hindrance to his ambition to study scientific research, and that when he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago, she came to live with him, but continually nagged him. Mrs. Morse denied his allegations.
