Boston Dec: 25th

My dear Miss Dickinson

Your favor of the 19th containing a Cheque for five Hundred dollars - came safely to hand:

And I should have acknowledged its receipt at once: but it out-pounds both Leavie and myself to ill to do even so little: we are now better and hope to continue so: at all events we shall try.  Many thanks for your favor -

Leavie sends much love to you & your Mother

Ever yours truly
Wm Hzuckett
