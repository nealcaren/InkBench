Dear Mrs. Brown:  

I can't let your note about Miss Blackwell go unanswered, even if the checks I would like to send must be omitted.  

I have always admired Miss Blackwell, and, in late years, have loved her especially.  Her always beautiful Christmas and Easter messages, and her indomitable spiritual grace are such lovely additions to the great background of her life work.  

It wrings my heart to know that she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.  There are so many who are!  I am one of them myself, or of course I would share in making the fund which you are raising.  Being a starving artist is a most painful handicap, in every way, but it is particularly hard to endure, when appeals like this come.  

Thank you for including me as one of her friends. - Which I most heartily am.  

Sincerely,  
Mary Ware Dennett
