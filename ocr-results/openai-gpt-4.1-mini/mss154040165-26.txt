Captains instructions and some Dennison craft paper describing the two varieties. She didn't get anything 
My letter to Chin Cam.  Districts definitely stated they coved from the Instructions at $3 for 100. Just why anyone in that office shouldn't know crepe paper is a mystery.  I should think they might think the campaign covered mostly of paper designs. 
The result is that Rochester didn't get its headquarters decorated for May 2. and the Captains gathered for my Conference cannot take the decorations home with them. That is a long way from efficiency. Please see what is the matter and who doesn't know crepe paper.  I could scarcely believe her.
