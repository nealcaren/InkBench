Friday Mar 8

My dear friend,

Words from between
I went to M—— because I
understood you were to
be there at just that time
but I could not have
met you.  I was sick.
For was Mrs L. I was very
much "disappointed" too
but so glad you & mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
I do take all care of my
self for that future is in
hope but this weather kills
me if it was one long summer
