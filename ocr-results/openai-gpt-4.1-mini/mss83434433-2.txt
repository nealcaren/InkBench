Dear Sir

I have thought of an expedient to bring in Caroline which I submit to you. It is this, Genl Moseby is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi Now if you could dispense with Janet & see Genl LL & let her go & stay his negroes & get it out that he has bought her it would I am sure bring her in & Let it be out that it is an arrangement of mine over which you have no control; What do you think of it? Let me know.

Yrs truly
John H. Lewis
