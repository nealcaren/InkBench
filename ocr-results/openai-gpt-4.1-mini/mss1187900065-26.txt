Dear Sir
Yesterday deposited with the Surrogate of Hudson Co., N.Jersey, the Will of the late Ottila Assing, along with a letter from me declining to serve as Executor, copies of which I forward to you with this.

You will please take such action in
the matter of supplying a substitute, as you deem proper, and believe me

Yours with great respect
