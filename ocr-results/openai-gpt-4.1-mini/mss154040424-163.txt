Six years; six years to observe the infirmities of American politics,
you have had, women of America.  Will you allow any power whatsoever to steal
from you the significance of the vote you struggled so long to win?  My
suggestion is probably impractical.  The only thing certainly right about
it is the proposal of rebellion.  No wrong was ever righted by obedience
to those who have sponsored that wrong.  Wrong was ever righted by rebellion
against those who stand for that wrong.  It think it over, pray, think again.
Keep on thinking.  You will find a way.  When you have it, arise, put aside
your ease, your soft indulgencies.  There is work for you.  The primaries
need reforming, the parties need renovating and all politics need disinfecting.
Is it true that you women have no influence as regulars, as standpatters?
Then try the path of rebellion and blaze a new trail to decency and honor
for your party and your nation.  You can have influence if you will.  Yes,
a hundred fold more influence than the Pennsylvania statesman has now.

But you can only win through rebellion.  The times call for the fighting
spirit of the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence.  You have
influence whenever you are ready to fight for it.  When that time comes,
you women will not fight alone.  There will be plenty of splendid, big-
souled American men to fight by your side.  Do not forget that they are many-
the men who bore the humiliation of being so-called rubber stamps before you
were enfranchised.  There is no doubt of the need of a rebellion nor
of the few at home who are if one is started on a clear
high principled plane from how it were doubt what the COME! 

"It's great to be out where the fight is strong
    To be where the heaviest troops belong
    And to fight there for man and God."

perhaps we’ll curse you when it is in progress.
Never fear, they will call you blessed when
it is over the men and women who brought ... shall be the
stars and bars of this country.
