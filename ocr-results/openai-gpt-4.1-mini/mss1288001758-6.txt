that may do for Summer -
Just this moment comes the letter say with your letter
thank you very dear & sympathy with the song
you feel at Mr Swanson's decline.  But all
things work together for good
to so good souls as yours.  So Harry dear never mind.
There must be something good
for you somewhere.  Because you deserve it.  I am glad
the children are as good as
nice pie, I hope they will
keep so.  Tell Mary I want
to have drive on the butter -
Please look, and see if there
is any - Love to mother & all - But most to you.
aff. Fini
