Excellency, that I shall never cease to appreciate the honor conferred upon me by making me a Commissioner to the World's Columbian Exposition, and while I have to confess that Haiti's participation in that demonstration of civilization was at great cost, far greater than I would have had it, could I have controlled the business of the Commission, I still think that Haiti did by no means, present an insignificant figure among the nations there assembled.

I have no regrets that the settlement of the affairs of the Commission, was placed in the able and careful hands of Mr. Haentjens, the Haitian Minister.

With great respect and esteem I dare to subscribe myself,
Your sincere and constant friend,
