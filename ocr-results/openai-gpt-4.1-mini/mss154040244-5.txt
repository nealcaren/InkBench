Few to tell her about
the League's round face!

We are meeting tomorrow
to come to definite
conclusions about the
design, inscription, etc.,
for the memorial tablet
in Washington on which
the National Honor Roll
names are to be placed.
We plan to hear the
unveiling take place at
the time of our Council
meeting in Washington in April.

With gratitude - & my
love, believe me,
always affectionately yours
Katharine Ludington
