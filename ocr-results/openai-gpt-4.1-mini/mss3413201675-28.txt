TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double
By ELEANOR ROBERTS
There are so many guest shot "swaps" on television next season that viewers will think they're seeing double.
Searching back in your memory you'll be saying, "Now, WHERE did I see Bing Crosby--on the Bob Hope show or on his own special?"
SINATRA SWAPPING; SHOTS WITH MARTIN
Frankie Sinatra is swapping guest shots with Dean Martin who, in turn, will return the courtesy on the Sinatra special. And Milton Berle is not only involved with Danny Thomas who'll make a return appearance on Uncle Miltie's special but he's doing a swap with Lucy-Desi, too.

DINAH SHORE
Speaking of the stars' solid billing, Dean Martin is booked clear into 1962!
DINAH SHORE'S new wardrobe should really be an eye-opener. She's been picking up glamorous gowns from famous couturiers in every country she has visited on her European tour.
Dinah stopped off with husband George Montgomery and daughter Melissa in Israel and bought a beautiful gown in Tel Aviv. Leon Uris' best-seller "Exodus" inspired her visit to Israel where she was a guest of the government.
Breats there a comedian with so sad a dead that he doesn't yearn to be a dramatic star? Apparently not, with so many of them - Ed Wynn, Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason, - dreaming a whack at straight - talk.
The newest one to join the circle is comedian GEORGE GOBEL who'll star in his first straight dramatic role on TV in General Electric Theatre's "They Like Me Fine", next season.
Gobel plays the role of a small-time night club comic who gets his biggest laughs from members of his family. Very Pagliacci! George's own alternate-week show kicks off Sunday, Oct. 11, Ch. 7, 10:30.
MUST BE THE NEW HARDRO on what gives with Hermione Gingold who looked so different on the video-taped "I've Got A Secret". Wednesday night? Positively years younger and quite attractive in a sleek, too-too sort of way.
She even locked glamour-touched on the JACK PAAR show when she helped him celebrate his anniversary with Dodie Goodman and Genevieve, not long ago.
A NEWT HIGH PRICE TAGS, the word is around that Ingrid Bergman will get $100,000 for "Turn of the Screw". And the figure being given out on NBC-TV's expenditure for specials alone is staggering---$57,000,000.
Turns out that HARRY BELAFONTE who thought he could
Welk, Gisele MacKenzie and Phil Harris will cavort with the Schnozzola, instead, on his Sept. 25 spec.
Whew, the mad dash for talent is really at its peak. Producer David Suskind is after ANTHONY QUINN to play the title role of Don Quixote in his upcoming Du Pont Show of the Month "The Man Who Was Don Quixote."
It's a free adaptation of the famous Don Quixote story that includes incidents from the life of Miguel de Cervantes, author of the novel. Suskind has his eye on Mexico's top comedy star, Cantinflas, to play Don Quixote's squire, Sancho Panza.
"BACHELOR FATHER" fans will see their hero in a TV role that, at last, does justice to his dramatic ability. He'll play Sammy's (Larry Blyden's) discoverer in "What Makes Sammy Run?"
The JOHNNY STATCATO series (more jazz and more slinky private-eye stuff) may be changed to just "Staccato." Seems the opposing CBS-TV show is "Johnny Ringo" and would it be a pity if NBC viewers got the wrong Johnny?
Pick Of The Weekend
All-Star Football Tops Tonight*
Tonight By DICK KLEINER
BEST BET - Smack in the middle of August, we've got ourselves the first football game of the season tonight. This is the annual kick-off of the kick-off season. THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME from Chicago's Soldier Field. Each year, the cream of last season's graduating collegians meet the pro champs, in this case the Baltimore Colts. As usual, it should be a passing contest, with the Colts' John Unitas and the All-Stars' Lee Grosscup (who'll play pro this year with the New York Giants) matching tosses. This is always a colorful game, with bands and half-time formalities and players passing out from the heat. 9:30 (Ch. 5).
7:30-8:30 (Ch. 7) - RAWHIDE retraces its steps back to the spot on the trail where everybody started dropping from poisoned foot. Seems a pack of high IQ rustlers dosed the vittles with powdered coyote weed, a lethal seasoning. The object of their black game was to kill off the whole crew so they could swipe the cattle. They reckon without Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood.
9:30 (Ch. 7) - The plot for tonight's PHIL SILVERS SHOW repeat has an "Annie Get Your Gun" flavor. There's a sharp shooting contest and, after one thing and another, Bilko takes his healthy wad on a WOC who promptly falls in love - and you can't get a man with a gun. Peggy Cass has a ball as the deadeye dame.
9:30-10 (Ch. 7) - STRIPE PLAYHOUSE, is repeating at Schlitz Playhouse original which is a solid detective story. It's a tricky murder tale called "No Answer," with Keenan Wynn the super-sleuth and Donald Cook the prime suspect. He seems to have an airtight alibi for the murder of the beautiful young thing - the with Wynn when it happened.
9:30 - THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME (See Best Bet)
Saturday
BEST BET - THE PERRY PRESENTS gimmick - the almanac - is gradually being eased out of the show. And, more and more, the singers simply do good songs without any attempt to tie them in to events of the past. Tonight, Tony Bennett sings "Strike Up the Band" and Jaye P. Morgan does "Music, Maestro, Please" in that uncomforted way. And there's a medley of some all-time record hits which has no almanac significance. During this spot. Tony will sing "Cry," Jaye P. does "Daddy," The Modernaires have "This My Desire" and there'll be a dancing production number to "One O'Clock Jump."   8-9 (Ch. 4).
7:38 (Ch. 5) - If your seismograph is registering some tremors on the West Coast, it's probably because THE DICK CLARK SHOW is getting ready to do three shows there. Before they left New York, they taped the one you'll see tonight. Jack Scott is the biggest name, with Tommy Edwards, Rusty York, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Browns the other guests.
8-9 PERRY PRESENTS (See best bet).
9:30 (Ch. 7) - BRENNER continues to find new approaches for a police show. Tonight's tells of a social worker and a policeman, who have differing attitudes about juvenile crime. Since Lee Grant is the social worker and Edward Binns is the policeman, both these views are believable and we'll presented. Binns and Miss Grant, who have worked together before, make a good team.
10:30-11 (Ch. 5) - THE D.A.'s MAN is repeating one of its better jobs, in which you'll meet a real nasty type. This is one

6:30 (Ch. 2) - An excellent guided tour of the U.S. is provided by CHET HUNTLEY REPORTING, but there's a larger purpose. It's a suggested itinerary for Premier Khrushchev on his visit here and includes visits to wheat and corn fields in Iowa, to look at an integrated community in Levittown, Pa., a thinking machine center in Cambridge, Mass., New York City, the Oklahoma oil wells, and thence to California for an illustration of how a desert was converted into a lush valley.
8-9 (Ch. 7) - It's business as usual on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW even though the headman is off in Russia looking for Soviet sword-swallowers. This was taped last June and features Lionel Hampton and a small group in some feverish jazz. Jan Pearce, the Metropolitan Opera lad who also
