all this to acquire necessary experience & to be 
governed by those I would help, that I fully know
their trouble & could not but make common cause
with them - If so it is but a blasphemy in disguise!

And now let me add that on Easter eve I
was sought Mr. Faur√© by the Director of Fleure Institute
mentioned in annexed paper - to tell me he had
proof that "Philanthropic money" as he called it could
be found in the North (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for such such work as I had hinted
& to which he added the my questions mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 4, Page 1 of the
Daily Intell[igenc]er of 25 March Chicago giving an account
of a successful colored colonization at Tuskagee
Alabama - to which I refer you also as mine to interest
you - It was a number of 62 pages printed at
immense no of copies as its 21st anniversary which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair - When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion & counsel how best to proceed

I feel one of your sympathy for the cause
perhaps "for auld lang syne" so remain, hopefully
& with very best wishes of the reason for your
continued prosperity Dear Sir
                       most truly yours
                       F. S. Guthrie d'Atrusmont
