Honorable  
F. H. Douglass,  
Washington, D.C.  

Dear Mr. Douglass:  

I read your speech delivered on the occasion commemorative of Emancipation in the District of Columbia and was particularly edified and pleased by your utterances, and surprised at the vigor and brilliancy of your powers after an almost constant experience of stress for nearly a half century in the cause of our oppressed people.
