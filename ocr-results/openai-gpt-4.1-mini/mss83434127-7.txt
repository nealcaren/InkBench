I was dying to prefer my request that he would purchase Psyche and her children, and so prevent any future separation between her and her husband, as I supposed he would not again attempt to make a present of Joe, at least to any one who did not wish to be bothered with his wife and children.  In the evening I was again with Mr. O—— alone in the strange, bare, wooden-walled sort of shanty which is our sitting-room, and revolving in my mind the means of rescuing Psyche from her miserable suspense, a long chain of all my possessions, in the shape of bracelets, necklaces, brooches, earrings, etc., wound in glittering procession through my brain, with many hypothetical calculations of the value of each separate ornament, and the very doubtful probability of the amount of the whole being equal to the price of this poor creature and her children; and then the great power and privilege I had foregone of earning money by my own labor occurred to me, and I think, for the first time in my life, my past profession assumed an aspect that arrested my thoughts most seriously.  For the last four years of my life that preceded my marriage I literally coined money, and never until this moment, I think, did I reflect on the great means of good, to myself and others, that I so gladly agreed to give up forever for a maintenance by the unpaid labor of slaves–people toiling not only unpaid, but under the bitter conditions the bare contemplation of which was then wringing my heart.  You will not wonder that when, in the midst of such cogitations, I suddenly accosted Mr. O——, it was to this effect: “Mr. O——, I have a particular favor to beg of you.  Promise me that you will never sell Psyche and her children without first letting me know of your intention to do so, and giving me the option of buying them.”  Mr. O—— is a remarkably deliberate man, and squints, so that, when he has taken a little time in directing his eyes to you, you are still unpleasantly unaware of any result in which you are concerned.  He laid down a book he was reading, and directed his head and one of his eyes toward me and answered, “Dear me, ma’am, I am very sorry—I have sold them.”  My work fell down on the ground, and my mouth opened wide, but I could utter no sound, I was so dismayed and surprised; and he deliberately proceeded: “I didn’t know, ma’am, you see, at all, that you entertained any idea of making an investment of that nature; for I’m sure, if I had, I would willingly have sold the woman to you; but I sold her and her children this morning to Mr. ——.”  My dear E——, though —— had resented my unmeasured upbraidings, you see they had not been without some good effect, and though he had, perhaps justly, punished my violent outbreak of indignation about the miserable scene I had witnessed by not telling me of his humane purpose, he had bought these poor creatures, and so, I trust, secured them from any such misery in future.  I jumped up and left Mr. O—— still speaking, and ran to find Mr. ——, to thank him for what he had done, and with that will now bid you good-

by.  Think, E——, how it fares with slaves on plantations where there is no crazy Englishwoman to weep, and entreat, and implore, and upbraid for them, and no master willing to listen to such appeals.

CHAPTER II.

THE GOLDEN RULE.

“Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would 'that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.” – Matthew 7:12.

“We consign them (the slaves) to no heathen thrall, but to Christian men, professing the same faith with us, speaking the same language, reading the golden rule, in no one-sided and distorted shape, but as it is recorded – a rule to slaves, as well as to masters.” – Judge Woodward’s Speech of December 13th, 1860, page 10, Democratic Edition.

“It is said by some, however, that the great principle of the Gospel, love to God and love to man, necessarily involved the condemnation of Slavery.  Yet how should it have any such result, when we remember that this was no new principle, but, on the contrary, was laid down by the Deity to his own chosen people, and was quoted from the Old Testament by the Savior himself? and why should Slavery be thought inconsistent with it?  In the relation of master and slave, we are assured by our Southern brethren that there is incomparably more mutual love than ever can be found between the employer and the hireling.” – Bishop Hopkins’s Letter, page 4, Democratic Edition.

Slavery never appeared so hateful, nor slaveholders so vulgar and brutal, as in the following extracts, where a woman tells the world what the black women of the South have so long endured.

My Dear E——:

Before closing this letter, I have a mind to transcribe to you the entries for to-day recorded in a sort of day-book, where I put down very succinctly the number of people who visit me, their petitions and ailments, and also such special particulars concerning them as seem to me worth recording.  You will see how miserable the physical condition of
