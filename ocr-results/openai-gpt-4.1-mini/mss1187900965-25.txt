WASHINGTON, D.C.,   Mr 6, 1883

Dear Donglap,

I think the quotation
at the head of your article
a little bit off color.  There
is an appeal to mercy
rather than to Justice -
I think the following from
the same play is better.
"You take my house when you
do take the prop
That doth sustain my house: You
take my life
When you do take the means
whence I live"

You will pardon
the suggestion, What do you
say?
