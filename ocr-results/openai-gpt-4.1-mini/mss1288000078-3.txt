stomach is apt to turn into a 
vinegar factory (as he expresses 
it) during the night.  During
the last week we have been
making soap, & thereby hangs
a tale.  I came home from the
city one afternoon, & was greeted
by Maggie with the pleasing
intelligence that Mr. Kilian's
Johnny had pulled out the
plug of one of the stationary
washtub in which the new made
soap had been put to harden,
& the soap had gone down into
the pipe & hardened there, stopping
the escape of the waste water,
& promising us abundant
trouble & a long plumbers' bill
before things could be set right.
Mr. K's eldest boy is a quiet
well behaved lad who never

meddles with things, while
Johnny has his fingers in
everything.  But Johnny is
considered the smarter, & he
is petted & Tommy rather put
down.  This time, however, his
horrified father gave him
a sound thrashing, proportioned
rather to the harm done than
to the harm meant, which
was none; for he had no
idea of the trouble he was
going to make.  Well, I told
Maggie not to say anything
to Mamma till after supper,
because misfortunes always
seem so much worse when
you hear of them on an empty
stomach.  So when Mamma
came home from Boston
laden with bundles & what not

Mrs. Hopper  W's people, this '94 night I feel that she ought
not to need recuit this sort "not" "deft" "w"
meddles but looks & beckons & petets
me & thinks that I am not pleased I must
finish here & be careful not to cut off Aunt Jane's
next remarks.  It is the day for the farewell poems & there are certainly dozens
at the house that she will not find answer to.
