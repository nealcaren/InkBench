forced upon to draw me into the street at
midnight to murder me and my officers
saying if we got shot officers it will not
both[e] long to fix the niggers and not she
must furnish evidence that she dreamed which
would be given into
was to convey my Regt to Charleston which
was accordingly done and requested threats
to the effect that no-one of them a-d nigger
officers should ever reach the Coast where then
and to this shot after I reached Newbury and
while getting my Supt into camp for the
night I was fired at the Hall passing near
my head of few moments after which I was told
by a Colored man of the town not to leave the
camp that night without a strong guard with me
as she heard the men who had fired the shot
say that they intended to kill the Col of that

before a court martial and a good honorable
acceptance by a verdict of Not Guilty - and
I am again on duty one more pleasing

and that he stood by me like a Brother
through it all.  I was not all surprised
