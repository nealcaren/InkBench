At a recent meeting of the officers of the Tenth New York Volunteer regiment, the following preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted:â€”

WHEREAS, On the arrival of our regiment on the 1st day of July, 1865, at the city of New York, we were entertained and kindly cared for at the Soldiers' Depot, under the direction of Colonel Vincent Colyer, having been furnished with refreshments, music, &c., and the same courtesy having been extended to us on the 3d day of July, when we embarkd for Hart's Island.

RESOLVED, That we do tender Col. Vincent Colyer our heartfelt thanks for the many acts of kindness and courtesy he has extended to us.  We do assure him that our reception, after four years of hard service in the field, was most gratifying to our feelings.  May the noble institution, whose head he is, continue to prosper in well doing, and he may rest assured that every battle-worn and footsore soldier who partakes of his hospitality will thank and bless him evermore.
