supper we all went to the woods to skate and skated until Â½ past eight when I came in and am sitting down to drop a few lines home they all here condemn me for not bringing my skates with me and if it is condemning I wish that you would have them sent with my other things.  I must cut this letter short as it is almost bedtime and we must be up at five o'clock.  I should like to hear from home once in a while and you shall here from me.

I know this is not as good writing as you would like but I am in haste so good night

From your affectionate son Charles R. Douglass
