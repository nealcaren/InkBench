Dear Mr Douglass

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and I write now in hopes of provoking a reply. We really are very much in the dark about you, & do not even know whether you still hold office under the Government, as we have not heard to the contrary I conclude that you do - & therefore that you have not been lecturing & holding meetings over the country this last - or what as of old.  I hope that your health is good - & that you can report well of yourself & of your family.
