joint note which I will endorse; and
secure its payment by a Mortgage on farm
stock, implements & household furniture.
The stock consists of four or five horses, two
ye Alderry Milch Cows, a few Alderry
bulls, 3 Jagges, 1 family carriage, farm
wagons &c.; - the furniture full & in
good condition.  Farming implements
all required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at private sale for
£1600 - and no feel sure nice to sold
some after Spring opens, as it is worth
considerably more money.
They would not allow one to tack this
farm of you £1500, but for the absolute certainty
of the Security they offer; - nor would
I do it steel, but for this emergency
of their situation.  Should this place
be offered at unrestricted sale, it would
ruin the sale privately, as you will
see at a glance.
Can you help them; is this home of theirs

just need? If you can & will so
inform me, I will have the necessary
papers executed & take them & you
any day you may name.
I feel, Mr Douglas, that
while our claim upon you is nothing
beyond your regard for their mother,
pleading, is unnecessary.  If you
can do it,  we will be deeply grateful
& you will be secure in relieving them.
Please write me as early as possible
in enclosed envelope.

Very truly yours
John S Scary
