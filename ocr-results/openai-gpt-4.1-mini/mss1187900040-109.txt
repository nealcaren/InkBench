But it really seems that I ask never - never to, have what I wish for. -
Everything seems against me - I wonder if some of us are really destined to suffer - Perhaps it is the only means of softening the heart - and of teaching us true sympathy -  If so - Oh it is better to be afflicted for it is terrible to be indifferent to the sorrows of fellow creatures.  
I know by sad experience what it is to be shunned by those - upon whom fortune ever smiles -
How hard hearted they are - Their coldness is worse to bear than the [forgiveness?] which breaks the heart -
