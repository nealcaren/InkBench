Dear Journal Friends

There is to be a Suffrage Festival here Nov 14 and 15 and we are to have a Woman's Journal booth. - Can you and
me any decorations and a large card
We have some 3 or 4 "Newsie" Tage - and I
have about 50 subscription blanks.
I've never done anything of this sort and
have little idea how to go about it.
But Dr. MacNaughton who is getting up the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of erecting a booth for the
Suffragist and Dr. Mac N. said that
if she, Dr. Mac N. had to pay
the cost of erecting the booth she would let
it be used for the Journal the paper she
preferred to help - I promised to see to its

Order given to I. L. Grier 11/7/13  E.P.G.
