I know not where to find justice for them; I appeal to your judgment.  
I have ever been friendly to the Colonial race, having lived many years at Cape Haytien in the Island of Hayti, where my husband has a permanent commercial house, under the name of Wilson, Laroche & Co, We are well known to the present President of Hayti, as for years he was interested in the purchase of coffee for the house of Wilson, Laroche & Co.  Mr. Wilson was also Consul for the United States, and the recognition of Hayti was effected by him.  You will find this record in the State Department.  
Be so kind as to write for us to influence public opinion in the favor of the colored people.  
Begging you to excuse me for addressing you I remain  
very respectfully  
Frances L. Wilson
