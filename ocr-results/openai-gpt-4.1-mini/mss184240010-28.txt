Dearly loved daughter
Another birth day
annaversary at hand.
Only think twenty five

of Mary Johnson, called the other
day to ask "if Miss Anna had
anything for them" - I don't know
who she is, though Annie says she
has been here several times before.
My former old German teacher,
Prof. Rose, has gone to his long
home - was buried last Sunday.
Thee will remember my speaking
of his failing health.
