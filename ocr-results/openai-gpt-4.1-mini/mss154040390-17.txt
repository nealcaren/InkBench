with the policies of our own government. The only communists who ever made any trouble with Mexico went there from the United States and were sent back by the Mexican government.

The agrarian revolution in Mexico began in 1910, seven years before the Russian revolution.  Professor Hackett, of the University of Texas, an able and disinterested student of Mexican affairs, has declared: "At the outset it may be said that the Mexican revolution, which began in 1910, was as inevitable as was the French revolution, and as the causes for that more celebrated European struggle lay in the history of France as a divine right monarchy, so the causes of the Mexican revolution of 1910 are to be found in the history of the so-called thirty-five years Presidential reign of Porfirio Diaz."  I believe the facts justify fully and completely the causes of the agrarian revolution in Mexico just as Professor Hackett has stated it.

Let us look these facts in the face.  They ought to silence the lips of those who would have the American people believe that Mexico has simply gone mad over communism.  When Diaz became President of Mexico in 1876, Mexico already had her share of large estates, great ranches, haciendas. During the reign of Diaz, he disposed of some 134,600,000 acres of land, some of it was disposed of legally and some otherwise.  Some of it was sold to parties and some of it was given to political retainers and supporters.  This acreage thus disposed of was about three times the size of all New England.  The average citizen received no part of it - in fact, the small holders were dispossessed and their property confiscated in order to enable the large holders to gather their acreage.

From time immemorial the Mexican villages have owned their communal lands, their ejidos, averaging in area from 4,390 acres to 17,360 acres.  These communal lands were used by the villagers for raising food and pasturing their animals.  These communal holdings were all that stood between the villagers and peonage.  These lands under Spanish and Mexican law could not be alienated.  But Diaz broke up and destroyed over 90% of the communal holdings - a cruel, ruthless, brutal exploitation of the poor people of Mexico.  When these communal holdings were destroyed, 3,103,402 Mexicans passed into a state of peonage, they became serfs, working upon the lands to pay a debt that could never be extinguished.

In 1910, at the close of Diaz' administration, there were 834 haciendas holding haciendas ranging in size from 22,000 to six million acres.  In the state of Morelos alone 20 haciendas owned and controlled the entire state, while 180,000 Mexicans in that state alone were landless.  It is asserted as a fact that at the close of Diaz' administration 96% of the heads of the rural families were without land and without means of acquiring land.  So we have as the result of his administration
