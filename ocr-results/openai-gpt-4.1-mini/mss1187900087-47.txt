"that after a battle of two hours they (the
"Northern forces) were repulsed, leaving
"many dead and wounded, and that order
"and tranquillity reigned in the South.
"We shall have on the 19th a mail of the
"10th from Port au Prince via Navasca, a cable on
"20th via Cuba and a mail again on the 25th
"inst. - I continue to believe that the
"Northern forces will raise the seige and
"retreat to the North, proclaiming perhaps
"secesion, and that the unfortunate state
"of things will continue yet for months.
"If the Governments of Cleveland and Harrison
"had acted in good faith in their rela-
"tions with Hayti, this war would not have
"lasted. - I ask myself if it would not
"be well for me to go to Port au Prince with
"Mr. Douglass to see if the two parties contend-
"ing cannot arrive at an honorable understanding."
Now, my dear Douglass, this letter is already so
long that I must cut it short right here.
Very sincerely and very cordially yours,
Mrs. Bassett and Lotty {will write to Mrs. Douglass}  E.D. Bassett
