My Dear Mrs. Dickinson

I am afraid your business affairs are again suffering. You have not the party calculated to carry most weight. "Nice a man as combined" but "Can't Keep a Hotel." I am sorry, I think has I engineered your "bus" nut John McCauley it might have been now in a definite position -
You told me you would see me about your theatrical business & the next I hear you have "a Boy" (as it turns) dotting with your affairs & â€œmixing those children up." I thought you had a clear experience before with "Avalon Manager," & had learned by experience the science of management. Don't think I am scolding you only that I feel slighted. I cared so more for you than any man in this business, or out of it for that matter & would (or will,) have done it cheerfully
