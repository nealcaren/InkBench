I think that is quite un-
usual for a Seventeen year
old boy. So if you could send
it to me some day, I would
be very happy indeed.
Please remember me to Miss
Wilson & Miss Pick and be
sure to let me know if they
or you come to Washington.
With affectionate greetings
Gratefully yours,
Florence H. Darby
