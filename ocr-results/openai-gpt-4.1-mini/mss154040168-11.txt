with enthusiasm.  They have been much
appreciated - more than you can know.
I am longing to hear who is going to
Rome, how and when.  I am as ignorant
as a mud turtle and I am beginning
to worry lest the mail I need reaches
Panama after I have gone.  You have
been the best correspondent for your
letters are always here when I arrive.
I learn that mails not carried by
this boat to N.Y. but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you will
get this soon. It is not fair to Panama.

Please accept my collective letter
as one for you. I must go & dress now.
I sent it to Mollie. She will deliver it to
her office.  Lovesly indeed!
