We must remember, too, the times in which Lincoln wrought.  In "Constitutional Rights of Racial Minorities in the United States," Professor Arthur E. Sutherland remarks: "Our constitutionalism is partly a system of morals. And moral growth is a slow process." He adds that "social and legal attitudes vary in space as well as time." It is well, therefore, to recall that the Lincoln of 100 years ago was a man of good will striving to loose the bands of oppression from an enslaved people, but working within the social and political milieu of his time and within the bounds of existing constitutional limitations as he and his contemporaries viewed them.

This is not to say that Lincoln did not grow with responsibility in power. On the contrary he himself put the matter exactly right when in his second annual message he said: "The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . . . as our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthral ourselves, and then we shall save our country." He did, in fact, disengage himself from prepossessions. And if his growth seems to have been by slow stages they represent those normal interstitial changes which any dissection of the anatomy of greatness would disclose.

To "save our country" became Lincoln’s magnificent obsession. Herndon has said of him that "his ambition was a little engine which knew no rest." When he achieved the Presidency it was his mind and heart which now knew no rest in the effort to save the Union. From the summit he saw two distinct problems: the preservation of the Union and the abolition of slavery. He believed that the two could be kept separate and that he could save the Union without emancipating the slaves at once. The distinguished author of "The American Political Tradition" says that Lincoln's attitude "arose in part from a sound sense for the pace of historical change. He knew that formal freedom for the Negro, coming suddenly and without preparation, would not be real freedom, and in this respect he understood the slavery question better than most of the Radicals." But he adds, significantly, "they had understood better than he the revolutionary dynamics of the war."

Thus, between his First Inaugural Address, instinct with moderation, and his Second, when he agreed that "this interest [slavery] was somehow the cause of the war" and suggested, even, that it was a providential scourge for the wrongs of slavery, Lincoln’s policy — and he himself — had to undergo radical change. Originally, regarding his rightful role to be that of moderator of extremes in public sentiment, he moved from one expedient to another. He had advocated the statesmanlike operation of compensated emancipation. But the intransigence of all but one of the Southern states doomed it to failure. He had also approved a scheme for the colonization of Negroes — at best a pathetic concept. When these expedients miscarried and Lincoln faced the bleak prospect that his efforts to save the Union would fail, he began a "brilliant strategic retreat toward a policy of freedom."
