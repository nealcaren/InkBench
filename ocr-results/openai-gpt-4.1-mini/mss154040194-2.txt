Dear Mrs. Chapmann Catt,

We took in our programme of this year to read lectures on "Famous Women." Mrs. Reus Ianculescu and I will do it, she in the L.D.D.F. and I in popular evening courses. But as there are no complete libraries in Roumania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books necessary for preparation. Readers therefore to you ask the other sections of I.W.S.A. to ask your help.

Feeling so much the lips of a few library we will try, at one time without studies, to found one at B. and perhaps than will we be able to assemble round it the women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time. Would your association be able for the generous act of more help into sisters and to send us one or the other standard works on women movement in your country and specially books, there we could find biographies of your famous women? It would mean in a first serie of lectures, on political and social movement women and in a second those the portrait of "honesty in art and science."  But we know so little, it's to say not much
