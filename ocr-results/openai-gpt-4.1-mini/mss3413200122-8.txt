trusted to perform our own ablutions instead of being watched by an official hired to mutter prayers while we bathe.

Nothing could be more illogical or more unwise than to treat vivisection as the vice of Biologists specially; nothing could be more futile than to hope to stop it while we treat it so; it would be on a level with trying to suppress the eruption of scarlatina, treating the spots as the sole seat of the disease. Vivisection, as I said, is the outcome of an intellectual disease, which is vitiating the whole scientific and educational life of the nation; and that disease is, resistance to Truth; unwillingness to know the Laws of Thought; laziness in following such of them as we cannot help knowing; jealousy of the intellectual power acquired by those who adhere to them better than we do ourselves; terror at the blaze of light which those laws throw on the whole of our life on earth. Every Schoolmaster and Bishop in this country does something to promote a state of things of which vivisection is the natural and inevitable outcome. We are guilty, too, in our own degree; you, and I, and everybody. Everyone of us can do something to improve that state of things, and to create a condition in which vivisection would become manifestly useless and therefore contemptible.

What we have to do for that purpose is to cultivate steadily a habit of treating our own Universe of Thought, whatever that may be, as a Unity, and thus to promote sanity in ourselves and those around us.

The laws of thought are connected with the discovery of Biologic Truth, not in one important manner only, but in two. In the first place, if the brain does not act according to its proper laws, it becomes unfitted for its purpose as a Truth-revealer; in this respect, every possible or conceivable sort of knowledge must ultimately be dependant for its correctness on the habit of conducting the thought-

life, according to the Laws of Thought. But in the second place, it would seem that the Laws of Thought,—the Laws of the machine called brain,—are in some special sense the key to the Laws of all vital forces. Newton, for instance, discovered the Law of gravity, not by observing stars more than many others were doing, but by studying and keeping the Laws of Thought; and especially that central one: Universe of Thought equals Unity. Having trained his brain in the habit of acting sanely in accordance with its Laws, he compared what was known about the movement of the stars which he could not reach, with the motions of objects within his grasp; and thus was led to perceive the action, throughout creation, of that Law of gravitation which is to a planetary system what its Life-Law is to an animal or plant. Newton, as it happens, has been accepted by the public; chiefly, I think owing to the impossibility of evading the necessity for doing so. If it had been possible to reach the planets and make a brilliant experiment by distorting their orbits, some man would have made a hypothesis founded on his own distortion; the public would have been dazzled and distracted by him, and would have ignored Newton; and we should be, to this day, as ignorant of the laws of motion as we are of the laws of Biology.

For how has it been in regard to other sciences?

Dr. Charles Winslow was studying the Laws of Thought-sequence; and at the same time employing persons all over the tropical world to collect information about earthquakes. After thirty years of study he published a book showing how the Laws of Human Thought really give the key to the phenomena of cosmic disturbance and enable us to organize and explain them. He was strongly advised to leave out of his book all reference to the Laws of Thought, and simply to tell the public what he knew about earthquakes. He steadily refused to do so; what he wanted to tell the public was not how earthquakes
