And six wretched men with eagle heads
Did grasp each golden word,
And with my heart I drew them on
To see my gracious Lord.

Again I stood beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

Growing old.
The prison house in which I live
Is failing to decay.
But God renews my spent strength
Within these walls of clay.

For me a dimmed slow crust
Around Earth's jail - light -
But Heaven spreads closer to my view
And nearer to my sight. -
