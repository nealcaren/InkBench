Hon Fred Douglass
Dear Sir

Francis M. Addington of Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age sends the following offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration 
"Father Abraham's Monument." 

This monument would seem to say 
That Lincoln's dead, but tis not so.
In vain the assassin's aim to slay;
In Vain his blood war made to flow. 
In vain the vile attempt to kill-
In all our hearts he's living still.
And while a drop of patriotic blood
Shall flow in any human frame,
Twill thrill at memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln's name.
This monument we raise to thee
Great Chief whose mandate made us free
        Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
    For thee, our true and constant friend. 2709

Also the following
"Addrift to America Personified."
The world is gazing on thee. 
Dispose thy robes with care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy golden hair.

"over".
