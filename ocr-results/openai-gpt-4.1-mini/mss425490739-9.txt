IN THE LAND O' COTTON
President Warmly Received in Georgia Today.

VISITED MOTHER'S HOME
ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROSWELL AND ATLANTA
Many Tender Recollections of His Early Childhood Awakened by Visit to the Old Homestead.
ROSWELL, Ga., October 20.-President Roosevelt today carried out his long-cherished plan of visiting the home of his mother-Roswell, Ga. One of his reasons for coming south was that he might see the old homestead where his mother spent her girlhood and which she left a happy bride. That the visit was fraught with many tender recollections was evident, and as his carriage drove away from the old Bulloch mansion, where his mother lived and married, the President murmured to Mrs. Roosevelt: "I can hardly bear to leave here."
The President reached Roswell at 7:30 o'clock this morning, and was joined here by Senator and Mrs. Clay, who were his guests at breakfast. He then entered a carriage and was driven to the mansion. This fine old homestead is now the property of J. D. Wing, a lumber merchant of this section, who lives in it with his sister, Mrs. Wood, the postmaster of Roswell.
Here he was greeted by two old servants who lived on the place during his mother's young womanhood. One of these is "Aunt Grace," who acted as maid to Miss Martha Bulloch, who afterward became Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, and the other is William Jackson, who decorated the mansion on the occasion of the marriage of its young mistress.
The President was deeply touched as he shook the hands of these old servitors. In company with Mrs. Roosevelt he then inspected the house, calling to the attention of the company many incidents connected with his mother's childhood. Before leaving the mansion he posed with Mrs. Roosevelt for a picture which included "Aunt Grace" and "Daddy William."

Address in the Town Park.
From the homestead the President was driven to the town park, where a stand had been erected, from which he delivered an address. He was welcomed to Roswell by Charles M. Reed, a student of Mercer University, who in the course of a well-chosen address said the only reason he could see for the selection of himself to deliver this welcome was because of the President's well-known fondness for having young men identified with public affairs. Senator A. S. Clay introduced the President, who was enthusiastically greeted as he arose to speak. He said:
"Senator, and you, my friends, whom it is hard for me not to call my neighbors, for I feel as if you were: You can have no idea of how much it means to me to come back to Roswell, to the home of my mother and my mother's people, and to see the spot which I already know so well from what my mother and my aunts told me. It has been exactly as if I were revisiting some old place of my childhood. It has meant very much to me to be introduced by Senator Clay... Senator Clay has been altogether too kind in what he said about me. Now I am going to say nothing whatever but the bare facts about Senator Clay, and these facts amount to this:

Clay and Cockrell.
"If the average man I had to deal with in public life possessed Senator Clay's firm devotion to what he deems right my task would be so easy that it would not be worth mentioning. I have gone to Senator Clay for advice and counsel and help ever since I have been in Washington, just as I went to Senator Cockrell of Missouri while he was in the Senate, with the certainty that all I had to do was to convince him that what I wanted done was right - I could not always convince him, but if I did convince him that was the end of it - he went that way.
"Oh, my friends, I hardly like to say this deeply my heart is moved by coming back here among you. Among the earliest recollections I have as a child is hearing from my mother and my aunt, Miss Annie Bulloch, as she was then, about Roswell; of how theÂ Pratts and Kings and Dunwoodys and Bullochs came here first to settle; about the old homestead, the house on the hill; about the Chattahoochee; about all kinds and sorts of incidents that would not interest you, but interested me a great deal when I was a child. I wish I could spend hours here to look all through and see the different places about which I have heard all kinds of incidents.
"All those anecdotes, looking back now, I can see, taught me an enormous amount, perhaps all the more because they were not intended to teach anything. I think perhaps we are very apt to learn most when neither we nor the people talking to us intend to teach us anything. If anybody starts in to teach us something we are a little apt to resent it and assume a rather repellent attitude. All those stories of the life of those days taught me what a real home life, a real neighbor life was and what it meant. Looking back now at what I

early.
Everywhere along the line of the parade from the terminal station to Piedmont Park, where the Georgia State Fair Association is holding its annual exhibition, decorations were plentiful. The national colors floated from every building along the way - from business houses to the homes of Atlanta's citizens lining Peachtree street. Pictures of the President were seen on every side, many bearing mottoes of praise and commendation to the city's distinguished guest.
The route of the parade was about three miles long. The presidential train rolled into the terminal station exactly on time, and as it was sighted coming through the yards every steam whistle in the city blew a noisy welcome. Waiting on the station platform were the reception committee, headed by Governor Terrell, Senator S. A. Clay, Congressman Livingston, Mayor Woodward and Bishop C. K. Nelson. To greet Mrs. Roosevelt was a small committee of ladies led by Mrs. Terrell, wife of the governor, and Mrs. Clark Howell. Governor Heyward of South Carolina, a guest of Governor Terrell, was made an honorary member of the committee on reception.
As the train came to a stop Gov. Terrell and Senator Clay, accompanied by Mrs. Terrell and Mrs. Howell, entered the President's car to welcome the distinguished guests. A moment later the party emerged and introductions followed. The original plan to have the President pass the waiting rooms of the station had been vetoed by the secret service, and the party was taken to the street level by a baggage elevator and entered carriages back of the station.
Mrs. Roosevelt and her escort departed almost immediately for the governor's mansion, on Peachtree street, where they were greeted by a reception committee of about 100 society ladies and witnessed the parade from that point of vantage.
The line of march was quickly formed and the President and his escort started for Piedmont Park. The marching order was as follows:
The Line of March.
Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th United States Infantry, acting as marshal of the day; platoon of mounted police; troop of the 12th Cavalry from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., commanded by Maj. H. G. Sickel; President's carriage, containing, beside himself, Secretary Loeb, Gov. Joseph M. Terrell and Maj. James G. Woodward; carriage containing members of the President's party; troop of the 12th Cavalry; carriages of reception committee, city council and delegation from the Federation of Trades; Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th Infantry, U. S. A., Fort McPherson, Ga., and staff.
Seventeenth Infantry Band, 5th Regiment Georgia state militia and band, Firemen's Drum and Bugle Corps of Atlanta, provisional regiment consisting of cadets from the Georgia Military Academy, Gordon Institute and Marist College, Governors' Horses Guards and other military organizations.
The route of the parade was Mitchell street to Whitehall street, to Peachtree, to 14th, to Piedmont Park.
At the Fair Grounds.
The President arrived at Piedmont Park at 11:10 o'clock. The steam whistles of the state fair blew an enthusiastic welcome and the thousands assembled shouted themselves hoarse as the President entered the grounds. A review of the military escort was held, headed by the 17th Infantry, which returned a few weeks ago from the Philippines.
From a stand erected facing the grand stand of the race course the President delivered his address. Dudley Hughes, president of the fair association, at whose invitation the President was present, introduced Gov. Terrell, who in turn presented Mayor Woodward to welcome the President and he was followed by Senator Clay, who introduced the President.
Gov. Terrell's allusions to the President's efforts for international peace were received with rousing cheers. Mayor Woodward presented the President with a block of Georgia marble, a memento from Georgia's organized labor, prepared by union labor.
As the President arose to speak he was greeted by the immense throng rising and cheering.
(The full text of the President's speech will be found in another column of The Star today.)
