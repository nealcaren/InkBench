we make it, Of course
flintiffe meetings & "sincere"
farewells are never said.
I remember your "Such you
dear Frederick dislike sermons"
but - but - let me say, I'm
simply that I never found
any dear Savior so mean, so
precious as now - amidst
the many trials & heart tend-
ings - I dis appointments I
have gone through, I can
realize that "all things
work well and are working
together for good - When
We reach yonder glorious
city, we shall be as dear
friends be enabled to "look
back" on all the way the
master has led us, to
humble us - & prove us" -
May our loving Heavenly Father
bless you forever perhaps
Your ever faithful and
affectionate friend
