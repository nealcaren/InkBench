Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,
2 Monadnock Street,
Upham Corners,
Boston, Mass.

My dear Miss Blackwell:

I am sorry to trouble you again about that annuity.
The annuity has gone through and yet there remains something
to do.

I enclose a paper which they ask both you and me to
sign. You must have a witness, but not a notary, so any one
will do.

I could tell the insurance company to send the checks
to me and they would do it, but all insurance companies have
a rule that any check must be endorsed by the actual person
receiving the money; therefore, when two people are the beneficiaries
of an annuity, both must endorse the check if not otherwise
agreed. Every check, therefore, would have to be sent
over to Boston for your endorsement and sent back to me for
deposit, hence the necessity for getting authority to have all
the checks sent to me.

The annuity has gone through and I have the policy.
I deposited with the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, $1,500 and received annuity $44.96.

The total income from the $1,500.00 is $146.96 per year.
It is my intention to divide that equally with you. You will,
therefore, receive $73.48 each year for your life. I thought
a suitable way to make the division would be this. The first
payment will be made on September 18, 1935 and I will forward
that full check to you. The second will come on December 18, 1935
and I will keep that one. The third will come on March 18, 1936
and I will send it all to you. The fourth will come on June 18, 1936
and I will keep that. In other words, I will withhold every
alternate check and send to you every alternate check, starting
with the first one.  Each quarterly payment will be $36.74.

If I go first, and I fully expect to, you will get all
the interest for the rest of your life. If you go first, I will
get it all. That seems a fair arrangement.

I shall notify the Committee of this arrangement and they
will enter it as they please. You really get for the remainder
of your life, beginning with September 18, 1935, the interest on
$750.00, but you get double that in case I precede you into the
beyond.  I do not think you need to bother yourself with this,
because the Treasurer will do that.

John continued giving concerts as long as there
were any brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law or neighbors to
sing with him, and finally, he gave one when his little
girl was five years old. She sang "The Yankee Boy."

All these things have been highly amusing to
me.  What has become of them all I do not know, but one
brother lost his wife and five children and then died himself.
Perhaps they were all taken off in that way. They certainly
were a great family and most entertaining.

I hope you are well and enjoying life.

Lovingly,
