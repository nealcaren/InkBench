if you will but keep
the eye of your own
spirit turned within -
for it is within
(not without) that
the precious jewel of
truth & right is to
be sought - & found -
And darling - you
will find it, & seek
it, and live it - and
all men & women will
call you blessed -
hastily but oh so dearly

Susan B. Anthony
