exceedingly to be a pleasure
lot to you - You know
have dropped it dead with
me - As it is - I you only
give you all the affection
and sympathy of which my
heart is capable -
Its a few days - I shall
go to Netherlands - but
only for a short time -
I think I shall be there
about five weeks - I shall
be with in England - on
the 23d of August - My
poor old Father will be
very unhappy - to see me
return to poor - These few
days before I have blessed
my hands during the
last six months - I hope
to gratify me even these
few weeks of rest - My
rich pals yield me to have
any affection! Yet they would
not hear.  Well six months
separation from their own children
