To return or she arrives which was the point of departure, let me say that I did appreciate your sweet kindness in sending them and if not too late please accept my truly felt thanks.

Bedtime.

I began this epistle at 9 am and it is now 7 pm It may not be much of a letter but it represents a day's work. To weave I have had hours of convegences with folks who had told me and they gave me a headache and made me sicker all the time.  Now, I'm going to take a stroll about the house while my bed is being repaired and after taking seven kinds of pills, lotions and snifferines, I shall try to get some sleep, for tomorrow I must be well whether I am or not.

I didn't finish that treatise about you and my affection because of the interruption.  It never did get finished for inquiry came at an unfortunate moment. What 'human in the grip of the grips ever loved?  Tuberculosis.  Well I'm Heaven I'd quarrel with the angels tonight.  No Pan
