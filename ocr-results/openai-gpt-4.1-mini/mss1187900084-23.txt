that are thoughtful people, all citizens of Ohio, of whom a few who have the good of the African race at heart will agree with you in the Soundly Philadelphial view you have taken of the subject.  Let your address be published in pamphlet form! 5.  If so I shall order some for circulation. There is not a word or thought in it that I would have changed in any respect.

He is of the old abolitionist and peace part - some mark on it by which he will know from whom he receives it.  

Do you
ever come west in these days?
Should you come to this city
remember you have a carte
Blanche, which if you follow, it will take you to my house
