Nemba back on the arms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets. During recent months it has become apparent that state control in markets where out-of-state milk is imported in volume was not enough. Despite the fact that efficient operation of federal and state control agencies, working in cooperation, is likely to lessen somewhat the need for producer associations, there should be no worry lest the control agencies would put the cooperatives out of business. Control administrators have publicly stated that farmer associations were essential for the smooth operation of the dairy industry.
It now appears that the revised Boston milk marketing agreement, being written under AAA auspices, may never reach a final, acceptable form. The various parties to the writing of the agreement seem determined that they shall not be forced to concede an inch. In view of the fact that Administrator Samuel W. Tator has reminded New England that the agreement is purely voluntary and that he will eventually tire in his efforts to secure the agreement, such tactics are foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow
Seven Germans were sentenced to prison the other day for listening to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two of them having their sentences lengthened to four years for the additional offense of discussing politics while the broadcast was going on.
To most people who have ever happened to "pick up Moscow" this will seem a high price to pay for either the instruction or the entertainment offered. But the same would be true of broadcasts from Berlin or Rome whenever these desert Mozart and Verdi for the arid wastes of propaganda.
Whether Russians are being sent to jail for tuning in on the fuehrer, or the duce, has not been reported, but it is hard to imagine any government being put in danger by the dreary stuff that is being broadcast in prodigious quantities for consumption abroad. It would save all the dictators much trouble simply to let the broadcasts cancel out, assuming, for example, that Russian broadcasts do no more damage in Germany than German broadcasts are doing in Russia.
To admit, by police action, that this is not the case seems like a tacit admission of inferiority in this kind of warfare. If Dr Goebbels has not yet managed to bring the radio armament of Germany up to the Russian level of efficiency it is time for a shakeup in the ministry of propaganda.

American and French Bombing Planes
The description of 24 French bombing planes now being hurried to completion near Paris and claimed to be the biggest of their type in the world, invites comparison with the United States army's Boeing bomber recently destroyed at Dayton, O. With a wing spread of 108 feet the French planes apparently justify, by a small margin, the claim as to size. But the 232-miles-an-hour average which the Boeing plane maintained for the nonstop flight from Seattle to Dayton makes the French planes seem laggards, 12 being designed for a maximum of 180 miles and 12 for a maximum of 208 miles.
The apparent superiority of the American plane is still greater in view of the accepted understanding that its Seattle-Dayton flight was made with only three-quarters of its full power and that its maximum with four 800 horse-power motors, intended eventually to be Republicans are evidently going to harp on it from now on.
While one finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the New Haven ex-mayor that it is more a part of a national conspiracy for Gov Cross to fail to mention the Roosevelt administration than it would have been for him to praise it, the poetic English in which the governor did his praising two years ago does seem to lend some significance to his failure to mention it now. In 1933, the governor, formerly dean of the Yale graduate school and veteran professor of English literature, found his soul stirred, when speaking for New Haven's present mayor, to this glowing passage: —
Over the horizon and the hills the sun has appeared, the eternal symbol of hope and life. We are quickened by a stirring of new faith and courage in a new deal. The dawn of better and happier days under the smiling, hopeful leadership of President Roosevelt tints the east with gold.
The fact that the shrewd old gentleman who occupies the governor's chair down in Hartford isn't saying anything just now about "the horizon" and "the hills" and the "new deal" may perhaps be explained on other grounds than those supplied by New Haven's Republican ex-mayor. It may be, as some shrewdly suggest, that the Democratic mayor of New Haven, having made a good record, deserves reelection on that as the chief issue. It may also be that the Democrats, who generally suffered in the Connecticut city and town elections not long ago, have found that the new deal isn't altogether their best talking point, in Connecticut. And it may be that "Uncle Toby," as his intimate admirers still call Gov Cross, having been quoted during the summer as making occasional remarks which indicated about the same affection for the new deal and its economics as has been shown by ex-Gov Ely, doesn't see the new deal quite as he did in 1933 and just doesn't want to talk about it anyway. Perhaps his silence can be explained in all three ways.

An American mining engineer who lately visited Eritrea says that he found there "a boom such as America experienced years ago on mining frontiers in the West." Why not, with a big army using it as a base? But a mining boom is based on gold dug from the ground, not on wealth dug from the pockets of harassed taxpayers back home.

Shortwave amateur had a wonderful time telling each other about the earthquake. Ordinarily their chats are limited to comparing notes on the weather in different parts of the country, an exciting event at midnight of which the sleeping world has not yet been told keeps the air full of chatter for hours.

It is suggested in a dispatch from Washington that "suasion of business men" may n time lead the government to lay an embargo on trade with Italy. If there is to be an embargo, that is not a very inspiring kind of suasion in its behalf.

Italy sympathizes with the British who are forced to hold an election at so untimely a moment, and Great Britain sympathizes with the Italians who never have a genuine election. Is any country in a position to be sorry for both of them?

Montana may or may not be cheered by being told that its earthquakes are but the growing pains of its mountains. For all practical purposes its mountains are already high enough.
