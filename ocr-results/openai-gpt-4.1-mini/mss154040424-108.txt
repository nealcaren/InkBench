Following the example of all elders I want to give one bit of advice, and I want to leave with you one fact which I have learned as the result of my life's experience.  I do not expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may remember the fact.  The advice is that when you go forth from the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from indigestion; nor is it the idle fantasy of a discordant mind, although these charges have both been made.

Each of you young people has a special racial [underlined] inclusion. You must find your museum there and whole nature.  ...is is natural.

I do not ask you to be reformers—that means giving your whole life to a task and all I am asking you is this: wherever you go, take your whole nature with you.

There is a law of evolution—you have learned much of that during your life in college.  Some regard it as such chunk that it works while they sleep, but I want to tell you that evolution requires evolvers—men and women of vision who are willing to live and to die for their cause.  So I ask you to be an evolver, each of you, along the line where your conviction is strongest.  Learn to think things through, to take into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions of those who do not agree with you, and where you have found your vision things look large and the little thing small.

proposition all the detail which has nothing to do with the proposition.  When you have learned that one lesson in life you will travel along the line of your convictions five hundred times as fast.

You, the sons and daughters of Wyoming, have the immortal example of your state to follow.  When, fifty-two years ago, the young territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone—alone in all the world.  In 1869 I was a young child studying geography, and I remember my map with that yellow splotch which included Wyoming, and it was called the Great American Desert.  The granting of votes to women in some unknown state in that great desert had little influence on the outside world.  What good thing could come out of a desert?  But time brought influence to Wyoming, and then the world jeered at her.  I am sure there must have been men who went as delegates to political conventions and as delegates to Congress must have had a different attitude to defend the action of the state.  To my mind it was a wonderful thing that Wyoming took his stand, a thing really heroic was.  I do not know in all those years of a single instance when she faltered.  The world jeered, and still she stood.  I remember long years ago, for an example, when a man appeared in the City of Boston, and was interviewed by the Boston Herald, always an opposer of woman's suffrage.  The paper quoted him, "The Honorable Mr. So-and-So from Cheyenne, Wyoming, declaring woman suffrage is a failure," and the article said that in Wyoming, although the women had the vote, they never used it; that in Wyoming there were such quarrels in the family because the women did use the vote that there was no harmony; and so on.  It appeared in the morning press in Boston in  [crossed out: days]  Essex. There were few who dreamed
