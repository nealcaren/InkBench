To the Speakers Bureau:

Those roses were sweet, beautiful, temper dispelling, but
Roses sind Verboten.

Keep your money lodg'd tho suit to vindicate my
character. Please don't disobey rules again.

I have a vile temper; growing viler every day which
shows what politics will do for a woman &
is a daily comfort to me unless the pleasantry of
the Speakers Bureau!
