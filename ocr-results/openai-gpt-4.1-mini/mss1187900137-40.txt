Washington, D.C., April 11th 1903
609 F St. N.W.

Mr. B. F. Leighton,
Dear Sir:

Yours of the 6th inst. was duly received, the contents of which was carefully noted by Mr Lewis Douglass.

In reply he desired me to say that he has no disposition whatever, to make any change regarding a stone step on the premises refered to in your letter.

On the contrary, he desires Mrs Helen Douglass' attention called to the fact, that said premises is in immediate need of improvement both in and out, the bad walls, the broken blinds, and especially the sanitary apartments, make it almost untenable.  It is also badly in need of a coat of paint, which, in its conspicuous position, makes a most detestable appearance.

It is the only residence in that immediate neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to the Landlord.

Respectfully yours,  Joseph Douglas
259 B clerk
