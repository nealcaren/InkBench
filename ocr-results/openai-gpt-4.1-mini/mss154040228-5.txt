My Dear Mrs. Catt: 
I am in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, at present with a fractured leg. I have been here 8 weeks today. Hope soon to be released from this terrible house of torture, a cast, so that I can return to my little apartment at 609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena Calif.  Many friends are wonderful to me in many ways.
Address my close friend Mrs. Lois Jewtilda, 1718 Oak St., So. Pasadena - who has all of me in charge.
Cordially 
Henrietta G Moore  579
