curse rather than a blessing.  I would not, at once, entirely emancipate him from the control of his master.  But it should not be, as now, an arbitrary, unqualified control.  For that control I would substitute the authority of Law which should be supreme.  In saying this, sir, I do but carry out a principle which has long been dear to me as an Anti-mason.  I have maintained, and still maintain, and shall continue to maintain, as a cardinal principle in my political creed, that an opposition to all individual and all associated, self-constituted authority, the laws should be maintained in full and uncontrolled supremacy.  There is no being, entitled to the appellation of man, who should not find shelter under the aegis of their broad and ample protection.  In applying this principle to the case of the slave, however, I would not confer upon him the same rights which are possessed by his master; and, for the obvious reason, that he is not fitted to enjoy them.  But I would place him under the supervision of laws made for his special benefit and adapted to his new condition - laws which should essentially qualify the control of the master over him - i which should protect him in all the rights which he is fitted to enjoy, and prepare him for the enjoyment of those to which it would be but a suicidal philanthropy immediately to admit him.  Sir, we owe it to this degraded race of men to prepare them for freedom; to communicate to them moral and religious and literary instruction; to restore and protect the domestic relations among them; to teach them the duties which they owe to God, and to us, and to one another; and to build upon the foundation of a conscious responsibility to the government of Heaven and the authority of righteous human laws, a social structure which it shall be our glory to rear, and their highest earthly happiness to enjoy.
That, Mr. Speaker, while I thus repudiate the doctrine of the immediate and unqualified abolition of slavery, I maintain the duty of immediately and absolutely abolishing the slave trade within the limits of this District.  And here I come to a part of the subject which gentlemen do not choose to approach, but manifestly desire to avoid.  In this I commend their prudence.  The slave trade is an evil for which they well know there is no defence, and no palliation.  I regret, sir, that I have not the means of ascertaining its extent and character within this District.  But the fact that I have no such means, furnishes a strong argument for referring the petitions to a select committee, raised for the purpose of going into a full investigation, and making a full report of the facts connected with this traffic.  I can, at present, only say, I am well assured that the trade is actively carried on in the cities both of Washington and Alexandria, especially in the latter, where is a large receptacle for the securing of slaves purchased in this District and the surrounding country; from which they are, from time to time, shipped to supply the markets in the Southern and Southwestern ports of the United States.  I need not say that, what is usually connected with the slave trade elsewhere is connected with it here - the forced and final separation of parents and children, of brothers and sisters, of husbands and

wives - the utter annihilation of all the endearing relations of human life, and the substitution of the single relation which property bears to its absolute proprietor.

Sir, shall this trade in human flesh be permitted to continue in the very heart of this Republic? Shall the law remain upon our statute book, when solemnly pronounces the citizen of the United States who is found engaged in the slave trade upon the high seas "a pirate," and dooms him to "suffer death," while here, in sight of this very Capitol, the same trade is carried on with impunity?  Shall our citizens, who make merchandise of men upon the ocean, be hunted as outlaws, while here, the same offenders against the human race are suffered to pursue the guilty traffic unmolested?  Sir, this subject demands a searching investigation.  Will gentlemen deny such investigation? Shall the petitions which ask for it be "nailed to the table," or "buried in the tomb of all the Capitols?"  I trust they will not be thus disposed of, and that no fear of "excitement" will deter us from probing the subject to the bottom, and administering a prompt and effectual remedy.

I have, Mr. Speaker, spoken plainly and decidedly, and since it is due to the people whom I have the honor to represent, that I should thus speak.  It seems to me, sir, that the sentiments of the people of the North are not fairly understood here on this subject.

An honorable gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Pierce) has said that not one in five hundred of his constituents were in favor of the object of these petitions; and other gentlemen have been understood to assert that the great mass of the northern people are opposed to any action of Congress upon the subject.  To sustain this view of the matter, the resolutions of public meetings at the North, disapproving certain measures of the abolitionists, have been adverted to.  I am well aware, sir, of the import of those resolutions, and think I understand something of the nature of that public sentiment which they indicate.  And I must be permitted to say, that I believe gentlemen are much mistaken in supposing that they furnish evidence that the general sentiment at the North is opposed to the favorable action of Congress upon the memorials which are now on your table.  No, sir; the meetings which adopted the resolutions in question were got up with no reference to this subject.  What are the facts?  The Southern country had been suddenly flooded from the North with anti-slavery publications; and Northern meetings were, thereupon, convened to disavow a participation in the obnoxious measures, and to express their disapprobation of it.  This they did, indeed, in strong, decided language.  But let not gentlemen mistake the import of all this.  It was the measure to which I have alluded which brought into existence these meetings, and it was this against which their proceedings were mainly directed.  The question of the abolition of slavery and the slave trade in this District was not agitated.  It is not so much as alluded to in the resolutions of the Philadelphia, New York, or Boston meetings; but the doctrine of immediate abolition, and the "extravagant proceedings" (to use the language of the New York resolution) of the abolitionists, constitute the burden of them all.

Sir, there are very many of those who are disposed to press upon Congress the duty of granting the prayer of these petitions, who did not and do not approve the views and measures to which I have adverted; and it is due to frankness to say, sir, that I am among that number.  I have never been able to perceive the expediency or propriety of attempting to inundate the South with evenuneexpionable publications on this subject, much less those having a direct tendency to excite the passions of the slave, and tempt him to force the bondage which it is not for him to break, but for others to unloose.  I admire, indeed, the purity of the philanthropy which seeks to abolish the institution of slavery, and elevate the degraded children of Africa from the condition of property to the privileges of men, but I deplore its often misdirected zeal, and deprecate the reaction which it is calculated to produce.  The abolition of slavery in the States must be their own work.  To convince them that the whole system is ruinous and wrong, is not the labor of a day or a year.  All the questions connected with this subject are eminently practical questions; and nothing can be

more obvious than the danger of failing to accomplish any thing by a premature effort to accomplish at once all that an ardent philanthropy may desire.

I have said that the public sentiment at the North is not understood on this subject.  I believe, sir, it is greatly misunderstood.  A large majority of the people are opposed to certain views and measures, connected with the proposed abolition of slavery in the States; but they entertain, at the same time, an irreconcilable aversion to the institution of slavery, in all its forms.  The most conclusive evidence of this is furnished in all the proceedings at the North, which have been adverted to, in this debate, as an index of public sentiment there.  Thus the preamble to the Boston resolutions declares - "We hold this truth to be in "92 disputable, that the condition of slavery finds no advocates among our citizens.  Our laws do not authorize it; "our principles revolt against it; our citizens will not tolerate its existence among them."
This, sir, expresses, I believe, the universal sentiment at the North on this subject.  It is a sentiment which is not the production of a momentary excitement, but is deeply seated in the sober and settled convictions of the public mind.  And, sir, let me assure gentlemen that no expressions of disapprobation in regard to the measures of "abolitionists," or doubts as to the practicability of immediate emancipation, are to be taken as evidence that the "principles" of the Northern people have ceased to "revolt against slavery"; or that they will not avail themselves of every suitable occasion to discuss it, as well as of all reasonable and constitutional means of remedying the evil.  The slavery of the States they know they cannot reach, but by moral influence; and that influence they think can be made most effectual through kind and respectful, though earnest and urgent appeals to the Southern interest and the Southern conscience.  But slavery here, they regard as within the competency of national legislation, and hold themselves, in common with the whole country, directly responsible for its continuance.  And I need hardly say that there is a very general desire that measures may be immediately taken, looking to its final abolition; and especially that what has, by almost the whole civilized world, come to be accounted piracy upon the high seas, shall no longer be suffered to go unpunished and unmolested in the capital of this Republic.

The venerable member from Massachusetts (Mr. Adams) has said, and said truly, that opposition to slavery is, with the people of the North, a religious principle.  An honorable gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Jones) replies, by asking, with emphasis, whether it is the religion of the Savior of men?  Sir, I did not expect to hear such a question seriously propounded here.  I was not prepared for an intimation that religion inflicted the holding of human beings as property.  Why, sir, what is the great, leading, moral precept put forth by that Saviour, whose name is thus invoked to sanction the practice of slavery?

"All Things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them."

Sir, I will attempt no commentary on this precept.  It needs none.  I will only say that it contains the seminal principle of the pure and elevated morality of the Christian system - a morality so congenial with the spirit, and so constantly enforced by the example of its Divine Author, while upon earth.

Now, sir, let gentlemen show me that Africans are not "men," and I will give up the argument.  But, until this is done; until declaration is blotted from the Book of Revelation, that "God hath made one blood all nations of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth;" and until this great truth ceases to find a response in every human bosom, shall slavery stand rebuked by this all-comprehensive, wise and sublime precept of the Saviour of men.

But, sir, the religion which contains this precept, also enjoins submission to the "powers that be."  The same mouth which uttered it said, "render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's" - a precept coincident with that which exhorts - "servants be obedient to your own masters; not answering again; not purloining, but showing all good fidelity."  The Saviour made it no part of his business, while upon earth, to subvert the existing order of things,

or to prescribe specific regulations for the administration of civil government.  But he came to redeem men from sin to write the law of love upon their hearts - to establish principles and proclaim precepts, before whose searching and all-pervading influence the time-honored systems of injustice and oppression shall melt away.

Permit me now, Mr. Speaker, to examine, for a few moments, some of the objections which are urged against the legislation of Congress on this subject.

We are told, in the first place, that this is a question which concerns exclusively the people of this District; that the petitioners have no interest in it, and have no more right to ask Congress to abolish slavery here, than they have the petition the Legislature of Virginia to abolish it within her limits.

Sir, the people who have signed these petitions regard themselves as citizens, not alone of the particular States in which they reside, but of the Republic.  Every interest within the scope of the legislation of Congress is their interest.  Every thing which concerns this Territory concerns them: its police: the value and security of the public property within its limits; and the safety of the Representative bodies annually assembled here.  This is the growing capital of a great Republic.  What may be the absolute or relative increase of its slave population, or how much it may affect the future condition of this District, cannot easily be foreseen.  That population amounted, in 1830, to more than 6,000.  The time may come when it will amount to ten times that number.  And is it of no importance to our country whether its Capitol shall be surrounded by a mass of hardy, independent freemen, ready to peril their lives in defending it, as well as themselves, from the invasion of a foreign Power or whether it shall be guarded by 60,000 slaves, who, instead of rallying in its defence, may hail the invader as an angel of deliverance from their bondage?  And is not this subject invested with additional interest, when it is considered that the Congress of the United States will be surrounded by such an amount of such a population?  Have the petitioners, then, as a part of the American people, no interest in this question?

And then, too, there is the character of the country as it may be affected by the institutions within the Territory, where the legislative power of that country is supreme.  Its slavery tolerated in this District? The petitioners feel themselves, in some sense, responsible for it.  Is merchandize made of men, within sight of the Capitol in which their Representatives are assembled, and on whose summit wave the stripes and the stars of freedom?  As Americans, they keenly feel the reproach, and instinctively reach forth their hands to wipe out the stain from the escutcheon of their country.  

But, in the second place, it is asserted that Congress has no right to legislate on this subject; that, however great may be the evil of slavery or the slave trade within this District, it is an evil which must be borne, since authority to remedy it is not to be found among the powers granted in the Constitution.

And what are the powers of Congress touching this subject?  Is it true that Congress is authorized to extend its legislation to the high seas, even to the very coasts of Africa, and to prohibit the traffic in slaves, under the penalty of death, while it is powerless to reach the same evil in the very heart of the Republic?  If the grant of powers must be so construed - if there is clearly no authority by which the Government can act in this matter, then must we submit to the evil, and wait an amendment of the Constitution, which shall make it consistent with itself, and save the country from reproach.

But sir, fortunately for the country, the Constitution, through which we derive our powers, is not thus defective.  The power to legislate upon this subject is granted; and that, not by remote implication, but in terms of obvious and familiar import.  The 8th section of the first article gives to Congress authority "to exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of Government of the United States."

In the first place, let it be observed, the power of Con-
