at Belfast & . . . . . . . . however in this city long enough to hold two meetings. I shall not accompany Miss B Belfast or in any part of Ireland. He will have the field to himself. I could not be with him at Cork but it will not be in my power.

I am now about to tell you something which will make you think me the most fickle of men. I have decided to stay in this country six months longer and I should not wonder if Mr Wright should do the same. Though I am sure with far less reason than I have to justify me in staying. I have decided to stay in consequence of the advice both of the Garrison and Mr Thompson.

Both think the present to be a most favorable opportunity for modulating the awakening feeling of this country and bringing it to the aid of the true anti-slavery Society in America and each think it would be wrong for me to miss it. I have therefore decided to stay.
