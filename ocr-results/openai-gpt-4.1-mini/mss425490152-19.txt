My future saw something of mine - 
We all admire you - I believe - and, 
love your forts - and are so glad
that you had such ones - Now 
why did you get this letter June eve, & 
off this - did newlyland clouds
my groton, which trespassed here and
which he trespassed - is trying very hard
with few members now - to introduce
1 1/2 rooms - into a useful modern
place for the young people to live
and grow in - thus trying to
kind of partly of the few of day
who might want to help us do
so.  True doing some services 
with F. C. - students - of two levels
there, and the names are out, but
would certainly be a great joy to
them and every one - pleased
to think of doing something in
this desire - It would be truly -
with my good wishes.
