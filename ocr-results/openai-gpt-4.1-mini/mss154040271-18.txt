Dear Mary: I received a book yesterday - the 27th gift this spring! If this book tells how to attain success with a book when the author (would be) has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary to express the joke though so he has, it will be most welcome. Until I have read it I shall not know whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or without thanks either way! I am sending you a tiny box of left over seeds. There is no gift. I just had these left & haven't the remotest idea what any of these are, but we will find out. If you were nearer I should have how given you a garden full of plants from the greenhouse, all of which will either die in my garden or give mothered little blossoms. That would have been stalwart wonders in yours!  When you come down, I shall take you to see a garden that is worth looking at.
