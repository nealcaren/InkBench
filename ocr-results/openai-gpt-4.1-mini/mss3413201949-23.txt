(1) The Useless Waste of War
When the great war began 27 billions of old War debt stood upon the borders of Europe. The total coin money + bullion in circulation in the whole world was about eleven billions of dollars, yet the nations plunged full well into the war, borrowing all they could, printing paper money + not stopping to count the cost. At the end the international debts were so complicated + burdensome that a universal panic followed. What useless waste! Any wonder they can not pay their debts to us? Do you know that every man killed in the late War cost the living $17,000?
