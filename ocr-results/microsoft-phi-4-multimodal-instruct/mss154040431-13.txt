**ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10% of Common Grace: Berlin Councillor Declares.**

**NEOUS SS. Nov. 11**--A momentous announcement in the Prussian House of Representatives provoked a storm of protest Saturday when Herr Councillor von Haussmann (Conservative), member for Gollnitz brought forward figures to indicate that illegitimate children now made up 10 per cent. of all births in Prussia. 

He said that, according to returns, there were already 53,500 illegitimates, a “most deplorable state of affairs”.   He declared many convictions were recorded, though he acknowledged that extended penalties were almost never imposed. He believed that the evil could be swept back with a vigorous campaign of educational reforms and better safeguarding of women. 

“Every enquiry for an adoption,"  Herr von Haussmann went on, "is so caught up in technicalities as to invariably lead to a hopeless termination. Under the present laws the applicants have so many avenues and obstructions cleared by somebody or other that legal fees are often well over 200 marks before the destination is reached.”

_“The Prussian House of Representatives occupied with a discussion of illegitimate births, proceeding to deal with the very difficult question of its experience of illegitimacy in Prussia, state the report, is not a condition to be taken lightly, nor is it a question to be done away with easily."_
