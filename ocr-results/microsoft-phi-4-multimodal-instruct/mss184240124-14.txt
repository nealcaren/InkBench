Miss Anna E. Dickinson,
1065 Forest Ave., Bronx,
New York City

Dear Miss Dickinson -

I am sorry it is impossible for me to answer intelligently the questions you ask, for the reason that I am not strictly speaking a theatrical man, simply a business Manager. I have, however, asked Mr. Lindsay Morrison, who is Manager of the Boston Theatre, and a gentleman who is thoroughly posted in matters of this kind to reply to your favor.

Thanking you for your kind wishes, I remain,
Very truly yours,

[Signature – appears to be "Henry D. Rippee"]
