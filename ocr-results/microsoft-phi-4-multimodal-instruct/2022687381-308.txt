PROSPECTUS.

THE American nation, embracing in its origin the elements of civilization found in all other countries, has, as a portion of its manifest destiny, the taking to itself of the Good and Beautiful, wherever it cannot be independent of other races. As we avail ourselves of the scientific improvements of other races, or as others avail themselves of ours, so should there be a mutual enjoyment of the advantages to be derived from the intellectual labours of those great minds which have conferred glory on their native countries and on the world. Every true great writer is invariably a cosmopolitan in thoughts and labours for the whole world, and no part of who thinks and labours for the whole world, and no part of who deserves to be made known to every one in our own country, who claims to be well educated or informed. Genuine classic literature is the best and most appropriate reading for an intelligent and independent public – it is the old and in a calm pleasure, the middle-aged an incentive to earnest thought and action, and the young - a guide to that enjoyment of the beautiful, to which their every intellectual and physical sense is so keenly alive. Being convinced that both subject and labour require an noble pains, whether in the literary or musical preparation of sound, classic works, and having been still further induced, by the representations of those engaged in instruction, and the necessity of such an undertaking, have determined to give to the great names of German Literature a home in American publishing in the twenty-fourth of March of this year, *The Literary Emporium,* a weekly number.

HENRY HEINE, in the original text, and in Weekly numbers. With this number, I begin the publication of what I believe to be a translation of *Charles’s Guiding*, etc., *the Reisebilder,* or Pictures of Travel by HEINLE, merits, of the talented translator, is to inspire as already known to our literary pupils, for who is himself built upon the foundation of a thoroughly possible of one and to render it worthy in power to comprehend the spirit of a poet, his life and his labours; for HEINLE introduces, as a translator, a wealth of suggestions as those familiar with the character of

*the foreign sentiment.*
