sober, ascertaining the address of his family, go with him to the express office and with his consent forward it to them, leaving him enough and pay his fare home and follow on after. We had several such cases.

Many ways of cheating the men were constantly practiced, and with the utmost vigilance we could hardly stop it; backed up as the rascals were by some of the judges elected by the people. A case reported in the Evening Post, of May 31st, in which Mr. Kennedy, our energetic and faithful Superintendent of the Police, was arrested for contempt of court, for not immediately letting one of these rascals go, is as follows:

THE ARREST OF MR. KENNEDY – CASE OF COLONEL COLYER AND THE JEWISH CLOTHIER ALKERS.

The fact of the arrest of Mr. Kennedy on a writ of contempt, issued by Judge CABINOZO, and his subsequent return, has already been published. The facts in relation to the arrest of MORRIS ALKERS, in whose behalf the writ of habeas corpus was issued, were not published. It appears that Alkers keeps a clothing store in Canal street. On several occasions he has visited the Soldiers’ Depot corner of Howard and Mercer streets, where he distributed his business cards, which had a Masonic emblem at the top.

By this means he secured a number of customers among the soldiers, and the Superintendent says he regularly cheated those dealing with him. One week ago last Sunday afternoon, Alkers visited the depot during divine service, and persuaded eighty Western men a suit of clothes, ranging from fifty to one hundred and twenty dollars each. Three or four of these men went west the same evening. The next morning one of the others showed his clothing to the officers in the depot, and was told that he had been grossly deceived.

He was advised to go to Brooks Brothers and learn the value of the goods, which he did. He was informed that a suit of clothing for which he had paid eighty dollars could be bought for thirty dollars. Colonel COLYER then made the man refund the money. Then Kennedy, who detailed a detective, remaining thirty dollars for the clothing. The other several men had remained in the city, learning of the success of their companion to merchant and received more than half of the money they had originally paid. To one of the men Alkers gave two suits of clothing rather than refund any money.

At the retiring of the troops, Kennedy, it is said, determined to arrest Alkers and bring him to justice. Sherman says he got no notice of the intended arrest and was therefore taken by surprise. Kennedy applied to Judge CABINOZO for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted, and Alkers brought before the court.
