I know not where to find pastime
for them; I appeal, do your judgement.
I have ever been friendly to the
coloured race, having visited many
years at large. Haytown on the
Island of Hayti, when my husband
was a prominent commercial man,
under the name of Wilson La Force,
& Co., we were known to the present
President of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee for the house of Wilson La Force
& Co., One Wilson was also Consul
for the United States and the
recognition of Hayti was effected
through him. For with Junior his Record
in the State Department.

Be so kind as to write for us to
influence public opinion in the
favor of the Colonial people.

Begging you to excuse me for
detaining you I remain

Very Respectfully
Francis L. Wilson
