My dear Clara:

That book is one I mentioned to Rosa. I
told her I thought the title was “Her Secret Avenue.” I did
not know that was the title at all. It was a book some-
one loaned me on a steamer about ten years ago. I do
not remember the author or the publisher and never owned
the book. You had better tell her to go to
…

Everything out here is dried up forever.
It is nice weather for City folks, but quite terrible
on farmers. It has been hotter than ‘anama.’ 
I think Mary Gray Peck is coming to spend
Sunday, August 26th. When I get her answer, I will let
you know, for we are expecting you to pay us a visit at
the same time.

Thanks for the information about the coupons, 
etc.

Lovingly yours,
[Signature]
Carrie Chapman Catt
President.
