EMANCIPATION AND COLONIZATION.

The city of Carmen has about 5,000 inhabitants; its aspect from the port is very picturesque and beautiful. Mariners, on their entering, may be guided by a fine fixed light in the Indian village opposite the place, which light can be seen fourteen miles at sea. The principal commerce of this town consists in the extraction of logwood, the annual exportation of which is from six hun-dred thousand quintals. The price generally ranges from 75 cents to $1.25, ac-cording to the demand, or the great or small supply in the market. 

The logwood is carried to Carmen in canoes of from four hundred to a thousand quintals burden, from Tabaney, Chibojo, Guibaja, Chumpan, the Ranchos of the East, Palisada, and principally from all the ranchos on the river Usuma-cinta, passing through Palisada. The interior of the country is generally swampy, and its greatest production to-day is logwood. There is also in the interior of the country a large quantity of cedar, mahogany, and, until more recently, not been an object of great extraction or exportation.

There are at present ten or twelve establishments for the elaboration of sugar and aguardiente (sugarcane rum,) and with time these articles may be produced in abundance for exportation. 

What is now considered as the territory of Carmen has about 20,000 inhabitants.

If the country was more thickly peopled, so as to facilitate labor for agricul-tural pursuits, it would probably be one of the richest facto of country in the world.

Steam communications could be established from Carmen to the rivers of Palisada, Chumpan, Candelaria, Mamantel, and Ca√±o de Tabaney, by deepen-ing a little the bars of these rivers, which could be done without any great out-lay, and with lucrative results to any one who would undertake the enterprise. 
The distance by sea from Vera Cruz to Laguna is two hundred and seventy miles; from Laguna to Frontera de Tabasco, by sea, forty-eight miles; or to San Juan Bautista one hundred and fourteen miles by sea and river.

The total number of vessels that have entered this port during the last ten years is 688, of which 317 have been coasting vessels, and 371 foreign vessels. 

Laguna possessed, at the time of the conquest, a considerable population among the Chontal Indians, who paid tribute to the Spanish Crown. On account of the castigations and dangers incident to that savage epoch, the population was gradually diminishing, until it reached the small number now existing.
