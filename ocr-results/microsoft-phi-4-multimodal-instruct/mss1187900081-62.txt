Sir tu closerd
Clifton from the Kansas City Times
of the 25th.  I quote from it. "It
was scarcely to deny its awareties;
if you did adversely, and succumbed
to the state's full raid, the land
would much perplex us -  we want.
We have been induced to believe the
Crime be fully relieved upon to
Cash their election debt for our
Battery Standards besides Harrison
and Master of reply, either
comforting or denying the reason of
the sickly style of it, "
