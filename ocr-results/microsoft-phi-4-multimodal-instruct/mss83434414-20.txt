*Mustered out of service.

Instructions were given to surgeons-in-chief to relieve the medical department of the army of the care of sick refugees and freedmen, and aid Assistant Commissioners in establishing hospitals for such patients as could not be otherwise provided for, recommend, and employ the requisite number of physicians and attendants to supply the wants of the sick.

It was soon discovered that the want of funds at the appropriation, and the limited amount of funds at the disposal of the Commissioner, for the employment of physicians and attendants for the sick, would embarras the operations of the medical department.

The Surgeon General having authorized, in Circular No. 3, certain series, medical purveyors to issue to the bureau medical and hospital supplies in accordance with the standard supply table which had been prepared and the instruments adopted for the use of the freedmen, surgeons-in-chief were instructed to report all applications for the use of standard supplies, directed to them, to the Medical Director of the Bureau at Washington City.

The number of hospitals and stations for refugees and freedmen, on the 30th of September, 1865, was 309; number of physicians employed, 555; number of employ√©s, 3,984; number of patients relieved, 164,748.

The aggregate expenses of the medical department for the quarter ending September 30, 1865, was $1,876,238.78.
