Dear Voters in the Convention by Mail
of the National Woman’s Party:

The report of the Elections Committee, signed by Dr. Margaret Seabee, Chairman, has been handed to me. A copy is enclosed herewith.

Delegates from all over the country sent in their ballots. Each delegate represented twenty-five members. All nominees proposed by the Nominating Committee were elected. A number of other names were written in; in many cases these were of members who had, for one reason or another, expressed their inability to serve, and whose names had therefore not been proposed by the Nominating Committee.

It will be recalled that in addition to the newly elected Council members, all former National Chairman and all State Chairmen are members of the National Council ex officio.

May I, as our Convention Chairman, thank all of you for your splendid cooperation during this, our first Convention by mail. The registration fee which many of you National Chairman.
