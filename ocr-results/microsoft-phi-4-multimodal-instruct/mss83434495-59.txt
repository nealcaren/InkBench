going back until I was left with a very thin line. I had been directed to remain until an officer came to me with orders to retire. That the enemy might not suspect our movement, I was told to have my men keep up a fire along the picket line, discharging their guns at intervals. I remained for two hours, going back and forth along my line, seeing that my men kept up the shooting. As no officer arrived to tell me to come in, I got uneasy, and finally concluded our force had retired and we were forgotten. Acting on this I collected my men, fired one last shot, and prepared to return to camp. The night was very dark, and we could only guess at the course we ought to go. Fortunately we opened correctly, and in a little while emerged from the wood into the grass field, where soon a camp where we could see a light or two burning. We were in a little while in front of Peters burg, and were asleep.

CHAPTER XX.

On page 944 of Volume V. of Bates’ History of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, it is stated that "until near the close of August the Sixth was kept almost constantly on duty in the trenches in front of Peters burg.” This is clearly a mistake, as we went to Dutch Gap during the first week in August, immediately after the battle of the Crater in front of Petersburg, and remained there until September 28th. On the latter date we were ordered to prepare ourselves for a heavy march. The order was received during all men who were unfit for our march. Those who were ready to proceed down the James. We started about dawn and before midnight we were put on shore at Deep Bottom, where we rested without shelter of any kind until morning.

Those who are familiar with the movements of our troops near Petersburg, the siege of Petersburg, will remember that on Septem ber 29th, 1864, General Warren was pushed out on the extreme left of our line, in an effort to capture the Weldon railroad, to interrupt communication with Richmond. The result did not justify the experiment.
