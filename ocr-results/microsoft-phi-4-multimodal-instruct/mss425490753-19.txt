**DENEEN SOUNDS Campaign Attacks County Administration.**

By PARKE BROWN
April 5, 1929–State Chairman Paul Morely, in an outstanding speech at the Lincoln Auditorium last night, declared that the People’s Republican County Administration is performing so well that the Democrats are “thrown on the defensive.” The mostly of the long address, which drew a capacity crowd, was a refutation of the flinging that has been made against the Administration, particularly the charging of political wastefulness and extravagance.

“[quote] The employes of the county in every department save exceeded all expectations and I make a challenge to any Democrat, to any Democrat to show me anywhere in the county where we have done a bad job,” Morley declared. 

He announced that the Republican organization of Cook county is planning a series of mass meetings throughout the county to present the record of the People’s Republican County Administration and “teach the Democrats that the course they are taking!”

**WIFE DIVORCES MORSE IN RENO; HE LOSES PLEA**

Reno, Nev., Dec. 10 – Leopold Morse, former Carson City district attorney, was divorced yesterday in Reno from Mrs. Elizabeth Morse. 

The decree, granted on the grounds of desertion, was accompanied by an order that Morse pay his divorced wife a monthly allotment of $100 for her support. 

Mrs. Morse, who filed the suit two months ago, testified that she had not seen her husband since last May, when he left their Reno home and went to California.

Judge Parker said in ruling against Morse’s motion to set aside the marriage as fraudulent that there was “no foundation” for the assertion of fraud. 

During the past year more people have come to Reno to gain divorces than ever before. Last year “quickie” divorces amounted to 752.

**SENATOR SAYS**

“I assure you I had a thoroughly good time, all day yesterday in Washington City, regardless of the kind of weather they gave us as it poured and right down from the ether” said Senator William H. King, in a letter to his friend, Samuel F. Hoag.

**CITY BRIEFS**

[small text]  Clark, Smith & Lamphier have secured a contract for the excavation of the Tribune tower.

**CORRECTION**

A typographical error in yesterday’s edition needlessly lengthened the name of James Huston of the Huston Wheel Co. His name is correctly spelled Huston.
