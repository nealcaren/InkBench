Washington, D.C.
Dec. 6. 1834

Dear Father,

I received a piece of the *Times* is just received. 
I saw an account of our affairs in New
Jersey published in the *N. York Intelligencer*, & thought
that you might have other appointments, and hearing
avoid it.  I inquired of attending him, we are afraid he
will have the croup. but he is well. I don’t wish to trouble
your mind about the affair between Sarah. Sand and myself. 
I know your mind, and time is better vouchsafed. You
may learn the cause of the difficulty, but I know you don’t
know the whole truth, and it is hard to find your mind
against us. [Good] for another man. If you will be at home
any length of time I will write again. Soon, as I am
very busy just now. Sarah worked hard last [week], if she knew
it was nothing. Her is mother well.

Your aff. Son,
Chester A. Douglas
