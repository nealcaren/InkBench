Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,
29 Wendell Street,
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Alice Blackwell:

Mead has died as the result of an accident.

She used to write to me occasionally and she had told me how her sister was in a hospital, perhaps the one, waiting for their call Up Yonder. I take it that she was their only source of comfort and she went to the hospital every day to read aloud to her husband.

Every once in awhile she would get an article on peace and send it to a little syndicate of papers that always welcomed her articles. I presume she did not have much money and I hope she got a little pay for those articles.

She was a valiant soul, if ever there was one, and I am sorry she has gone.

I do not know anyone in Boston to whom to express my sympathy, so I am sending it to you.

If there is anyone who would be interested, you may send the enclosed comment to that person.

Lovingly,
Carrie Chapman Catt
