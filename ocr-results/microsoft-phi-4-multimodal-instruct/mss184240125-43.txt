I came to Boston on Nov. 2
soothe a ghost visit before winter, &
I am still here, now wishing winter
to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have 
seen none of the celebrity, they were
not worth seeing. I thought I should
see you here this spring, because the Papers
said so, but has been a dreary winter, 
but spring & violets are near the corner.
 Lizzie writes me often, & is happy 
her lot of housework is all easily.
But if she is what she is, she protects
in every district that the frets, the homes
suffer. She has a good practical mind, &
keeps herself every nuisance of things. Don't
easy. Send Bless you always. 
Lovingly - Marnia Day.
