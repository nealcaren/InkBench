President of the Leslie Woman Suffrage Commission
New York

Dear Mrs. Catt,

I am sure you received my last letter with
the receipt and my very best thanks for your draft, with this letter
I have the liberty to submit to you the following communications and
motions to be transmitted to the Leslie Woman Suffrage Commission in
September.

1. I join in the sincere request of Malie Gourdin for an elevation
of the subvention from 500 to 1000 Dollars are 1926. I abstain from repeating how precious this augmentation would be for
our so poor woman’s suffrage movement.

2. I shall forward to you in a few weeks the report about the use
of the money you so kindly sent to us. In our meeting of the central
Swiss board of woman’s suffrage this au. turns we shall have a final
decision on the proper use of the right for the suffrage.

3. As to your inquiry about 1926 the Swiss Alliance for Woman's
Suffrage is ready to raise a 1000 Dollars once more for the 1st of
April 1926, hoping that the Leslie Commission could grant us a con-
tribution of 1000 Dollars too.

Let me thank you once more for the real interest
you have in our movement and run for signing sincerely

Annle Reisch-Keucht 
Treasurer of the Swiss Alliance for Woman Suffrage
