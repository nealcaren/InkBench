A CALL TO ACTION

There is not an audience in this country nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the hearts of the people.

There is no attitude to international peace that does not respond. There is no one in all the world who is willing to say that he wants another war. 

There is not anybody who does not want peace, but how are we to get it? That is the practical question, and in our own states and cities, before we can act collectively think other nations, but it is for our selves in our own country.

We don’t settle that question when we have a million different points of view, but wait for somebody to act.

Everybody at this time is extremely careful about being non-partisan. I don’t care a rap about being non-partisan.

I was for a Democratic League of Nations. I am for a Republican party or any other kind. I believe in taking action on questions of this kind and not waiting too long. It does not matter what party is in or who is President. Our country is not judged by its parties. It is judged as a nation.

Today there isn’t anybody in this nation who knows what we are going to do; nobody in any other nation who knows what we are going to do. But I ask you, if there is anybody campaigning to moment with an earnest crusading spirit who is as still and indifferent apparently, and as inactive, though there was not before us the greatest question which was ever presented to the nations of the world.

We are as jealous of our own way as it is upon our nation. We have always been in favor of arbitration. It was this country, I believe, that signed the first treaty of that character, we are the people, we don’t believe in war as a nation, then, we are the people settling questions and not force.
