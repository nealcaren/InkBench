My dear Steady: I thank you for his
letters and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs. Blinn. I thank you especially for the clip-
pings for as you suspect, I have h-thanked her
in the outgoing East yarn, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention. Station, Mrs. Sweet brought
a letter she had received from Effie Vance,
and she had described very vividly how
Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her
suffering throâ€™ Christian Science. Somebody
esteemed in Ch Si. Mrs. B. was one of the most innocuous and forgiving women I ever
met, and with the and co. risk of, she was
a woman to be admired for very many
estimable qualities.
