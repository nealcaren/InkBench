"The Governor cares – really," said Mrs. Ney, and she added, with a lift of the lips, "I am sure he does care, for I have seen personal kindness, kindness that is seldom found in politicians."

“Well, I confess I am not following the inductive logic,” was Mr. Wise’s reply. "The things I strive to realize, every man has a right to do."

It was a smile that prompted the remark.

"Now, you say the Governor is so kind." 

"Kindly now. But to promise a thing and then….” She paused, her face darkening.  "It is the history of my sufferings to be thus deceived.   I cannot see any point in future assurances."

“I think I understand you perfectly,” said Mr. Wise. He brought his hand down on the desk with a heavy thud.  "It is a remedy that there would be an explanation of the case to a special body."

She nodded.  “Yes, that is all I want.  I am willing to face a council, if possible.”

“There you’ve hit it,” said Mr. Wise.  *“If you will not go as far as a council, you’ll debar me the credit to be devoted to the matter of such office and so positiver fight my case for many a year to come – and you will promise me.”*

What would Mr. Wise do now, you think, if you read this?  He replied, “In the first place, I must say that such a promise as is expected is the promise of creed and conviction – not mere formality. It’s a promise only a true heart can give.”

He saw that she was not reassured. "I beg pardon if I misunderstood you; but, an idea is due to your ears that I have a habit of considering every subject about me before I am bound to act or decide; if I obligate myself to act, nothing that may arise hereafter in the course of human events will cause me to shrink at my duty, I am pledged to do that I don’t like or don’t like it."

“I’ll fully concede,” she said, “that it is in human nature to be reluctant to pledge.  I’d not ask such a concession of you if I had thought, to the degree as I am compelled to believe, that it was not very important.”

It would want “– yes, I think it is my clear and wise decision to face this more than my relations.”



Mr. Wise paused. “There in one endowment; is there another?”

"I want deliverance," she said. 



Mr. Wise smiled. “There’s a ferment in this that’s more active than ours. You have done very much more than I am prepared to claim.



And you will read that all matters of state are matters of policy following conviction"— He checked himself. "There sanged in the way in which I’m engaged which did not strike us or taught us to follow.”
