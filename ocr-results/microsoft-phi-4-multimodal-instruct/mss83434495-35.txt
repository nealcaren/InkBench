CHAPTER XI.

Before leaving Yorktown and the “Peninsula” for good I want to speak of my visit to the “Yorktown Centennial” in October 1881, when the one hundredth anniversary of the surrender of Lord Cornwallis to General Washington was celebrated there. That surrender ended the war of the Revolution, when we achieved our independence as a nation.

To reach Yorktown I went from Brookville to Pittsburgh over the Allegheny Valley railroad. From Pittsburgh I went to Washington, and their light, one after another, along the avenue from the Capitol building to the Treasury, and witnessed the beautiful illumination it caused. It was known all over the city at what hour the illumination would take place, and the avenue was crowded with people the entire distance I have indicated, nearly a mile. The scene was brilliant, increased and intensified by the large number of people who were assembled to witness it.

From Washington I went to Richmond, passing through Fredericksburg, close by the place where my only brother was buried, who was killed there in December of 1862.

From Richmond I went by the Danville and West Point railroad to White House Landing, near where the Pamunky and Mattapony rivers unite to form the York River. The “White House” was a place of considerable importance during the Peninsula campaign, and subsequently during the civil war; but long before that it was a place of interest to Americans. Here it was that George Washington first met Mrs. Martha Custis, the “beautiful young widow,” who afterward became his wife; and as I passed the railroad station here, where twenty-five or thirty pretty girls and young women were engaged in animated conversation, forming a handsome picture, my mind ran back to the time and the account of the first meeting between Washington and his future bride.

It was in May 1750, at Williamsburg had been serving on the frontier, and on his way home to Mount Vernon, he stopped at the "White House" to rest.
