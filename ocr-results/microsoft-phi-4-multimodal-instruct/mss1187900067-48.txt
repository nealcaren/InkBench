feel what I am growing old,
and not now what I have
been - although time bees
me - you will see by
this letter that it hardens
for me to write now then
in old times when my
necessities were steady
and strong - Give my
kind regards to your
wife in which my good wishes
heartily joins.  Believe this
hastily written note and 
believe me ever your
friend and well wisher
James R. Bishop

Ruth says, come and see
us - I day Knows.  You have
now an engagement not 
fulfilled. Jor. R. B.
