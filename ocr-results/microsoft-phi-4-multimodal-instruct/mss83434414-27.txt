FREEDMEN'S BUREAU.

General Rufus Saxton had, as you are aware, been during most of the war in charge of matters pertaining to freedmen in South Carolina. The operations of the war enabled me to visit Beaufort and St. Helena islands during the winter of 1864–65, and I was pleased with the settlement, labor, regulations, and thriving schools that I found in existence under his direction and supervision. Several armies were received by him, which have been before described as following our armies, were received by him, for the most part, in a state of utter destitution, distributed upon different vacant lands, and cared for until they became self-sustaining.

Colonel Osborne, judging by his past success of the general's fitness for a work, I gave to the Assistant Commissioner for the latter State, Florida temporarily, a serious accident, while en route to his post, which detained him in extending his months. Owing to sickness, General Saxton was delayed in extending his organization into the interior. A few officers and agents, however, proceeded as early as June to Augusta and a few west in Georgia. Lately, South Carolina and Georgia have been completely organized. From South Carolina reports from the interior of the State are replete with instances of violence and defrauding of the freedmen—murders, whipping, tying up by the thumbs, defrauding of wages, over-working, combining for purposes of extortion &c. From my own observation, I do not infer that such crimes and cruelties give a true picture of the State of society. Yet the criminal list is altogether too great to pass unnoticed. Already the antagonism between whites and blacks in this State is marked, and for the sake of peace and good order it would be unwise to attempt to withdraw the military force. The number of dependents drawing rations in South Carolina and Georgia, at the end of September, was 10,663; the number of schools, 114; number of teachers, 174; of scholars, 9,500.

A very large number of contracts were made for last year by the military authorities, none by the Bureau. Those planters who people on credited of General Sherman’s men have been obliged to struggle against many difficulties. They complain of a scarcity of laborers, who will not work for a United States government price. These contractors, with their own laborers, furnish nearly all the crop.

SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA.

On the 18th of July, 1865, I assigned Colonel William Dwight, commissary of subsistence, to the Army of Georgia, to assume command of the Freedmen’s Bureau for South Carolina and Georgia, with the further instruction to organize it for Florida as soon as practicable for that purpose.

Colonel Dwight, however, soon after, was ordered to report to the Commander of the Department of the South; and on the 25th of July I assigned Major General Saxton to command the Freedmen’s Bureau for South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. He was, therefore, commanded to take charge of the Bureau for the three States and to put it in efficient operation.

He has been acting in that capacity up to the present time. In South Carolina, he has been compelled to exert the military force to protect the freedmen who were generally exposed to violence and oppression. He has issued numerous proclamations, orders, and instructions to regulate the labor relations between masters and servants; and he has, since my last report, increased the number of schools, teachers, and scholars, and has, in many instances, furnished books ornament in which have been inspected.

The freedmen are generally industrious, faithful, and obedient to their masters.
