East Rochester, N.Y., Aug 17, 1897—

Friend Douglas,

I started from Rochester yesterday
morning & strung a pocket Hebrlok instrument
tonight at 6 o’clock. I was in the swamps
a few rods north of the Rush Reservoir.
I attached a communication with the person
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your
postal card. Before I left home I read
your telegram, & went to the Rock. Saw. Bt.
Where the raft was prepared and notified
them of its non-receipt, and your wish
for a duplicate. They said that they
could not give another until they had
meeting this of form the clearing house
at my, which will be the first week
