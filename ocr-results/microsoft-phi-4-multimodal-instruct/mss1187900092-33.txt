quite anxious to see both. That is
one of the greatest difficulty about
this place, I am unable to keep up
with current events unless the pa-
pers are sent from home, and I
miss reading the daily papers very
much.

Hoping that I have not put your
eyes to a very severe test I and that
you will favor me with an early
reply, I will close, with much love.

Yours aff. grand-daughter,
Battie.
