"that after a battle two hours they (the "Northern forces") went repulsed, leaving
"many dead and wounded, and this order
"and tranquility reigned in the South."

"We shall have on the 19th a cable of the
"Northern forces via Hatteras, and a cable on
"20th via Cuba and a maid again on the 25th
"oned." - I continue to believe that the
"things will continue to vieg and
"retreat to the North, proclaiming perhaps
"secession, and that the unfortunate plate
"of Government will continue 24 for months."

"If the Government of Cleveland and Harri-
"son had acted in good faith in their relation
"with Douglas, this war would not have
"lasted...." I ask myself, if it would ask
"be well for me to go to Port au Prince with
"Mr. Bourgeoise to see if the two parties continued
"ing count arrive at an honorable understanding."

Now, my dear Douglas, this letter is already
long; that I must cut it short right here.

My prayerly and very cordially yours,
Mrs. Bassett at Jetty,
Will write to Miss Bourgeoise.   E. Blount.
