toward the close of the war. The few days we lay in camp there witnessed the stirring and eventful scenes around Petersburg which culminated in Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, and saw General Joseph B. Johnson’s army retreating through North Carolina, followed by Sherman’s about the time we went into camp at Faison the battle of Bentonville was fought, probably not more than twenty-five miles from us.

While we lay in camp at Faison Station an incident occurred which in its result was quite important to me; and if it was so unique in its character that I deem it worth relating briefly. Had the result not known when no enemy was near we kept a good picket line, for we did coming at unexpected times, and the Confederates had a habit of holding upon us with a tenacity and experience had taught us the necessity of constant vigilance. We were short of lieutenants, and I found myself detailed one morning to do a lieutenant’s place on the picket line. At the same time that the Adjutant had been detailed as brigade officer of the day. I don’t know that he had been detailed as brigade straight in the transaction, but I felt at the time all was right and imposed upon. Officers in the army lay much stress on rank, and when I saw myself detailed to do a lieutenant’s duty on the picket line, and the captain of another company going out as brigade officer of the day, I thought I was not receiving fair treatment, and so in formed the adjutant, using pretty strong language. But my hot words didn't change matters any, and we went out just as we were detailed.

I was in charge of the men from our regiment, and fortune so arranged matters that we were placed directly opposite the headquarters of General Terry, then commanding our corps, and not more than thirty or forty rods from his tent. Soon after we went on duty Captain Riley, brigade officer of the day, came along the line, and in addition to giving me some general directions, instructed me specially that no person be allowed to pass any portion of his picket line held by his men. He asked me if I understood, and in the case, I asked him our he was sure of his men, and asked him about it. He said he had not mistaken, and the order as he knew to me was exactly as he had received it from the division commander, and the order was to be obeyed, and I took it as such.

Shortly after that, a man came along toward Terry’s headquarters dressed in a tattered gray uniform and bearing a flag of truce, and reported to me that he wanted to pass through our line to see General Terry, and deliver a message. I told him I had orders not to let anyone pass, and I could not do it. He insisted that he had a very important message to deliver, and that it concerned General Lee and General Terry. I told him if that was the case, he would have to wait until I got orders from my superior officer. "Well," he said, "I reckon that’s the way it is." I then asked him who he represented, and he said he was a courier from General Lee. I inquired as to the nature of his message, and he replied that it concerned the surrender of the rebel army.
