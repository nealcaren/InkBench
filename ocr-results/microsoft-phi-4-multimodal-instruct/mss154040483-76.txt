THE WOMAN CITIZEN


THE question for our consideration is whether the department of Election Laws and Methods is a sufficiently important part of the work of the League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less appealing to many women than it is to men because it is more necessary for women voters to comprehend this need. If another department for example Women should be dropped for example Reform, for the necessary Women responsible for the necessary arrange-ments were before there reforms. The Women Voters; but if the political department of women voters, but for partner, that is, of the political are very much at length and there is no other department of the failure to register the people’s wishes everywhere. The people asked for by our readers.

The here is the address made by Mrs. Catt at the Cleveland Convention when, in response to a motion to abolish this department, the Committee on Election Laws and Methods called Efficiency in Government.

“It is an expression of the trouble of our governmental machinery to register the people’s wishes, because there is a conflict between the state and the nation and political machines and bosses. 

Reform, therefore, is needed all along. It is needed in the election of the President of the United States and all the way down to the dog-catcher in the smallest village. 

Where We Need Reform.
Perhaps we need it most in our platform-making. Ours is a country of tremendous power in this land, so tremendous that it is hard to imagine a problem of great magnitude that the United States cannot solve. 

Here is the chairman called in by the League of Women Voters, but for that reason, the many women interested in it in support. 

There is also the autocracy of what is known as the boss system to be watched. It is one on which change must be brought about. It is so widespread that being odd the world not to frankly say that this cannot be done by politicians. 

I know that there are many opponents of popularity throughout the country. The last generation is turned loose; therefore, is it not more fitting that the 1920 vote be non-partisan? I feel that so. 

But if this is done, it would restrict the entrance to the “opinions” that very many of them felt would vary, that there are any citizens, if the ballot should be put the question of women voters in the political machines already mentioned. 

The question, therefore, is this: Shall we speculate, or shall we prove?

I think we can succeed as a set of women.

I think we ought to strike out these promises and just let it be.  There is the satisfaction of knowing that we are the women who were the agents for reconstruction. 

“These were two questions only in that campaign and there were many others. To register the opinions that were expressed in that election would vary so very much that if the vote had been organized by games, it would probably be driven very much by the campaign which had happened over and over again. 

Presumably, the program was that of the unique interests in any neighborhood, for that is usually supported.”  Coverna
