Petition for the Immediate Enlargement of the Right of Suffrage.

The Legislature of the State of New-York having, by the Acts of 1848 and 1849, testified the purpose of the People of this State to place Married Women on an equality with Married Men in regard to the holding, conveying, and devising of real and personal property.

We, therefore, the undersigned Petitioners, inhabitants of the State of New-York, male and female, having attained the age of legal majority, believing that women, like men, are entitled to all civil and political rights and privileges, and desiring to do earnestly request, to do still suffer and endure under a slavery! We pray to appoint a joint committee of both Houses to examine the laws of New-York, and to propose such amendments as will secure to the Citizens of the State of Women equal rights and privileges with Men, and thereby ask our occurred representatives.



Petition for Womanâ€™s Suffrage.

Whereas, according to the Declaration of our National Independence, Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, we earnestly represent to the Legislature of the State of New-York, that it is the right of all citizens to participate in the formation of the laws by which they are to be governed, and we do respectfully urge to enable women to exercise this sacred right.
