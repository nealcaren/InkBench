form. Four days after he wrote to a broadside as well as in pamphlet form. To Arms! He published it as a broadside: as well as in pamphlet form. Four days after he wrote to Gerrit Smith as:
"I have thought much of your letter to Mr. May, expressing the wish that we should send at least one colored company of soldiers from the State of New York to make part of the regiment now forming at Readville, Massachusetts. At first I saw some ground for hesitation. Subsequent reflection and consultation with our friend George L. Stearns from Boston have convinced me that your suggestion should be carried out. I have therefore already set myself to the work of raising at least one company in this state to be a part of the first colored regiment of Massachusetts. I have visited Buffalo and obtained seven good men. I spoke here, Ithaca, Troy and Albany and other places in the state till, get one hundred men. Charley my youngest son was the first to put black soldier that he shall not rise to the company. It is a little cruel to say to the advertised colored men should have an officer of the United States what-ever may be the hazard, but I shall be the opportunity of getting on the United States uniform as a very great advantage. I sent you a few days here, and is having a good effect... I shall be in Syracuse on Wednes-day for the purpose of getting men for this company, and in Troy on Thursday, Friday in Albany. I shall go to New York and at the request of Mr. Stearns go to Philadelphia revisit the enlistments there. Returning from Philadelphia I shall revisit the places named and make calls at others in the State, for the purpose of accommodating those who wanted time to decide."

In March, 1855, Frederick Douglass delivered an address to the New York State Legislature. An eyewitness (William H. Topp, of Albany) describes the crowded audience, and their rapt attention to the speaker, as the greatest scene he ever witnessed in the Capitol. Among those whose eyes were riveted on the speaker full two hours and a half were Woodruff, Weed and Lieutenant Governor Root, lying and at the fore were fifteen or twenty conservative legislators; the crowd:

(1) Lieutenant Governor Root
(2) Hon. Clark Balch
(3) Hon. Milford Montgomery and web
(4) Senator Wright
(5) Senator Beward
(6) Hon. Francis Moore
