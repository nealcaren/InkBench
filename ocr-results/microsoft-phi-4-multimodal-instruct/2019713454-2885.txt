EDITOR'S PORTFOLIO.

We have received a number of let-
ters from young correspondents who
are getting subscribers for us, and
getting at the same time handsome
prizes for themselves. (See page 3 of
cover). One little girl sent three sub-
scribers, and she sent her a silver
furbank knife. We then notice she will
like another to present to her dear
grandmother; so she sent three more.
Mrs. Lowell advertises a “literary
gift girl wanted, a croquet set, and
so on twenty full subscribers. Others
have us twelves, books, note-paper, &c.
We’ll gently readers help to
establish “THE NURSERY” propers
to end another similar work?

*To obtain a set of pinetrees,
postage stamps, 10c.

*For Illustrations see pages 70, 77,
88, 90.



“What Landseer is to dogs, what Mor-
land is to pigs, what Honiers is to
Dutch boors, Oscar Pletsch is to chil-
dren — their painter, interpreter, im-
mortalizer. It has been a superior, and
probably not an equal, in his specialty
of sketching children. For presenting
the American public with the display
ings of this admirable artist, Mrs.
Seaverns deserves the thanks of all
lovers of Pletsch’s genius, — his humor,
truth, geniality, and beauty, — get a set
of his “Nursery” and carefully exam-
ine the scenes. Keeping School” - A
Hand-Kissing, The Professor; a Body
Hard, Day's Work. - I’ve Been A
Maying, Can't You Come Obtain
a “Nursery” now, and get acquainted
with Pletsch's children.
