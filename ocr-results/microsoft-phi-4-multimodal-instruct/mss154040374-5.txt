Concerning Request of Books

Mrs. Mary R. Beard,
New Milford, Conn.

Dear Mrs. Beard:

I am only trying to fill in some deficiencies before I arrived in this world that I have never seen and I am sure they would not in the women in fragileasts must have had some of these books and I am trying to chase them down. 

When and if I am able to complete my collection what to do with them. 

I am very glad you got as good a start as you have. I think that our American history should remain in this country, but the women in Amsterdam have had such a remarkable start that I think their archives will turn to be of great authority and importance in Europe. A bountiful space, for which there is no charge for rent.

I shall make no disposition of my collection until I have consulted you.

Sincerely,

CC: HW.
