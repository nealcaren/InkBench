FREEDMEN’S BUREAU.

The friends of the freedman claim for him a right of intellectual brain equal to his white fellow-man. A number of the medical officers interested in the cause are, when opportunity offers, many interesting statistics will be added to the archives of the Bureau.

The officers of the medical staff in charge of the districts are entitled to great credit for efficient administration of medical affairs, a result anticipated from the facilities made by these staff departments of the Bureau has relieved embarrassment and encouraged me in my official labors.

In concluding this report I beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the record at times afforded by the Commissioner to the medical branch of the Bureau. 

Calvin W. Horner,
Surgeon United States Volunteers, Chief Medical Officer.

The breaking up of the old plantation system has necessarily left the sick in the ordinary means of self-support, they will doubtless secure the necessary aid.

The medical officers of this Bureau at the best can afford but partial relief.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Of justice.—As all matters relating to refugees and freedmen were committed to my supervision and management by the law, and as the old void codes in several insurrectionary States had become practically null and old civil so far as they related to the negro. It became necessary to lay down some general rule for the officers of the Bureau.

§ VI. Simple good faith, for which we hope on all hands from those concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve the Assistant Commissioners in the discharge of their duties towards the freedmen, as well as promote the general welfare. The Assistant Commissioners will, everywhere, declare and allow Congress, 

The laws of those States where there is an in violation of civil law, or in which the proclamation by reason of old codes, in the interpretation of freedmen, or by rigorously interpreting State laws to the prejudice of the freedmen, exercise their authority to settle and adjust such questions, as a court of equitable jurisdiction. 

As others, any proceedings of a court-martial, or of any military board, so far as they relate to the enforcement of these regulations, shall be subject in all cases to the approval of the Commissioner. 

§ VII. The medical officers of the Bureau will, as far as practicable, make friendly suggestion to loyal citizens, and to those trained in the medical profession, for the advantage of the freedmen.

§ VIII. All questions relating to the claim of the freedmen for wages previously earned, and to the settlement of accounts between the freedmen and their former masters, will be referred to the proper authority for decision.

§ IX. The freedmen should be encouraged to work for wages, and to enter into lawful contracts. All contracts made by freedmen with their former masters, or with others, and which are contrary to law, or unjust to the freedmen, should be disregarded. 



§ X. The medical officers of the Bureau will see to it that no humane person will be denied medical attendance for a long time, and they will give all the relief in their power. 



§ XI. To do anything that would be considered in Opposition to the civil authority. 



§ XII. The medical officers will look out that no assistant or employés under their direction treat the freedmen with neglect, or disrespect. 



§ XIII. The medical officers are authorized to approve of medical attendance and medical establishments by ante-bellum physicians, who are reliable and reputable.
