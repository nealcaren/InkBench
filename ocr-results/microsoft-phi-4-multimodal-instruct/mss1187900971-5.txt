Grandpa was never called "Lloyd".
He was first Frederick Farley, the slave
changed to Johnson when he ran
away and because the man in
whose home he lived was named Bedford
was named Johnson, Thomas
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admires
Frederick Lincoln, wrote
Franceira to keep from conflicting
their two Johnsons, heartily
would like to call himself
Douglas instead of Johnson said.
Grandpa told him one name to
was as good as another and hence
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass.
These facts - not hearsay.

Later – first read letter from Fred – he
leaves on his “debating tour” today –
and really debates at Harvard. He
will stop with Fred’s. We already met
Foe’s wife and aunt and Aunt Crawford.
