Mr. Blackwell:-

Dear Mr. Blackwell:-

I pondered over your letter and I cannot
see my duty in the matter. If I thought you might let me I could
be of any particular aid in Utah. I will try and feel
the pulse of things there; I began to feel worried about
it myself, and I am not at all sure that I can understand the status
of the question there. The reports in the newspapers are
often times so garbled that it is impossible to tell what is the
truth. We are greatly handieapped by not having any Gentiles to 
write to. I am very sure I could never convert the Editor of the
Salt Lake Tribune, if he is in truth opposed to it. A conversion
must be a growth. I think it is almost impossible to make friends
out of an enemy. If you hear of anything that gives you any clue
to the question thesis there I hope you will let me know. If it
so happens that by my going there I could do good, I am sure I will
very gladly go. I am,

Yours sincerely,

Carrie Chapman Catt.
