PRESS RELEASE: For PMs, Thursday, March 30.

The Thompson Cafeteria at 725 14th St., N.W., is to be prosecuted by the DC corporation counsel for violation of the 1872 and 1896 laws against discrimination cutting attorney. The complaining witnesses on whose complaint Mr. King is acting are:

Harry Church Terrell — for two terms a member of the D.C. Board of Education;

David H. Scull — Member of the Society of Friends. 

Rev. Arthur F. “Imes — Pastor of the Peoples Congregational Church.

Miss Essie Thompson — member of the Peoples Restaurant Workers Union.

The witnesses were refused service at the Thompson cafeteria on Feb. 28, 1950 on the ground that three of the group were colored, by Mr. S.W. Becker, regional superintendent of the Washington-Baltimore district of the Thompson chain.

According to a ruling of the corporation counsel, the law against discrimination for color in restaurants is now in effect, but no further prosecutions will be enacted upon, although complaints will be accepted for future prosecution, until the courts have ruled on the Thompson case. Some restaurants have opened their doors to all patrons since the Thompson announcement on Feb. 21, 1950, through the corporation counsel, that the law is still in effect. The Washington Restaurant Assn. has advised its members not to obey the law at present.

An anxious curious brief will be filed by the Coordinating Committee for the D.C. chapter of the Natl. Lawyers Guild published an opinion in May 1949 holding that the laws have never been repealed, and has entered solely with their being put into effect.  The anxious brief reviews the changing and inconsistent segregation patterns in the nation upon which the citizen of the District of Columbia is tethered.

The attorney representing the Thompson chain will be:

Bradley & Bradley
1713 Vermont Ave. N.W.

The Thompson Cafeteria is being prosecuted because the owner refused to obey the laws of the District of Columbia. 

James Gould Thompson, co- proprietor of the Thompson chain, is also reported 
to have said he would not comply with the laws.

The Angle:

March 27, 1950—The Thompson Cafeteria is being prosecuted because it refused service to a group of four persons solely because of their race.  This is believed to be the first test case on the District of Columbia anti-discrimination laws of 1872 and 1893 will be tried in D.C. Court on Friday, March 31. The case, “Dist. of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co.”, will take place on the 2nd floor, Municipal Court, Criminal Division, 5th St. between F and Sts. N7, at 1:30 PM.
