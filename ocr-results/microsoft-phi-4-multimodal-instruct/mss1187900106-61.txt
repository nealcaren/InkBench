JOHNSON’S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Founded in 1859 by the American Colonization Society, Liberia, a republic on the western coast of Africa, is located 'twixt 6° and 9° N. lat., and 7° 27' and 8° 36’ W. longitude. It extends from a few miles north of Cape Palmas to 260 miles north. The coast is usually (though not always) bounded by dense mangroves and marsh grasses, yielding occasionally to a point where the mere sand begins to prevail. Extends 260 miles along the coast, and 200 miles into the interior, containing about 20,000 square miles, as estimated in 1890 at 11,350 square miles. Terrain is hilly and undulating, and rocky in high altitude, and in the interior the country is covered with rain forests.

Many streams flow to the ocean, but some of them vanish seemingly at the margin of the transited belt, and for the most important of the St. Paul's navigable for 15 miles. but beyond lies a low and shallow remnant of the lagoons. The largest export for any year is gum copal—although the shore is thoroughly tropical. The average heat in January and February is 88° F., rising in March to 90° F.; and in July, the average is 88 degrees. The country is perfectly adapted to the vegetated average heat is 76°, and the thermometer rarely exceeds 90 degrees. The high altitude and the north-easterly winds that occasionally pour rain from the… –, probably from another climate, such as its occasional heavy storms, never endangering it, suffices to render the towns rather healthy. The natives, on the contrary, are exposed to every extremes—now exposed to the torrid, now to the temperate, which renders them observant of the houses—the aboriginal habitations, which—are built—with steep pitched roofs that will allow the rain to be drained off.

They cultivate such produce as rice, cacao, coffee, ginger, kola, the various species of pepper, indigo, potatoes, taros, cassava, marketable, several species of sweet potatoes, beans, gourds, squash, maize, pines, yams honeysuckles, oranges, lemons, mangos, tangerines, egg plants, figs, pawpaws, melons, bananas, grapes, water melons, pineapples; lemons; vanilla, cassia, turmeric, allspice, oranges, tocarianles, vanilla, rose wood, the bamboo, the mahogany, kalinrood; cedar, aneuria gigantea, rice, benny-seeds, molasses, and lemons.  Many marketable, alluvial, clayey, and pliable soils from the mangroves. Various alluvial bottoms producing oranges, lemons, pineapples, and cocoa, besides some sweet-potatoes.

Wild animals include monkeys, lions, tigers, leopards, hyenas, civets, antelopes, elephants, baboons, parrots, squirrels. Ibis, pelicans, cranes, herons, wild pigeons, eagles, hawks, vultures, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, frogs, toads. The number of miles of rivers “navigable for more than an hour or two” is 3,433. The number of minerals has not been determined. The products of Liberia have increased in value from $120,204 in 1877 to $347,743 in 1895.

Educated native intelligence is not sufficient to supply the civil domain, education has been somewhat neglected, but that has never been sufficient. The United States has made large donations for schools, but they have not been equal to supplying the demand.



The people are a mixture of various tribes, so the native monotype is, to many people’s view ever shifting. The various upper class people that have gone into the country during the last 65 years are, to a prevailing fate, illegitimate children. 
The slave exports, now and then from Liberia or Sierra Leone, has forever been a source of contention both to themselves and Americans.
