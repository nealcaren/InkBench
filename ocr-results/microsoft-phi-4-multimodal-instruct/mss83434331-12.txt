"(c) PREAMBLE.

WHEREAS, unconditional slavery exists to a fearful extent amongst us as a nation, in violation of those principles that molded us, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

WHEREAS, the aristocracy of the South are determined to perpetuate it by means scarcely less dreadful than the tortures of the Inquisition, and the {bastardly} aristocracy of the north are aiding their “chivalrous” comrades of the South in their inhuman endeavors by misrepresenting, flattering, and supporting those who are bold enough to explain the cause of universal freedom, and further by circulating publications and making speeches so higly unversial to excite mobs, an impel them to their ruthless work of terror and destruction.

WHEREAS, the crisis has arrived at which the descendants of our fathers must determine whether they will establish the abnormal and cowardly precedent of surrendering their most sacered rights to the nod of an arrogant domineering and self-constituted aristocracy, or in the spirit of their fathers manfully maintain them.

(d) ARTICULATION.

From the Cincinnati Gazette.

Some forty miles from Cincinnati, are two settlements of free negroes—probably near a thousand men, women and children, of the true ebony color & occupied very little with their own labors; their slender possessions, some of them, are “STEMMED” with a penny appearance made by stolen property—others have been too industrious to deal more than commonly with the inhabitants of the settlement; others, like the majority of late purchasers of slaves for them, and parceled out among them about fifteen years ago.

Their lands are not of the best quality of soil; but, by good management could yet be made very productive—they have had little experience in the improvement of lands, & are also not inclined to be industrious, so leaned, ignorant, & in some cases, they are. They have, however, a map of the settlement.

The neighborhood of these settlements proved a good safety valve to the anti-slavery feelings of the others and provided a place the oppressed slave may find a home when they have purchased their freedom may flee to when the master’s whip no longer shall claim them,

A committee to be selected to secure to them a location where they can become self-supporting, in which the climate is healthy and the soil fertile.
