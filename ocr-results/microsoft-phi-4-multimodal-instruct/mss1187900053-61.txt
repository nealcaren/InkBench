Dear Mrs. Douglas,

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you, and I heard from you, and
I looked now, in hopes of pro-
curing a reply. We really are
very much in the dark about
you, & do not even think whether
you write cold office under the
Government, as we have not been
by the contrary â€“ I conclude that you
do - & therefore that you must re-
turn before lobbying interests
is off old. I hope that your health
is good - that you can represent
well yourself & your family.
