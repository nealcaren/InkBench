My Dear Father.

I have received your
kind letter and ours.
Every place to hear
from you. but I am so
sorry that you feel
so a bout going to
Rochester, I hope it will
be all Right there.
When you go there. I
shall take good care of your
Color boys and I think of
discharging them in any way,
we have had a few very
good days we have here
more pleasant weather.
