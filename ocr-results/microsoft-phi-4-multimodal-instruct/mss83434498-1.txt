SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, APRIL 3, 1865. My dear, I wish with all the fervor of my soul I could write you a joyful, invigorating, with a brilliant and animating letter, but I cannot. I am surrounded by such depressing influences that i find it difficult to be cheerful. We are ordered to Mobile, and the troops are already moving. The soldiers speak of nothing but “going to see the rebels bleed” and similar disgusting talk. I receive a letter from Mother today. It is a good letter. It will do me a world of good to feel that she is as well as she is and as cheerful as can be. I am so terrified of change! I love this place despite its horrors, because I feel I am doing some good here. What will I do when I am taken away from here? Where will I go?

Deputy Commissary, 17th U.S. Infantry, “B” Battery, came in today and requested that I ccopy (for him) letters to his family as well as create descriptive detail of hospital operations at the facility. I am doing my best to satisfy him. Have been very busy hence, a fairly arduous day. Acting Infirmary in charge, Army and Navy. Col. Magill.

I hoped this place would be my swan song for military work but now, things take on a new order. We went into the fort the 27th last month and have been here ever since. We have no mostancy water, no system of sorts. Our supplies are only 12 miles off. We are fed yesterday with several barrels of poor quality, rations. So we moved to the depot. There are 13,000 “Freeman” here. “The rebels have eaten all the fodder,” one says, “they’ve scattered the potatoes.” and so on. Our regiment, of course, takes on our share of the responsibility. "E" Co. of our regiment is encamped at the depot, so far. Our train which has followed us seems to be still lagging nearly ninety miles behind. “We started to weed this place, a few weeks ago, raised white, red and black beans.” Our men are quite patient. They’ve learned to wait. How pleasant it would be to see them vole: and to read their ebullient sense of joy. How do we know that they are just? They say that the rebel leaders placed poisoned corn up along the railroad track.

We’ve just heard that our relief company is coming fast. It seems only yesterday that we landed and now our end is near. Don’t write to me my dear, unless you can write with good cheer. Good-bye.



I remain,
Your affectionate, C.A.H.
