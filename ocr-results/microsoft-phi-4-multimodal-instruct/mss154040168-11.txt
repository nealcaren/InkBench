I am longing to hear when I am again at 
home, here and when. I am beginning 
as a mild and Reynard Sam presides 
over my list the maid I need you then
Panama after I'm thankful for you
here the best companion when I arrive. 
Letters are already where I sought you here.

this boat to N. Y. but put it in my

in store. Lovingly, C.C.
