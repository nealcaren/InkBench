you may here already been - I've just - just below - struck me as particularly lovely.

I wonder if you knew the latest Dr. Emily Lewi presented a check for $14,000 to the trustees of the New York Infirmary to start an endowment fund in her memory.

Income will be used for the care of alling women physicians and their children.

The check was presented to Mrs. Frank Vanderbilt and other directors of the Infirmary, by Dr. Marion Mannister, medical director of the Infirmary, at the end of a meeting of the trustees in the Fuller Building, 997 Madison Avenue.

Mrs. Vanderbilt said of Dr. Lewis: “She was one of the great doctors who had the courage of their convictions and who dedicated herself to uphold the advanced service of women doctors, and in the hope and that of her associates the Infirmary would long continue its doors.”

Dr. Emily Lewi, who died two years ago, was a pediatrician who practiced more than thirty years and served as active pediatrician at the Infirmary from 1889 to 1928. She was known as an outstanding teacher and diagnostician and was one of the first women pediatricians.

One room in the projected New Infirmary building will be memorial room the Emily Lewi and the endowment will support it.
