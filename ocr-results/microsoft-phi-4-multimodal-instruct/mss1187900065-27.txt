To - The Probate Judge of Hudson County, N.J.
and Testamentary Custodian.

I enclose herewith the Last Will and Testament of the late City of Animals, otherwise known as Fam in the City of Paris, France, deceased on 21st January 1884. I have decided not to offer the same for probate, because I do not propose to qualify as Executor; but, in view of the fact of other persons having interests in the estate under the Will in question, I deem it my duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to your entertaining an application for administration on the estate with the will annexed.

It is my intention, however, that it is entitled to the property by the trust mentioned in the Will, and to claim the property to which it is entitled.

I have the honor to remain,
with most respect
Beryll Berch
President.
