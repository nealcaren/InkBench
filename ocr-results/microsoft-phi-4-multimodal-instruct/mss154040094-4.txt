I think that is quite conventional & seventeen year old boy. So if you could send it to me beforehand, I would be very happy indeed. 

Please remember me to Miss Wilson & Miss Pick and be sure to let me know if they or you come to Washington. 

With affectionate greetings. 

Gratefully yours, 
Honance H. Darly
