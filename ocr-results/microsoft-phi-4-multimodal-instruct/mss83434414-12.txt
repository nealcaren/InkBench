"VI. Brigadier General R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plantations, and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or desired in the policy now on Beaufort island, nor any rights to property theretofore acquired, be affected thereby."

"By order of Major General W. T. SHERMAN:"

"L. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant General.”

In Virginia quite an amount of land was libelled and about to be sold by the marshal just previous to the establishment of the bureau, when the sales were suspended by the Secretary of War, in order that these lands might be turned over to the bureau for the benefit of the freedmen. I claimed that these lands, which had been condemned to sale, though not actually sold, were already the property of the government, and objected to his excellency doing President against the insertion of the word “sold” in the definition of confiscated property. The President referred the matter to the Attorney General, whereupon—

This decision necessitated the restoration of all the property where the sale had been suspended. I have been very desirous of conforming to the letter of the law, in setting apart lands, but was unwilling to do so before it became probable that we could be certain in this way much disappointment and suffering would be avoided.

The freedmen were so eager for the possession of land, and so likely, without that possession in fact or in prospect, to be obliged to leave their present homes, that I made the following proposition through yourself:

BUREAU OF REFUGEES, FREEDMEN, AND ABANDONED LANDS,
Washington, September 4, 1865.

SIR: The matter of imposing some conditions in the cases of pardoning those who have been presented to me by the Attorney General, for the benefit of this class of persons, having distinguished officer of the army, which I heartily endorsed, I deem it best to suggest a die-cussed some other funding props, as to wit;
1st. That hereafter pardons of the President of the United States, extended to those who have been excepted in the proclamation of May 29, 1865, having more than 20,000 dollars' worth of property, be conditioned by specific stipulation that each individual case: that the land owned by such person shall be permanently transferred to the use of freedmen.
2d. That all parties so pardoned, shall be required to execute a bond, with satisfactory surety, in double the amount of land transferred, conditioned for the faithful fulfillment of the terms here provided.
3d. That the hands of the freedmen be protected against sudden abandonment, and that they be allowed a reasonable time to gather their crops, and to otherwise reduce their crops, and to otherwise improvo their condition, before they be required to remove.
4th. That the officers of the Bureau, in the respective districts where these stipulations and bonds shall be executed, be charged with the supervision of the freedmen thus settled, and with the settlement of all controversies between them and their former owners.
5th. That the power to enforce these stipulations and to recover the penalties for their violation bere vested in the Bureau appropriate military.

I am, Sir, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
L. M. DAYTON, Asst. Adj. Gen.”
