strongly opposed secession. When the rest of the Western counties overwhelmingly in a statewide referendum on May 23, 1861, to withdraw from the Federal Union, the “loyal western residents, in a series of conventions at Wheeling, voted to “secede” from Virginia and set up their own State. The bill for admission passed Congress on December 11, 1862, and on June 30, 1863, by Presidential proclamation, West Virginia became the 35th State.

For years, however, many Jefferson County residents refused to use “West” as part of the designation.

Harpers Ferry never recovered from the devastation of the Civil War. Starting at the stark chimneys and charred remains of once impressive buildings, one of the townspeople concluded: “This place will never be anything again unless the Government rebuilds the armory—and it is doubtful if that is ever done.” The Government never did, and the ground on which it stood was auctioned off in 1869. Mills and factories remained closed. The railroad did a small percentage of its previous business. Hopes for a renewal of the many former properties were dashed in 1870 when a flood destroyed or badly damaged nearly every building on Virginius Island and along the south side of Shenandoah Street. Subsequent floods destroyed still more of the town and ruined the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The canal was finally abandoned after the flood of 1924.

Inundated too often by high water, the residents of Harpers Ferry eventually left the old buildings in the lower town and moved up the heights to the high ground of Camp Hill and toward Bolivar. For years the old shops and stores, those that remained, stood empty, neglected, and deteriorating. When Harpers Ferry became a national historical area, the National Park Service began an intensive campaign to preserve the fragile remains of the 18th- and 19th-century industries, homes, churches, stores, and shops, and to restore much of the old town to its pre-Civil War appearance, a time when it was at its peak as a thriving, bustling industrial community and transportation center.

Today, while much of the old historical town remains, few of the structures that figured prominently in John Brown’s raid survive. (See maps on pp. 29 and 30.) The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridge across the Potomac, on which Brown and his raiders entered Harpers Ferry in October 1859, was destroyed by Confederate soldiers at the Civil War. More modern structures have taken the river way, nearly obliterating the location of Brown’s attack. The Armory is gone; only its lower foundations remain. 

Of the buildings that survive, few are quite as noteworthy as the Boyd House, a sturdy stone property dated 1800, that served as a refuge for John Brown, attorney for the defense in the subsequent trial, and as the site of a lively meeting of the original republican party in 1855. 



The original brick armory, an impressive steel-reinforced structure, was opened in 1850, and at the time of the raid contained a seemingly impenetrable arsenal of 2,000 muskets.
