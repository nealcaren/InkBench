Dear Miss Blackwell,

I hope you are blessed with a
quieting to always at something. You
are something; still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three successive
spistiae might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do. The truth is, hot beyond
cred to say nothing of deed. What resource
was left but you. The other sewing, so to see
spoken of in we are having done this and that
as nurse in the war, I was called on to advise
her. Good to say, I admire what she did.
But must she not be a able woman to do
so much. Then I said to my well for me
upon and she to so some good. So the
only recommendation we can have, But really
I look to see one who has creed to
turn no further, but you were alluded to
Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
