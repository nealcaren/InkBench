Lynn, Mass. Dec. 1,1888
Editor Woman's Journal,
$2.50, which I send to
pay for the Woman's Journal, to
be sent to my address for one
year. I have hitherto received
the paper through a friend, but
I think I will have one of my
own now, so that I can have
some to give away.

I received your letter last
Monday, and I wish to thank
you for your evidently careful
perusal of my manuscript, and
for your friendly criticism of
my work. I feel more encouraged
by your commendations
