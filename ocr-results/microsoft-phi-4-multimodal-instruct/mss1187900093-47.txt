as lectures in Washington-
I know. I will write to you
then. It is my letter of inquiry-
I have gone again on a long 
journey to Buffalo. If I do so
cannot help being glad as thou
art a good many reasons why-
both as “Business of lettering” would
have written as formerly. I should
not have so long postponed my
inquiries - but I am obliged
to curtail my letters both as to
number of length -
I hope that it will turn
out that you are to pass the 
Winter in your pleasant and
comfortable home - Mry. I should
not dare the terrors of the
Baying also and many inconveniences
that you would have when 
you are quiet and comfortable-
Then I must send you pairs thee
We allow you – Both of you -
I was glad to hear & you
sure that you enjoy it - your 
experience very interesting and
valuable - that them for
him it is “a doubt sided” his
hands full of lettering worse
about which you can assist
him if you have not all that
you can do yourself-
I shall write to Miss. Britton
18-day and tile has all that 
I know of you movements in
Washington are his also on the road
to Ponte-one-Privée -
Great Mental the Douglas is to incite
a great thirst in you- and to see
but his waning tears –

said with.
