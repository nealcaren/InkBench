ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to secure a medical degree and another was the first to carry the degree into practice as a physician. Alice Stone Blackwell, daughter of Lucy Stone, herself pre-eminent among the early Massachusetts woman suffragists, to college become a lecturer against the laws and combats of women to be denied right to choose their occupations, was considered an "oddity" and throughout her life one of the half-dozen great women figures in the movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to the life of the cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from childhood on with the varied activities of the mother. Miss Blackwell was assistant or editor-in-chief of *The Woman’s Journal* for thirty-four years, President of the New England Woman Suffrage Association for many years, and President of the New York State Woman’s Suffrage Association. As editor-in-chief of *Woman’s Journal*, she developed a high reputation for her work of editing the Woman’s Journal and writing articles making a clear and convincing statements accomplished as an educator and a public frontier woman. Among journalists she was regarded as an editor of outstanding polish. In the council chambers she applied her rich wisdom, vast information, fertile mind. 

The instant the battle was won, she took up the task of educating and organizing the women of the nation, the Women's Auxiliary to the American Irish Bowling League, defining women's suffrage associations. Miss Blackwell, with her thorough knowledge of Humanity imbued with a deeply centered training, coupled with years of practice taught her how to inspire affection and esteem that enabled her to arrange a limited reception.

Throughout those long years her sensitive humanity has made her responsive to consider other struggles against oppression. Author of the 1917 American invitations to consider international peace, she, and others, recently dared to suggest varied efforts to win public understanding and support she rendered into English verses: “Armenia Poems”. Her devotion to Armenia was mirrored by her bitter sentiments, and through her lectures, news articles and published poems, she made her readers embrace her.

Alice Stone Blackwell wrote a textbook entitled "A Brief History of the Woman Suffrage Movement in the United States.” It has been thoroughly used in colleges, schools and lyceums.

She was the author of the biography, “Lucy Stone, her life and work” a volume which has been widely acclaimed by critics. 

Miss Blackwell’s ability to see the illogical and the injustice and her handsomely warring eloquence made her a great orator. She served as devoted, faithful member of more than a score of organizations and committees for many years.
