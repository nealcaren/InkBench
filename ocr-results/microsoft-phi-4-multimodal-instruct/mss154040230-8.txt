I have had several interviews with the Minister of Foreign Relations, Señor Honorio Pueyrredón and his secretary, in which the following has been established: the Argentine government is not able to name an official delegate, which here would be considered as the Charge d’Affaire of the United States, Baltimore is not official, that is, it is not organized by the government of the United States. This is clearly established by the note of Nov. 28, 1921, a copy of which has been officially sent to me, - delivered to the Charge d’Affaire of the United States, Mr. Fracia Wlute, in which he, “In transmitting this invitation to the government of your excellency, I must draw your attention to the fact that the invitation is not official, in that it emanates from a private organization; and that, although the Government of the United States sees with pleasure all conferences and following this, it was told me that he had shown much interest in our last conversation, insisting to the Minister that the affair be settled.

In view of the Congress not being official, the only thing which fix our Minister of Foreign Relations can do is to communicate through diplomatic channels, that is to say officially; - thus delegate of the Congress of Baltimore
