Dear Frederick Douglass

When we first saw you
appointed to Hoyt, we all had
many fine ideas and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you
& began to clip articles than with
the intention of “lotto” them, but alas!
to put I cut “lots” of editorial scraps
& the huge piles of collected scraps
they have all dissolved but three
& I purchase. 
Pleasant to see the
9 & not sure whether as glad
to hear you Ed. We need you
here.
