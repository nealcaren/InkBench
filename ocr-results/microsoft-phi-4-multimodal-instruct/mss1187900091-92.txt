My dear Douglas:

On my passage from New York yesterday from Phila. &
spoken on Friday evening, I called at New
Haven S.C. Office for news about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is that the clerks
said the office around my:

The steamer is the "Orange Nassau".
She will sail from Pierpoint Jones (along
side of the Yale street ferry,) Brookline,
on Friday next, 4th instant, at noon, for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on the
information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the
"Orange Nassau" is the poorest steamer of the
line. But she is steamable and sound and 
guess we can stand it for six days on board &
