82 CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.

sedes the civil power; and on this account I should have been obliged to vote, as I have said, against one of the resolutions of my excellent friend from Ohio, (Mr. Giddings,) or should at least have required that it be amended in conformity with the constitution of the United States.”

CONCLUSION.

It has thus been proved, that by the law and usage of modern civilized nations, confirmed by the judgment of eminent statesmen, and by the former practice of this government, that the President, as commander-in-chief, has the authority, as an act of war, to liberate the slaves of the United States have in former times sanctioned the liberation of slaves even of loyal citizens, by military commanders, in time of war, without compensation therefor; and I have deemed slaves captured in war from belligerent subjects as entitled to their freedom.*

* GENERAL WAR POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT. It is not intended in this chapter to explain the general war powers of the President. They are principally contained in the Constitution, Art. II. Sect. 1, Cl. 1 and 7; Sect. 2, Cl. 1; Sect. 3, Cl. 1; and in Sect. 1, Cl. 1, and necessary implication in Art. I. Sect. 9, Cl. 2. By Art. II. Sect. 2, the President is made commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States when called into the service of the United States. This clause gives ample powers of the war to the President, when the army and navy are lawfully in “actual service.” His military authority is supreme, under the constitution, while governing and regulating the land and naval forces, and treating captures on land and water in accordance with such rules as Congress may have passed in pursuance of Art. I, Sect. 8, Cl. 11, 14. Congress, or to effectively con-trol the military powers, may refuse troops, and by impeachment of the President; but for the general movement of the war, -the President is responsible to no other department of the government. His duty is to uphold the constitution, and enforce the laws, and to respect whatever rights loyal citizens are entitled to enjoy in time of civil war, to the fullest extent that may be consistent with the performance of modifying duty imposed on him. “The effect of a state of war, changing or mod-ifying the constitution at the will of the President would be altogether incompat-ible with the extent of the military power of the President under this chapter. For it is not at any at one time or another said at the time of war that the President may then do any thing, or even at any given moment, that he is not authorized to do when the war ceases.”



“The power of detaining and punishing rebels in re-bellion, act of war, suspend the human rights of citizens, or to deprive them of any right guaranteed to them by the Constitution, during the war.”
