THE AMUSING HISTORY
OF
THE GREATEST RASCAL IN NEW YORK.

Embracing His numerous Starts in Life, Funny Adventures, repeated Rogueries, the Honers he Enjoyed, his high Standing in Society and a Thousand Examples of the Profound Respect in which clever Villainy that grows Rich is held by the laity, clergy, police, Judges, and others in authority as well as by
THE PEOPLE AT LARGE.
