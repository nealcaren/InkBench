Near Erect Stonegulph
Offering for America
Weymouth Mass. 86 Years of age, beside the following
Offering for the Lincoin Monument Monumental erection.
"Father Abraham's monument!"

This Monument would seem to say
that Lincoin is dead, but tied to.
In vain the abuse aimed to slow
In vain the vile attempt to kill
In our own hearts his living race.
And while a chop of patriotic blood
Shall flow in any human frame
twice thrice at Memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoin 
This monument we raise to thee
Great Chief whose mandate Made us free
Our grateful hands to Heaven ascends
For thee, our hero and constant friend.
Also the following.
“Accept to America Personified”
The Word is gaping on thee.
Dispose thy votes with care
And with thy precious jewels
A crown thy golden hair.
