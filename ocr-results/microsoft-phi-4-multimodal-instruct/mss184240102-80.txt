Friday Mar 8

My dear friend.

I sent B.K. - because I
considered you were to
be there at first.  What time
lost I couldn’t have
met you. I was sick
for as was. Miss S.J. was very
much disappointed too
but so glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
& did take all care, partly
self, for what felt like to
be. But – rather – rather
we if it was one long summer
