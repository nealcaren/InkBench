There were many pleasant things to diversify the hard- brighten the narrow years of hard work.

Louise Alcott, then at the height of her popularity, wrote in reply to a request for her help:

Concord, Oct. 1, 1872.

Dear Mrs. Stone:
I am so busy just now that I have no time to help "Woman's Right to Vote," I read your note aloud to the family, asking "What shall I say to Mrs. Stone?” A voice from the transcendental fog which usually obscures my honored father instantly replied, "Tell her you are ready to follow your leader, sure that you could not have a better one.” My brave old mother, with the ardor of many unquenchable days shining in her face, cried out, “Tell her I am seventy-three, but I mean to go to the polls before I die, even if my three daughters have to carry me.” And two little men, we will let you vote as much as ever you like.

Such being the temper of the small convention of which, I am now president, I cannot hesitate to say that, though I may not be with you in the body, I shall be in spirit, and as, ever, hopefully and heartily yours,
Louise M. Alcott.

Miss Alcott dropped in at the office of the Suffrage Association one day and left a check for a hundred dollars, saying that she had earned it before breakfast. In those days a hundred dollars was a large sum.
