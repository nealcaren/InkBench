Deas Mr & Chapman Lett

I just finished the superb book
on the great work you have
accomplished during your
wonderfully active life.
This book is a real inspiration
for all of us in every country
who was deeply moved by the pages
of your national work and
the meetings in Geneva, few of
which I was fortunate enough
