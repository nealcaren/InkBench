if you will but keep
the size of your own
Spirit turned within -
for it is there within
(not without) that the
true precious jewel of
truth & brightness is to
be found - & formed -
and clarified - you
will find it, & know
it and live it - and
all men & women will
see you lessen - 
heartfelt & so dear, 
Queen of Truth
