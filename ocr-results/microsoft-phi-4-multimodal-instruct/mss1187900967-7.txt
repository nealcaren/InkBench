were at your houses. I overthink
should you come, a fatherâ€™s house. 
find me in very pleasant company,
wish quite much as I have on Cedar
Hill.  Zehr very well adept at
the Clarinette and country.  I
note what you say of young
Coshe. I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
Feel as more loss than this to
know that he served France
like a man. Trick. She
did a good deal for him. That
is perhaps the trouble. Had she
done less than she would have 
released more thanks. Gratitude
is not a very manly feature 
feature of the Colored race.
