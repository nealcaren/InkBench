not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until it is line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should be high enough from the hand to allow a holder to be passed under its right side. 
Third, Criticize. Criticize the line written, by asking questions on each particular given as knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The errors lie, of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is curve, it may be curved the wrong way, or too much; if sloped, it is sloped too much, or too little; the turn will be incorrect, or too broad, or too narrow. Select one or two of the most prevalent faults, discovered by observation and by your own exercise, for correction, direct especial attention to them, and have one more line written that they may be corrected. Then criticize these same points, see how many have succeeded in correcting them; and write one more line. Thus, criticize the execution of each line, and direct attention to the correction of fault after fault until the whole is perfected.
GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches both the base and head lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the curves, the oval for the base lines, the ovals, the oval or obliques, at 6 and 7, and the second curves written upwards. 4. The Connecting Lines are the connecting lines. Sometimes the curves written upwards. The Turns unite to connecting Lines. Sometimes the line formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into another at the middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 4. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are six Principles in the small letters; in order in which they occur in the Principles. There are six Principles in the capital letters; from these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts, all the small letters are made. 6. The red lines mark the columns, each of which is divided into three oblongs or boxes. 
Write down the columns till full.  The m. s. ap a complete complement of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tables are invaluable for commencing the use of writing, as they afford a large surface for numbering and measuring.

Principles of the Capitals. Oval = 70 degrees. 
In writing the Capitals, unmistakable principles should be observed and clear distinctions made, therefore, they are not to be learned without a “Codification of Principles.”

Principles of the Small Letters. 
The Small Letters are composed of an ascending, a descending, a horizontal, a curve, an oblique, and a circle. Now as the Capitals are composed of six parts (the above): so also are the Small Letters, though some of them are comprised of two parts only. In the first lesson, teach the scholars to distinguish the ascending, the descending, the horizontal, the curve, the oblique, and the circle, and when they have a thorough knowledge of these, they are prepared to commence the execution of the Small Letters. 

Principles of the Figures. 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches both the base and head lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the curves, the ovals for the base lines, the ovals, the oval or obliques, at 6 and 7, and the second curves written upwards. 4. The Connecting Lines are the connecting lines. The Forms are usually confined to the space between the base and head lines. 5. The letters that are running or combining, must be formed with one movement.|



PRINCIPLES OF WRITING. 
By M. W. Dorsey. 
The proper foundation for the acquisition of a correct style of Hand-Writing is the thorough understanding and the constant application of the Principles which govern every character. If these principles are not observed, nothing but a clumsy, ill-formed, and fluctuating style can result. To avoid this disastrous consequence, the teacher must, in the commencements, insist on their strict observation, and continue to do so _throughout_ the entire course of instruction. 
The object of this work is to classify and arrange these Principles, in a clear and concise manner, and to present the student of penmanship with a precise and unerring standard of comparison, by which he may judge his own progress, and regulate his efforts. 
First, Position. The position of the body, arms, and hand, contributes greatly to perfect ease, and facility in writing. The best position is when the body is straight, the feet about twelve inches apart, the arms hanging loosely, and the hand resting lightly on the paper. The paper should be inclined in the direction the pupil intends to write. 



The writer should sit at a table the height of the elbow. The left arm rest lightly upon the table, and the left hand holds the paper firmly in its place. The right arm extends freely and lightly over the paper, and the hand is poised above it, ready to move in any direction. The wrist should be flexible, but not stiff; and the hand should be kept as near as possible to the writing. Properly proportioned desks. 
Second, the pen. The pen should be held between the thumb and first finger, allowing the middle finger to guide it. The pen should never be grasped too tightly, or it will be difficult to produce a free and graceful movement. It is useful to have a thick end and a thin end, and adapt the pen to the letter being written. If the pen is too thick, the line will be heavy; if it is too thin, the line will be light. The pen is graduated by penholders, the pen is graduated by steel penholder is fastened to a thick

The mere mechanical copy of characters, without the application of correct Principles, is not writing; it is only imitation. To produce a correct style of Penmanship, the Writer must not only know the rule, but he must also understand the reason of it.
