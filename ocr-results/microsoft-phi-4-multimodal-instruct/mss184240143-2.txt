My Dear My dearest [Name Illegible]

affairs are again awry.  I'm her
aid the party called at S.Comm
must write.  Nice a man as inelined
but "Can't step a Hotel” I am sorry, 
your Theatical Bureau’t represented 
best from success it might have
been with in a different portion. 

You told me you would due so state
upon the occasion of the help of her
you have a “Boy” of some clothing
with your affair. “Presing those Crimson
of Styles.” I can’t & won't dry
before visit.  Manners of those 
seamed to expenses the class of bumpkins 
Best.  That you seemed so sad your rue 
had sloped.  Assume my turning 
me up in a minute but 
more tenderness I won't 
imagine.  Fearful of these not 
plentiful in her station.
