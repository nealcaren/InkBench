unnecessarily relinquish trade to other
cities.  This to made evident by the

General Interest

It now appears that the revised
county road budget is ready for spec-
tacles. The officials responsible for
writing the agreement seem to be
tired and nervous. They are re-
fusing to concede an inch. In view
of the situtation, that the county
officials seem determined to prevail,

the northeast of the city, on the
banks of Snake River, have no idea
of being caught napping.  They ex-
pect a genuine store of trade if such

contrary, afflicted, too bad, poor
boys, who’ve been wrecked one-
hundred per cent by the gambling
spirit, could be overheard ranting
to and fro.  There are many evils to
counter such as this. Today on
main street, in front of the drug-
store, saw a curious parade which
consisted of over fifteen young-
sters of about three years being
carefully shepherded by the
father.



It is well to remember that July
