Dear Journal Friends,

There is to be a suffrage festival here
Nov. 17th and 18th and we are in need of
Journal donations both - Can You send
us any donations and a large Card
for have some “Newbie” Face - and I
have about 50 subscriptions. Frankly-
in news done anything of This sort and
have little idea how to go about it-
But Dr. Minaughton who is putting of the
festivals telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of creating a booth for the
suffrage and so, Mary sends that if by 
the coast is not included in the new Board,
we should start a Journal as an early
afternoon - Hope you can help us.
