Crossing the harbor, the steamer pushed rapidly for Bedloe’s Island, and we were soon ashore for a brief ramble. Col. Chas. S. Merchant, of the regular army, received the ladies, several of whom had resided on the island in the days of hospitals and of battles, being very short, they contented themselves with a hasty party on the sea and land. Contiguous the upper windows of the garrison and Fort Lafayette, the visitors gave three lusty cheers. The donations to the garrison and patients on the island consisted of 400 baskets of strawberries, 2 baskets of cherries, 1 box of watermelons, 2 barrels turnips, 1 barrel beans, 4 quarters, loads, 2 bags peas, 200 head each of cabbage and lettuce, and 50 bunches of radishes and beets. The garrison consisted of the Sixty-second New York regiment, 300 muskets, and the “permanently empty,” and are soon to be pulled down. Everything is in admirable order, and as clean as a pin. Dr. Phillip Adolphus, U. S. A., is in charge.

FORT LAFAYETTE.

Heading down the harbor our little craft was soon fairly on her way toward Fort Lafayette, which forbidding structure was famous during the war as the prison of those who had committed overt acts of treason against the sovereign power of our government. Passing Staten Island, whose beautiful scenery attracted the eye and refreshed the senses, we kept upon the even tenor of our way, enjoying the cool and bracing sea breeze as it came dancing over the waves, from Sandy Hook. Saluting passing steamers with shrill whistles, waving handkerchiefs to a mail steamship just coming from over the Atlantic, the passengers, no doubt, glad to see familiar faces and hands flashing the signals from the lookout. Receiving a last fond invitation to land, the plank was once more run out, or rather up, and the ladies safely entered the perilous ascent by Gaining the interior, we were escorted through the corridor by Lieut. Smith, to the quarters of Colonel Biggs, the Surgeon, and while we, with the permission of the officer, strolled up and down the battery, the director planted the Stars and Stripes.
