SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, APRIL 8, 1865: 4 pgs. in pencil, with cover; C.D.S. at New Orleans, La., stamped 3 (Due) ink docket on cover, "Soldiers' Letter," & signed by Wm. Avery, Lt. Col. 95th Ill. Inf'y." written by Andrew Fern to mother: "We are now seiging this fort which is the main entrance to MOBILE. We first invested the fort the 27th last month, and have been here ever since. We have not lost many men yet, 1 killed and 15 wounded, is all of the regt. There is another fort 6 miles above here called FORT BLAKELY, that is invested by steel, with 15,000 negro troops. The Rebels have a perfect hatred to them, therefore they came out last nite and made three different charges on our negroes. They repulsed them each time. Our regiment is the closest of any regiment on the line. Our rifle pits are within 15 rods of the Rebel works. We are now digging to under mine their works. We are trying to cut off their communication with MOBILE. Much more excellent content, talks about how they are entrenching to avoid the Reb shells, also putting up breastworks, they are planting some big 100 lb. parrot guns; the Rebs have layed torpedoes very thick in the channel which have sunk 2 of their gunboats, the Rebs have also sunk in the ground some torpedoes which have killed quite a number of their men who have walked on them! (the forefather of the land mines!) Written in a very neat bold hand, nice content concerning BLACK TROOPS and the TORPEDO!
