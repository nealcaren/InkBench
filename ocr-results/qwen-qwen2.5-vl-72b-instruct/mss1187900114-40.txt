Life and escape from bondage for me to tell saying, if I told them I should have the volume to keep for my reward. I think I sold ten volumes. They were published by Joseph Barker of Leeds Yorkshire. Kept my book until 1857 and someone stole it and never have I seen one like it since.

The remembrance of all the above notes prompts me to solicit you and your wife to a trial visit. I have been searching for days to find out your abiding home and failed correctly to get it until yesterday. And now a line from you will give me pleasure to say when, where, and at what time you can receive a call from me on yourself and wife whom I have not met. Our homes are not far apart Salem Ohio. Do you remember Benjamin Born Wife old Anti Slavery stalwart. They had an under ground daughter she married John Dennis. My brother's daughter is married to her son at Salem Ohio. The Dennings have an Exhibit in Manufacturers Hall. My husband has been ill and have not yet got to the Fair. Saw you through my glass on Dedication Day in October. Awaiting your early answer with best wishes truly yours. Henrietta Harris Ramoden
