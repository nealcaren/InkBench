To Belfast. Staying however in this City long enough to hold two meetings. I shall not accompany him to Belfast or in any part of Ireland. He will have the field to himself. I could be with them at Cork but it will not be in my power. I am now about to tell you something which will make you think me the most fickle of men. I have decided to stay in this Country six months longer and should not wonder if Mr. Knight should do the same. Though I am sure with far less reason than I have to justify me in staying. I have decided to stay in consequence of the advice both of Mr. Garrison and Mr. Thompson. Both think the present a more favorable opportunity for remodeling the abolition feeling of this Country and bringing it to the aid of the true Anti-slavery Society in America. And each think it would be wrong for me to miss it. I have therefore decided to stay.
