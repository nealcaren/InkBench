Washington D.C.
July 15, 1883.

Dear Grandpa,

We received your affectionate letter on the 12th and we were very glad to hear from you, and know that you are getting along nicely.

Everything is passing along smoothly here, excepting the weather which is at times almost intolerable. It is now about nine o'clock and the thermometer stands about 84½°. Charlie has not left us yet for the Eastern Shore, and I doubt whether he will or not; I think the latter as I don't hear him say anything.
