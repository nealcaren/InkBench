**Gordon Parks**

Born in Fort Scott, Kansas on November 30, 1912, Gordon Roger Alexander Buchanan Parks had to leave home at fifteen, when his mother died. For the next twelve years, he lived mainly in Minneapolis, Minnesota – working as a piano player, bus boy, dining car waiter, Civilian Conservation Corpsman and professional basketball player – before taking up photography in the late 1930’s and moving to Chicago.

In 1942 he was awarded the first Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in photography, and chose to work with Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in Washington, D.C. During World War II, he was an OWI (Office of War Information) correspondent. Later he joined Stryker at Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) as a photographer working out of New York City, and living in White Plains, New York. At that time he wrote his first two books on photography and began doing free-lance fashion photography for Vogue and Glamour magazines.

In 1949, he joined the staff of LIFE magazine and worked there as a photojournalist until 1968, doing over 300 assignments and articles on a wide variety of subjects. In the 1960’s he became famous for his stories on the leaders of the Black Revolution, articles later incorporated into his book, Born Black. Gordon Parks continues to write and photograph for LIFE occasionally, while pursuing his many other projects. He was a founder of Essence magazine, and its editorial director from 1970 to 1973.

His film career began in 1961 when he wrote and directed a documentary, Flavio, the story of a boy from a Brazilian slum, which Parks made famous in LIFE and later in a book. Another famous LIFE story became his second documentary, Diary Of A Harlem Family, 1968, for which he received an EMMY Award. His first Hollywood film was The Learning Tree, which he produced and directed and for which he wrote the screenplay and the musical score.

Mr. Parks then directed the movies, SHAFT, SHAFT'S BIG SCORE (for which he wrote the classic music score), SUPER COPS and Leadbelly.

Gordon Parks’ credits of achievements are enormous: he has written 13 books, produced, written and/or directed 7 motion pictures and 3 documentaries, composed 13 major musical works (classical, blues and popular) and has written articles, poetry and essays and photography for many major publications. He has also been commissioned by major museums for portfolios of photography. His best selling book, “The Learning Tree,” published 25 years ago, is still in print in 9 languages.

Mr. Parks has received many awards for photography, writing, filmmaking and humanitarianism. Among his most valued are the NAACP’s highest award, the Spingarn Medal, and the Governor’s Medal of Merit. He is also the recipient of honorary degrees in literature, fine arts and humane letters from colleges and universities across America.

John F. Kennedy High School in New York, not only named its media center after him, but also gave him an honorary school diploma because he had to leave school just short of graduation during the Depression.

Mr. Parks has three children, three grandchildren and one great grand child.
