Certainly! Here is the complete transcript of the handwritten text:

---

Certainly to be of some  
life to you – you know  
have helped it would make  
me – as it is – I can only  
give you – all the affection  
and sympathy of which my  
heart is capable – I shall  
go to Switzerland – but  
only for a short time –  
I think I shall be there  
about five weeks – I must  
be back in England – on  
the 23rd of August – My  
dear old Father will be  
very glad to see me  
return to home – These people  
for whom I have worked  
very hard during the  
last few months – keep  
to grudge me even these  
few weeks of rest – They  
clear that with me to have  
any relaxation’s life – they would  
not hear – When they mount  
separation from their own children
