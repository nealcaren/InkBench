That all thoughtful people, all lovers of Ohio, of whom I am one, who have the good of the African race at heart—will agree with you in the sound philosophical view you have taken of the subject. Can you address us further in pamphlet form? If so, I shall order some for circulation. This is not a word or thought—in it that I would have changed in any respect. Again I beg to thank you for laying before the American people so valuable and timely an address. I wish you could send a copy to our common friend, Lyons McNeely, Hope Dale, Hamilton Co., Ohio. He is of the old abolition school and please put some mark on or by which he will know from whom he receives it.

Should you come to this city remember you have a Carlo Blucher, which if you follow up, will take you to my house 86 North Prospect St.

Faithfully yours,
Robert H. Douglass
