Dear Mrs. Chapman Catt,

We took in our programme of this year, to read lectures on "Famous Women." Mrs. Reus Ianculescu and I will do it, she in the L.D.J.F. and I in popular evening course. But as there are no complete libraries in Romania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books necessary for preparation. We therefore ask you and the other sections of I.W.S.A. thank you help.

Feeling so much the lips of a few library we will try at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and perhaps then will we be able to assemble around it the women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time. Would you, association be able for the generous act of your help with sisters and to send us one or the old standard work on women movement in your country and specially books where we could find biographies of your famous women?

We would speak in a first series of lectures on political and social prominent women and in a second draw the portraits of some in art and science. But we know so little, it is too sad not now.
