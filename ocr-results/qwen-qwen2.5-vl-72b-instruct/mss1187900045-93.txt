We make some of a scene  
flirtive meeting where  
farewells are now said.  
Remember how much you  
and Frederick dislike farewells  
but - at we say  
happy that I never found  
very dear favor to mean  
by precious as now amidst  
the many trials I heart tend  
ings - disappointments I  
have gone through I can  
realize that "all things"  
must wind up plus  
to this third - When  
we reach your glorious  
city we shall have dear  
Julia be enabled to look  
back on all the way the  
know God has led us to  
humble us - "prove us"  
May our Lord Heavenly Father  
bless you forever, help  
you level faithful and  
affectionate friend
