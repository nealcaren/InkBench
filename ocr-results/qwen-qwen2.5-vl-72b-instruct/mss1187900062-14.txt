If the colored leaders take to denouncing the Supreme Court, they will alienate the sympathies of their best friends in the North. The abolition of slavery is the prohibition of discriminating State laws, the extension of the ballot to the colored man. These are secure. If the colored leaders denounce anybody for not also punishing by law, the unauthorized and absurd exclusion of colored people from particular private property, such as hotels and theaters, it will look rather childish. It will tend to show that the colored people care more for the show than for the substance of citizenship.
