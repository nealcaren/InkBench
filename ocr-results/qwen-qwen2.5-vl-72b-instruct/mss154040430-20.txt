We are urged in this dilemma how we can delight, rule and preserve any feasible way the surpluses from the my own garden at least, during the short season. Those needed here have eaten many dollars worth of clover and other bulbs disappear. At this moment the poor little patches of corn are just beginning to show a clever straight leg the squirrels left out the growing black and eat the dead. Ripe at the end. The birds descend from the skies and eat the robins' branches, the squirrels and the rabbits attend the homesteads. The squirrels like potatoes in the field and later will be with a large number of apples in a tree. The ravens strike.

The sentimentalists New York and including New Rochelle presumably value squirrels and robins as too cute and attractive they ought always relieve among us. Therefore, it is said a law was passed against the preservation thereof. Now both squirrel and rabbit relish chipping from the celery gardens! Squirrels loved on nuts during along cold winter.
