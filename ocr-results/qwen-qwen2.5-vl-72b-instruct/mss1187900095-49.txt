3 pursue, and I trust I shall  
have your approval as well as  
that of Frank Bassett.  

Mr. Blaine has been sick in New  
York for two weeks, and he  
does not seem to get well. There  
is much malice manifested in  
his condition.

I thank you for long and very  
kind letter, and regret that I don't  
feel well enough to pay to you  
now see that I had it in mind  
to pay when I began it. But we  
get worked out even when we are  
very young men ambitious to run  
a long once.

With my kindest regards,  
Yours truly,  
J. M. Hotham
