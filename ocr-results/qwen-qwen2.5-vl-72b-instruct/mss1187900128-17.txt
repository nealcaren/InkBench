I know not where to find justice for them! I appeal to your judgement. I have ever been friendly to the Coloured Race, having lived many years at Cape Haytien in the Island of Hayti, where my husband, under the name of Wilson, Larocque & Co., was well known to the present President of Hayti, as for years he was interested in the purchase of Coffee for the house of Wilson, Larocque & Co. Mr. Wilson was also Consul for the United States, and the recognition of Hayti was effected by him. You will find his record in the State Department. Be so kind as to write for us to influence public opinion in the favor of the Coloured people. Begging you to excuse me for addressing you, I remain Very Respectfully,

Frances L. Wilson
