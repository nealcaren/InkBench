And ten wrecked men with eager hands
Laid graft each golden cord.
And with my heart I saw them on
To see my gracious Lord.

Again I stood beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

F. E. M. Harper.

Growing old:
The prison house in which I live
Is falling to decay;
But God renews my spirit strength
Within these walls of clay.

For me a dimness slowly creeps
Around Earth's fairest lightâ€”
But heaven grows closer to my view
And nearer to my sight.
