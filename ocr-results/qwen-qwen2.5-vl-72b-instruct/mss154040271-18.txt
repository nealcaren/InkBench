**May 24, 1923**

Dear Mary,

Received a book yesterdayâ€”the 27th gift this spring! This book tells how to attain success with a book when the author (would be) has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary to express the idea though she has, it will be most welcome. Until I have read it I shall not know whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or whether to return it or to keep it with thanks either way! I am sending you a tiny box of left over seeds. This is no gift. I just had them left. I haven't the remotest idea what any of them are, but we might find out. If you are nearer I should have given you a garden full of plants from the green house all of which will each bear in my garden or give metered little blossoms. Had you been stalwart wonders in yours. When you come down I shall take you to see a garden that is worth looking at.
