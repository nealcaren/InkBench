Dear Frederick Douglass,

When we first saw your appointment to Hoyti—Cred also has many kind and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you. I began to clip and stick them with the intention of sending them all on to you—I cut “lots” of them—but alas! In the huge piles of Editorial scraps they have all disappeared but these I enclose.

It was pleasant to see the appreciation in which you are held, while you are able to see it. I am not sure that we are glad to have you go. We need you here.
