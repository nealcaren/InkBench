**FELLOWSHIP CHURCH MUSIC**

A National Associate member of Fellowship Church remarked recently that it was worth a trip across the country to join in the hymns of this particular congregation and to hear the singing of the Fellowship Choir. Beginning in the spring of 1946 as a sextet with an occasional soloist, the present choral unit has grown to a choir of thirty voices. Its members form an unusual interracial, intercultural group of serious music students, many of whom are now training for concert careers. The choir is fortunate to be under the leadership of Corrinne Barrow Williams, an outstanding voice teacher of San Francisco. Mrs. Williams chose her pioneering position as builder of one of the most unique choral groups to be found anywhere, in order to demonstrate her belief in the principles to which the Church itself gives testimony.

The Choir has offered five distinctive vesper hours in recent months, continuing the Fellowship Church twilight series based on worship through the arts. They have given hours of poetry and music with Dr. Thurman as reader. Easter Sunday, 1947, they presented the Stabat Mater by Rossini. Recordings were made of this service which are now available to members and friends over the country. May first the Choir secured as accompanist the services of Kay Sadanaga, Nisei concert pianist, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music in New York City.

The Fellowship Quartet, composed of Caucasian, Chinese and Negro representatives, renders a peculiar service. It enriches the musical life of Fellowship Church and contributes to the broad cultural interests of the City of San Francisco. Its personnel, William Von Seiden, Raymond Fong, Joseph Van Pelt and Emory Mellon, have sung at important functions including the annual dinner of the San Francisco Council for Civic Unity, the annual Lutheran Conference banquet, on many occasions for the wounded soldiers at Fort Miley, for the annual breakfast of Past Presidents of the California State Employers Association held at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, and for the Vittoria Colonna, Italian woman's club.

Under the leadership of a special choir committee of the Fellowship Guild, with Katherine Laux as chairman, Jeanette Smoyer, co-chairman, the Choir appears at Temple Emanu-El on May 18 for presentation of the Ingersoll Lecture in beautiful new vestments. Ten of these robes were given by National Associate members especially concerned with Fellowship Church music. The internationally distinguished American baritone, Todd Duncan, contributed the first funds to establish a permanent Fellowship choral unit as a personal expression of his interest and faith in the ideals to which they are giving practical expression.

**Commitment Signers**

Only when several of these parents had expressed their desire for help in meeting the spiritual needs of their children was the first step toward establishment of a Sunday School taken.

On December 13, 1946, four mothers met with Dr. Thurman and Mrs. Bachels, the study group chairman, to determine the general direction in which to go, and the first steps to be taken. All agreed that they wanted their children to have opportunity to discover a sound spiritual basis for everyday living; that whatever they were taught should be so basic that nothing need be unlearned later, but that all would contribute to building dependable foundations for lifelong growth. The few books Dr. Thurman had assembled were distributed to the mothers for study, comment and exchange.

Dr. Fisk suggested Miss Ruth Adamson, a student at San Francisco State College, as a probability for the teacher we needed. Miss Adamson was invited to visit the Church to get the "feel" of the Fellowship Church ideal. After her visit and an interview with Dr. Thurman she met with the mothers to complete preliminary plans.

In the meantime the mothers had inspected the available rooms, and decided that the children should meet in the soundproof radio room at the rear of the downstairs auditorium during the Church hour.

From six children on January 13, the attendance rose to twenty on April 20, 1947. Miss Lillian Raymond, a nursery school teacher, began helping and now the group is divided, with Miss Raymond in charge of the younger children. Kindergarten chairs have been provided through the courtesy of two friends of the Church.

In response to the request of the mothers for guidance in carrying their part of the responsibility the "right person at the right time" has again appeared. Miss Alice Ellis of the Child Guidance Department of the San Francisco Schools asked for information about Fellowship Church just in time to be invited to meet with Miss Adamson and the parents on Monday, May 5.

Since this meeting Miss Ellis has set aside an hour every other week for individual appointments with parents in preparation for the next group discussion. Mothers will keep a record of children's questions apparently stimulated by their Sunday experience, and other questions the parents want help in answering.

The need for music has found a distinctive solution. A zither is used by Sue Thurman, accompanist, to furnish music for the group, and several young members of the Church will be trained by her to carry on this musical program.
