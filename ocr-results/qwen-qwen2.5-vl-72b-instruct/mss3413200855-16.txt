I will give another fifty.

I have a feeling that I did not
send my check to the Cambridge
League for the National League.
I am enclosing a check for $50.00, if
you have already paid will you
destroy this check. My old clock works
fine in Cambridge so I cannot
look it up.

I hope Mass. has been getting
some rain, enough to keep down
the forest fires but not been
deluged as we have been,

It has rained almost incessantly since early May, from
the first to nineteenth of June
we had fifteen days of rain.
Will probably welcome by the
middle of July and will phone
to learn the amount of the
fund.

Very cordially
Zara du Pont
