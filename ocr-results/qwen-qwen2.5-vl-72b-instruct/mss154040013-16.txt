inviting. The gardener brings his flowers and vegetables slung in two large flat baskets; the itinerant barber carries his quaint scarlet stool, brass basin, and shaving implements ready to do any amount of shaving and head scraping and dressing in the open streets. Each of these figures is picturesque in his way. Here and there, among the numerous odd varieties of street stalls, we see a quack doctor, who, seated beneath a widespread umbrella, offers infallible remedies for every “ill that flesh is heir to.” He proves his stores genuine by displaying the skulls, paws, horns, skins, and skeletons of divers animals and reptiles.

Here are scores of banks and shops with barricaded doors showing shroffs busy over baskets of dollars and subsidiary coins, some tying the money up
