After we all went to the village to skate and skater until 'twas eight when I came in and am sitting down to drop a few lines home they all here consider me for not bringing my skates with me and if it is continued I wish that you would have them sent with my other things. I must cut this letter short as it is almost bedtime and we must be up at five o'clock. I should like to hear from home once in a while and you shall hear from me. I know this is not as good writing as you would like but I am in haste to go to bed.

From your affectionate Son Charles R. Douglass
