If you will but keep  
the eye of your own  
Spirit turned within—  
For it is from within  
(not without) that the  
precious jewel of  
truth & light is to  
be sought—as form—  
And darling—Jane  
will find it, & seek  
it, and live it—and  
all men & women will  
call you blessed—  
hastily but oh so dearly  
Susan B. Anthony
