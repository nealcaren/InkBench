anti-slavery people in 1849,
and to whom Garrison and
Phillips sent—on hearing
of his name—by mail a
pamphlet and a letter.
His kindness toward those who
purchased the historic grounds, and
the ships—those negroes—had
made in—continuing—and been
deeply stirred by them. My
wife and mother-in-law—of the
home listened many times
and we all felt—when he
had come. This—had not
conception of the awfulness
of the institution of slavery.
Profound respect for his courage
in its valor and courage &
the man who fought—Harry &
an end
