Washington D.C.
April 13th 1869

Dear Father,

Your reply to my letter was received yesterday.

From what you said in your letter to Lewis I feared that you supposed I was discharged for neglect of duty, or some other such cause, but such was not the case. Genl. Howard did not know at first that I was among the number, and he intimated to me afterwards that had I been a member of the Law Class I would have been retained. The following is the truth:

Mr. Langston has taken charge of the Law Department of the Howard University and has about twenty colored students.
