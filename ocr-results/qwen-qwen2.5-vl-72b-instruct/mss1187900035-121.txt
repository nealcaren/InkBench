I have had a most advantageous situation offered me in Russia - to one of the first families of the land, but - have accepted it. I must have sympathized for the Poles, which work I Mathias retraced that I refused it. Although it was again and again pressed upon me - and that they day received a telegram from Petersburg urging one to accept the invitation. I was glad to be able to write to Countess Bobkoff that I was engaged. If an influence had been aroused, that I should have been dead to Frida. [?]
