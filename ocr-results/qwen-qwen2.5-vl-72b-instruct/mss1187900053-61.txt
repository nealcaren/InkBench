Dear Mr. Douglas,  

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and I write now in hopes of producing a reply. We really are very much in the dark about you & do not even know whether you still hold office under the Government, as we have not heard the contrary. I conclude that you do – therefore that you have not been lecturing & holding meetings over the country this last winter as of old. I hope that your health is good – & that you can report well of yourself & of your family.
