**My dear Mr. Day & Son:**

Some few East Co. [East Coast] friends of mine & how I have put off so
long my calling on you & Mrs. Douglas that
I shall have much reason to make my
excuses to your firm wife for me.  I remember
her with so much pleasure in Paris.  I hope 
on turn to Chicago later in the summer
Then I will not fail to see you both. 

The meanwhile I have my,

*Vary best regards,*
