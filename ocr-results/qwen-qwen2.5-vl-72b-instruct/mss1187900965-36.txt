3 sentimentalisms? On what
could the Kenneth Rayners, &
the members of the Mess expect
their eloquence?

If we knew Mrs Miller & her
steamboat, Mr Douglas & his wife
into the camps of a Polygamy,
prove logically that "United
States citizens" have a right
to choose their own modes of
employment. Half the writing &
speaking in this country
as to class privileges
might be ended. Until
the day when in the discussion
of human rights, exact equal
justice will be demanded for all
without distinction of race or sex,
With my kind regards to your
wife, & my best wishes for you
truly yours
Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
