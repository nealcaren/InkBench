Dear Journal Friends,

There is to be a Suffrage Festival here Nov. 14 and 15 and we are to have a Woman's Journal booth. Can you send us any decorations and a large card? We have some "Newsie" flags and I have about 50 subscription blanks. I've never done anything of this sort and have little idea how to go about it. But Dr. MacNaughton who is getting up the festival telephoned this morning that Alice Paul had sent her word she would not pay the cost of erecting a booth for the Suffragist and if she did not pay the costs of erecting the booth she would let it be used for the Journal the paper she preferred to help. I promised to see to it.

Order given to S. Gregory  
Nov 12 1913  
Send 200 Nov. 15 cards  
200 cards and blanks  
2 W.D. Porters  
2 Wards Sun Prints
