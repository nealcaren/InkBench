I know a poet weeps when
he hears it!!! I want to take
his Junior when I'm absent,
surely I prefer mine when I
have the same chance to judge
as he—

I don't know whether you
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter from my western
friend but I enclose a
copy—

Goodbye
again
with heartiest
wishes for your health
especially if you think of
facing the rigor of a
New England summer next
July—
