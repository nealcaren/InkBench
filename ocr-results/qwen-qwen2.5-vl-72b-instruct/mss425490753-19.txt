**Building the Builders of Chicago**

J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year), Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), rally to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked beans go big with Cornelius—Barbara says the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy goes hard for the soup and a big cut of that spicy mince pie.

You are building a better Chicago—we are building better Chicagoans.

**RUTH McCORMICK, DENEEN SOUND CAMPAIGN CRIES**

Senator Attacks County Administration.

BY PARKE BROWN

Both United States Senator Deneen and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, who has announced her candidacy against him, manifested yesterday what was construed as a desire to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked beans go big with Cornelius—Barbara says the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy goes hard for the soup and a big cut of that spicy mince pie.

Senator Deneen addressed more than 100 of his followers—Chicago ward committeemen, county town precinct committeemen, and officeholders—at a luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It was a closed meeting, but later the senator made a public part of his speech in which he criticized the condition existing in the local governments.

She's in Senate Race.

"I want to say emphatically now that I am in the race for the Republican nomination for United States senator and that I shall be in the race every minute up to the closing of the polls on April 10, 1930."

"I traveled 34,000 miles in the state of Illinois in 1927 and 1928 in my campaign for Congress and visited every county in the state. I am going to make an even more vigorous campaign for the senate. I have established state headquarters on the seventh floor of the London Guaranty and Accident building, 360 North Michigan avenue."

"I am returning to Washington today to attend the sessions of the annual river and harbor congress in order to continue my regular duties in the house of representatives. I plan to start my speaking campaign immediately after Christmas and continue it until Jan. 6; and my time thereafter will be so divided that my work in Illinois will require a minimum of interruption of my duties in congress. I not only propose to press my campaign vigorously but I expect to be nominated on April 10."

Announces O. P. Meeting.

B. W. Snow, vice campaign manager of the Republican county central committee, announced that the committee will be called into session next Friday afternoon to tackle the task of reorganization made possible by the withdrawals of former Chairman Homer K. Galpin and Robert E. Crowe, former secretary. The meeting probably will be held in the Hotel La Salle at 3 o'clock.

**WIFE DIVORCES MORSE IN RENO; HE LOSES PLEA**

Reno, Nev., Dec. 9.—(Special)—Jared Kirtland Morse of the chemistry department, University of Chicago, and formerly of New York, today lost a divorce action he instituted a week ago when his wife, Eleanor Chapin Morse, was awarded the decree.

The decree was allowed Mrs. Morse on her deposition that he had deserted her during an illness. Mr. Morse was awarded $1,500 a year alimony for herself and an adopted child, 17 years of age, now in her custody. They were married at Rochester, N. Y., in July, 1910.

In his complaint Morse alleged his wife had been a hindrance to his ambitions, bodily scientific researches, and that when he left the faculty of the University of Chicago, she came to live with him, but constantly nagged him. Mrs. Morse denied his allegations.

**Senator Condemns Prejudice**

"In this great campaign let us emphasize that those who appeal to the prejudices of our citizens for votes and those citizens who permit their prejudices to determine their votes are equally unworthy and merit public condemnation."

Senator Deneen also told his followers that his group has made no deal on a county ticket with any other faction or any Republican leader outside its own fold.

Mrs. McCormick's Statement

The statement of Mrs. McCormick read as follows:

"I Reports recently circulated in Illinois by political opponents are intended to confuse the public as to the senatorial situation."
