Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 25, 1883.

Honorable
Fred Douglas,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglas:

I read your speech delivered on the occasion commemorative of Emancipation in the District of Columbia and I was particularly edified and pleased by your utterances, and surprised at the vigor and brilliancy of your powers after an almost constant reference of them for nearly a half century in the cause of oppressed people.
