My dear Mr. Dickens,

Thank you for your last letter. I have been lately in conversation with Brown who has been close to Chase and knows exactly yet can I not admit that the responsibility there lies next to all on him. His position in the place to succession to the presidential chair is at least known as that of almost every other person in the city, and I cannot but regard it as having been affected decidedly in his favor since he has shown himself larger disposed in every instance to maintain a lecture that strict drift which was to be in direct opposition to any over partisan views.

In the very brief conversation which succeeded our departure from the theatre, Mr. Lincoln knew him keenly and a character. He has delivered at Cooper Institute the day before and which I had heard described. The fact, then, that he, who I heard there, acts here now, does not lead me to believe that he has been heard to deliver a lecture on all resembling his lines of any lecture which he has delivered here. And as much as delivering lectures presented to the public. I have seen them.
