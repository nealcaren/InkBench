**THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.**  
Some Iowa newspapers carry the erroneous impression that the special law enforcement agents are appointed by the attorney general. These special officers are named by the governor. If Iowa should elect a “liberal” governor he probably would have “liberal” special agents.—Sloux City Tribune.  

**MR. IRISH GROWING OLD.**  
Nothing is sadder in this world than the change that comes over so many men as they shift from the buoyant enthusiasms of youth to the view-with-alarm despondency of age. We do not know of an illustration more to the point than the speeches John P. Irish is now making in Iowa against woman suffrage when contrasted with the speeches he made in the Iowa legislature for woman suffrage.  
John P. Irish was a forward looking man in the old days when with spontaneous eloquence he pleaded for equal rights. Now he is as solemnly alarmed as any other pessimist. It is really too bad that so many estimable people begin to see everything in the time.  

**A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.**  
The Register recently asked of the Chicago Tribune “why did not Washington and Madison and Jefferson and Hamilton and the constitution makers meet the situation and give this country an army and a navy at the start?”  
The Tribune comes back with the claim that these men would have done so if congress would listen to them. The Tribune quotes a number of familiar passages from Washington, and then jumps to the conclusion that our school histories ought to be rewritten to show the military purposes of the fathers.  
It is not worth while to quibble with the Tribune, but it is worth while to get at the real point of view of the men who started this nation out, in a military way, without a military fitting, in the belief that a great, peaceable, industrial democracy could be built in this new land free from the follies and blunders that had wrecked every earlier attempt at human organization.  
The Register will not go to the school histories, but will go to Alexander Hamilton, because of all the men who signed the Declaration of Independence, he alone had the military experience that fitted him to speak with authority on the subject.  
Hamilton wrote in his famous “Federalist Papers,” “The militia of the several states compose the reserve military force of the United States.” He further said, “The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were realizable. No theoretical system can be devised which will not leave room for specious objections and plausible arguments against the plan of the convention.”  
Hamilton believed in a well-regulated militia, but he did not believe in a standing army. He said, “A standing army is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.” He further said, “The idea of restraining the legislative authority in the case of money is an absurdity. The government ought to possess absolute discretion with respect to the appropriation of its revenues.”  
The Register believes that the founders of our government were wise in their day and generation, and that we should follow their example in our day and generation.  

**When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage**  
In the legislative session of 1870 an amendment proposing woman suffrage was passed by both houses of the Iowa legislature, and passed the house in the session of 1872 and the senate in the session of 1872 and the amendment was not submitted to popular vote. John P. Irish engineered the amendment through the house both in 1870 and 1872. John P. Irish was member from Polk and he voted for the amendment at both sessions.  
This amendment was far-reaching and read as follows:  
Laws of Iowa 1870: 232. Joint Resolution No. 14. Joint resolution proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa so as to provide for its submission and publication.  
Be it resolved by the general assembly of the state of Iowa, That the following amendments to the constitution of the state of Iowa, be and are hereby proposed:  
Strike from section 1 of article II of said constitution, the word “male.”  
Strike from section 4 of article III of said constitution, the word “male.”  
Resolved further, That these resolutions proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa be chosen to be submitted to the legislature to be chosen at the next general election, and that the secretary of state shall cause the same to be published for three months previous to the time of the next general election of members of the legislature in one newspaper in each congressional district.  
Approved April 4, 1870.  

**WHAT MR. IRISH SAID.**  
Legislative supplement, session of 1870, March 29, 1870: Mr. Irish—it is to be expected that I, as the member who introduced this resolution, out of deference to the joint resolutions, should say something on the question before the house. Let us view it, if you choose, in the light of an experiment at whose inception we stand today. Let us learn from the poetry of the proposition of the question, for the poetry of the proposition has been given in its most eloquent manner by the gentleman from Scott, Mr. Greene. Let us view it in its prosiest shape and see if there is any actual strength in the proposition.  
There is an objection to the passage of this joint resolution can not object thereto because it has never been demanded by the class proposed to be affected by it. The best and most talented women of the land—those who during the late war showed their love of country by works which were not less laborious than those performed by the soldier in the field. Now they have opened the doors of universities, schools and professional institutions to women; after you have acquired knowledge that will enable them to enable a profession does it not seem hard that your system of law should become so that, if they acquire property by the practice of that profession, they are liable to taxation in the manner of taxation? Is not this hard? Your women go to normal schools and other institutions of learning for the purpose of teaching a profession. She goes into the world as a teacher and stands side by side with a man that has not half her culture or ability; and yet while she brings forth a child, keeps house, attends to the business, while her labors are crowned with greater success. She goes her side of the house and heart? I grant all that, in many cases; but remember, gentlemen, that while women are the idols of homes and the queens of our hearts and households, there are thousands of that class who are the idols of no homes and the queens of no hearts. Remember there are those who are compelled from their earliest youth to fall back on their own weak resources for all they shall want in this life; and for whom society permits no experiment to be tried. The country has reached this position of affairs that we must either progress or retrograde. Time was when women demanded the privilege of speaking in public, and it might have been proper that Paul should exhort them to keep silence in churches. He said nothing of the American women, that they should keep silence at the polls or legislature. Paul claimed inspiration, but it is singular that nowhere in the writings of his divine master do you find sentiments expressed. Jesus, in the most sublime of all his sayings, in his sermon on the mount, excited men and women to deeds of charity, to be merciful and humble that they may one day walk with their God. This book teaches that men and women should alike be judged by the judgments of the law, should alike die and arise at the resurrection. As they are to travel side by side spiritually, does it seem wise that we should place them in a temporary position of disadvantage, where their ambition is to be unsatisfied, where their aspirations are never to be realized? And morally should we not do it? In doing that we are obeying the spirit of the scripture. I care not what might have been said by Paul or any other apostle, who was so unfortunate as to live and die a bachelor. It is better to refer to the teachings of one who was a little bit heavenly and pedantic in his views and manner of expression. The gentleman from Dubuque (Mr. O'Donnell) has ably spoken on the subject of obtaining education, or you must take a step forward. You must proceed to the logical result that must follow the opening of the universities which have given birth in our midst to those applications which education ever brings to those who possess it. We are at the inception of the question. How can this experiment be demonstrated a success? How can the family around which we should throw every safeguard, suffer by the prosecution of this experiment? For who has a higher interest in the maintenance of the family, in all its purity and goodness, than woman has? When woman is concerned that the family, its organization, must surely be by this experiment, will you tell me that she will not be the first to recede from this position? I am willing to leave the question in the hands of the family—is to suffer or be degraded, I know she will abandon the prosecution of a dangerous experiment.  

**IN A SECOND SPEECH.**  
Mr. Irish—I am requested by the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Ball) to read certain parts of the holy scripture. They are the Corinthians, fourth chapter, fourteenth and thirty-fifth verses; Epistle of Paul to Timothy, eleventh and twelfth verses.  
If I were competent, I would say, in explanation, that Paul was then speaking to the Corinthian women—I do not know whether they may have been utterly unqualified to speak in public, and it might have been proper that Paul should exhort them to keep silence in churches. He said nothing of the American women, that they should keep silence at the polls or legislature. Paul claimed inspiration, but it is singular that nowhere in the writings of his divine master do you find sentiments expressed. Jesus, in the most sublime of all his sayings, in his sermon on the mount, excited men and women to deeds of charity, to be merciful and humble that they may one day walk with their God. This book teaches that men and women should alike be judged by the judgments of the law, should alike die and arise at the resurrection. As they are to travel side by side spiritually, does it seem wise that we should place them in a temporary position of disadvantage, where their ambition is to be unsatisfied, where their aspirations are never to be realized? And morally should we not do it? In doing that we are obeying the spirit of the scripture. I care not what might have been said by Paul or any other apostle, who was so unfortunate as to live and die a bachelor. It is better to refer to the teachings of one who was a little bit heavenly and pedantic in his views and manner of expression. The gentleman from Dubuque (Mr. O'Donnell) has ably spoken on the subject of obtaining education, or you must take a step forward.
