all this to acquire necessary experience to be
received by those I would help, that I fully know
their trouble & could not but make common cause
with them - If so it is but a blessing in disguise!
And now let me add that on Easter eve I
was sought by the Director of Howe Institute
mentioned in annexed paper - to tell me he had
heard that "Philanthropic money" as he called it would
be found in the North (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for such rich work as I had hinted
to which he added the suggestion mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 4 Page 1 of the
Chicago
Daily Inter Ocean of 25 March giving an account
of a successful colored colonization at Tuskegee
Alabama - to which I refer you as most interesting
It is a number of 64 pages printed at
an immense # of copies as its 81 anniversary which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair. When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion & counsel how best to proceed
I feel sure of your sympathy for the cause - perhaps "for auld lang syne" to remain, hopefully
with very best wishes of the season for your
continued prosperity, dear Sir
most truly yours
