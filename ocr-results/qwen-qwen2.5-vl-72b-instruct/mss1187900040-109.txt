But it really seems that
I am never—never to have
what I wish for.
Every thing seems against
me—I wonder if some
of us are really destined
to suffer—Perhaps it is
the only means of
softening the heart—and
of teaching us true
sympathy—Oh do let
it be better to be afflicted
for it is terrible to be
indifferent to the sorrow
of our fellow creatures!
To know by sad experience
what it is—to be misunderstood
by those—whom we have
fastened over smiles—
Brave hard hearted they
are—their coldness is worse
to bear than the sorrow—what
breaks the heart—
