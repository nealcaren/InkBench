London Sunday May 6, '94

Dear Mr. Douglass:

Your letter directed Manchester has followed me all around till it reached me here. I am indeed glad to get it. When I wrote to you I had not seen your letter. Mr. Aked, since seeing it, I know from what he and others said, that while they did not expect "quah" (may they pay you the same compliment I do, in knowing you incapable of such a thing) still they would have been better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. Mr. Welch thought that since the Society had failed so miserably and I was thus left to vouch for myself, you would not hesitate to vouch for me. We cannot go thru the country telling people about this personal quarrel and why I am unaccompanied by the persons who brought me over. At the least known member of the race, a positive little or vouch.
