Bill-of-Sale for Frederick Douglass

Know all men by these Presents, That I, Thomas Auld, of Talbot county, and State of Maryland, for and in consideration of the sum of one hundred dollars current money to me in hand paid by Hugh Auld, of the city of Baltimore ... do grant, bargain, and sell unto the said Hugh Auld, his executors, administrators, and assigns, one negro man, by the name of Frederick Baily, or Douglass, as he calls himself, — he is now about 28 years of age, — to have and to hold said negro man for life.... In witness whereof, I set my hand and seal, this thirteenth day of November, eighteen hundred and forty-six.

(Signed) THOMAS AULD

This 1859 sculpture by John Rogers of an auction scene showing slaves sold as farm animals had a telling effect when reproduced in The Abolitionist. A professional engineer handicapped by failing eyesight, Rogers began modeling in clay as a pastime. An early effort, his "Slave Auction" was followed by scores of other Rogers miniatures that accurately depicted army and domestic life during Civil War times. Plaster copies were manufactured and sold by the thousands. Photograph by courtesy of The New-York Historical Society, New York City, which possesses one of largest Rogers collections extant.
