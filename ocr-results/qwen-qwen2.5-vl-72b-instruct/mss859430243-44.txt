NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner  
Cobo Hall  
Detroit, Michigan  

Greetings:

It is my pleasure and a privilege to extend congratulations and best wishes to you tonight as you gather for the 29th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner. This dinner, which brings together a great ethnic, social and economic mix of people united in the struggle against bigotry and discrimination, is vital to the work of the NAACP.

The 75th anniversary of the founding of the NAACP is truly cause for celebration. Over the years, few organizations have had as great -- or as beneficial -- an influence on our society as has the NAACP. As the foremost civil rights organization in the United States, the NAACP and its victories in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Congress and state legislatures have brought about a more equal society and improved the lives of millions of Americans.

Yesterday's victories were not achieved without a struggle -- nor will tomorrow's. I join with you in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the NAACP and in dedicating ourselves to building a society based on tolerance, equality and opportunity for all.

Sincerely,

James J. Blanchard  
JAMES J. BLANCHARD  
Governor
