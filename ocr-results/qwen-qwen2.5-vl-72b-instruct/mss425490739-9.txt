**IN THE LAND O'COTTON**

President Warmly Received in Georgia Today.

VISITED MOTHER'S HOME

ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROSWELL AND ATLANTA.

Many Tender Recollections of His Early Childhood Awakened by Visit to the Old Homestead.

ROSWELL, Ga., October 20.—President Roosevelt today carried out his long-cherished plan of visiting the home of his mother—Roswell, Ga. One of his reasons for coming south was that he might see the old homestead where his mother spent her girlhood and which she left a happy bride. That the visit was fraught with many tender recollections was evident, and as his carriage drove away from the old Bulloch mansion, where his mother lived and married, the President murmured to Mrs. Roosevelt: "I can hardly bear to leave here."

The President reached Roswell at 7:30 o'clock this morning, and was joined here by Senator and Mrs. Clay, who were his guests at breakfast. He then entered a carriage and was driven to the mansion. This fine old homestead is now the property of J. D. Wing, a lumber merchant of this section, who lives in it with his sister, Mrs. Wood, the postmaster of Roswell.

Here he was greeted by two old servants who lived in the house during his mother's young womanhood. One of these is "Aunt Grace," who acted as maid to Miss Martha Bulloch, who afterward became Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, and the other is William Jackson, who decorated the mansion on the occasion of the marriage of its young mistress.

The President was deeply touched as he shook the hands of these old servants. In company with Mrs. Roosevelt he went through the spacious house, calling to the attention of the company many incidents connected with his mother's childhood. Before leaving the mansion he posed with Mrs. Roosevelt for a picture which included "Aunt Grace" and "Daddy William."

On the way to the train the President stopped for a moment at the home of Dr. Baker, where he met the pastor's wife, who was one of his mother's bridesmaids.

In the escort which conducted the President from his train to the different points he visited was Warren E. Crockett, who was a member of Col. Roosevelt's regiment during the Spanish war.

The reception of the President at the old home of his mother was a cordial one. Many people greeted him both as President and as the son of an old friend. Many were the kind references to his mother from those who knew her, and many were the expressions of good will toward her distinguished son. The President's train left for Atlanta shortly before 10 o'clock.

Reception at Atlanta.
ATLANTA, Ga., October 20.—The day broke clear, but soon after sunrise heavy clouds overcast the sky, presaging rain and causing much anxiety that the program arranged for President Roosevelt's visit might be spoiled by rain. The thousands of residents of Atlanta were multiplied by throngs of sightseers from the surrounding country and neighboring states, who arrived early.

Everywhere along the line of the parade from the terminal station to Piedmont Park, where the Georgia State Fair Association is holding its annual exhibition, decorations were profuse. The national colors floated from every building along the way from business houses to the homes of Atlanta's citizens lining Peachtree street. Pictures of the President were seen on every side, many bearing mottoes of praise and commendation to the city's distinguished guest.

The route of the parade was about three miles long. The presidential train rolled into the terminal station exactly on time, and as it was sighted coming through the yards every steam whistle in the city blew a noisy welcome. Waiting on the station platform were the reception committee headed by Governor Terrell, Senator S. A. Clay, Congressman Livingston, Mayor Woodward and Bishop C. K. Nelson. To greet Mrs. Roosevelt was a small committee of ladies led by Mrs. Terrell, wife of the governor, and Mrs. Mary Howell, Governor Heyward of South Carolina, a guest of Governor Terrell, was made an honorary member of the committee on reception.

As the train came to a stop Gov. Terrell, Senator Clay, accompanied by Mrs. Terrell and Mrs. Howell, entered the President's car to welcome the distinguished guests. A moment later the party emerged and introductions followed. The original plan to have the President pass the waiting room of the station had been vetoed by the secret service, and the party was taken to the street level by a baggage elevator and entered carriages back of the station.

Mrs. Roosevelt and her escort departed almost simultaneously for the governor's mansion on Peachtree street, where they were greeted by a reception committee of about 100 society ladies and witnessed the parade from that point of vantage.

The line of march was quickly formed and the President and his escort started for Piedmont Park. The marching order was as follows:

The Line of March.
Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th United States Infantry, acting as marshal of the day; platoon of mounted police; troop of the 12th Cavalry from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., commanded by Maj. H. G. Sickel; President's carriage, containing, beside himself, Secretary Loeb, Gov. Joseph M. Terrell and Maj. James G. Woodward; carriage containing members of the President's party; troop of the 12th Cavalry; carriages of reception committee, city council and delegation from the different counties of the state; Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th Infantry, U. S. A., Fort McPherson, Ga., and staff.

Seventeenth Infantry Band, 5th Regiment Georgia state militia and band, Firemen's Drum and Bugle Corps of Atlanta, provisional regiment composed of cadets from the Georgia Military Academy, Gordon Institute and Marist College, Governor's Horse Guards and other military organizations.

The route of the parade was Mitchell street to Whitehall street, to Peachtree, to 14th, to Piedmont Park.

At the Fair Grounds.
The President arrived at Piedmont Park at 11:10 o'clock. The steam whistles of the state fair blew an enthusiastic welcome and the thousands assembled shouted themselves hoarse as the President entered the grounds. A review of the military escort was held, headed by the 17th Infantry, which returned a few weeks ago from the Philippines.

From a stand erected facing the grand stand of the race course the President delivered his address. Dudley Hughes, introduced the President, who was present, introduced Gov. Terrell, who in turn presented Mayor Woodward to welcome the President and he was followed by Senator Clay, who introduced the President. Gov. Terrell's allusions to the President's efforts for international peace were received with rousing cheers. Mayor Woodward presented the President with a block of Georgia marble, a memento from Georgia's organized labor, prepared by union labor.

As the President arose to speak he was greeted by the immense throng rising and cheering.
