My Dear Mrs. Catt:

I am in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, at the present with a fractured leg. I have been here 8 weeks today. Hope soon to be released from this terrible home of torture, a cast, so that I can return to my little apartment at 609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena Calif. Many friends are wonderful to me in all ways. Address my close friend Mrs. Lois Gentile, 1918 Oak St., So. Pasadena - who has all of me in charge.

Cordially  
Henrietta G. Moore
