Departmental but have not received an answer yet. I expect one tonight. It has been beautiful weather ever since you left and I do not think we will have much snow but it will be keen and sharp. Elizabeth is making preparations to read her lecture next Monday night and leave us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. She has not made any other appointments yet but I think today and tomorrow Levi will attend to it. Judge writing in a great deal of noise and confusion best brought three dinners are as full of sleep as possible. I hope you will have a comfortable time as possible and that you will not return home sick. Old Brown will have to keep out of sight for a little while the Governor of Missouri has a reward of $3,000 offered for his capture and Daniel has given himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love and enclosed you will find a note from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie will send a few lines.

Your affec. Daughter
