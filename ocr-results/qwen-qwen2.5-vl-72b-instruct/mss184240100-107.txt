My Dear Miss Dickinson,  
Your favor of the 19<sup>th</sup> containing a Check for Five Hundred Dollars came safely to hand and I should have acknowledged its receipt at once; much as we found both Leonice and myself to will we had it ever do little: we are now better and hope to continue so-- We all ever thankful for all events we thank you.  
  

With many thanks, for your favors and Gentleman serves much love to you & your Mother Eunia
