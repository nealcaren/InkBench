Dear Friend,

I expect the rest. I look for no other weapon. Death, Labor, Care, Griefs have been my lot since I can remember. The clouds which have overshadowed her life seem to become more threatening as travel on. But I do not dread them as formerly. I have fought the storms of life as a man can nobly. The thought that very life has lost its relish with years, belov'd friend, makes me wish to tread the same path you are treading. I would that I have a resting place where that voice have been.
