Grandpa was never called "Hosea."
He was first Frederick Bailey. The slave
changed to Johnson when he ran
away and because the mariner
whose home he lived in New Bedford
Mass. was named Johnson. This man
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglas," asked
Grandpa to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, instead
would like to call himself
Douglass instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another and hence-
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass.
These are facts—not hearsay.

Later—Just read letter from Fred—he
leaves on his "debating tour" today—
and really debates at Harvard. He
will stop with Oral. I've already written
Joe's wife & Marie and sent Oral word.
