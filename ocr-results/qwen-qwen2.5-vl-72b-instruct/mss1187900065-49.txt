jump with which I now enclose, and
seem its payment by a mortgage on farm
stock, implements & household furniture.
The stock consists of four fine horses, two
fine Alderny milk cows, a fine Alderny
bull, 3 jacks, family carriage, farm
wagons etc. The furniture fully paid
for. Conditions: Farming implements
are required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at private sale for
$8000 and no full price nice to sold
now after spring opens, as it is worth
considerably more money.
They would not allow one task this
farm again but for the absolute certainty
of the security they offer. No word
I do doubt, and for the emergency
of their situation. Should the place
be offered at a moderate sale, it would
ruin the sale privately, as you will
see at a glance.
Can you help them, in this how of their


great need? If you can twice so
inform me, I will have the necessary
papers executed. Take them & join
any day you may name.
I feel, Mr. Douglas, that
while our claims upon you is nothing
beyond your regard for their worth,
pleading is unnecessary. If you
can do it, we will be deeply grateful
from what you decide in relieving them.
Please write me as early as fourth
in enclosed envelope.


Yours truly
John Sears
