My Dear daughter, I hope you are still getting along alright. we are well, Dorise is still on the job. and keeping the house to summer time heat, despite the nice bright weather we are having. Brother and part of the family was here last night. They brought Mrs Cotton over to church and waited here while she was in service.
Daisy was not feeling well. she had been to the Doctor earlyin during the day. He gave her Va shot. and she says it left her feelingdizzy and sleepy. she did not look well at all. so I called to-day. said she was feel- ing better.
I am sending a letter that came to-day from High- lander. and one that came last week. so from to-day on I will forward Them direct. write when you Can.
much love from us. to you. from mother
