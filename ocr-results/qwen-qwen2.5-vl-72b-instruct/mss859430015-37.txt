My dear daughter,- Miss Mack came yesterday and brought the box and visited with me awhile. She said she had a nice trip up and working at home and clearing away weeds in the back and the like.

We were very glad to talk with you Sunday night. It helps Parkes, feel well at present. Brother and family are doing very well. He doesn't come so often now, is still working - they are getting welfare help. I hope you are well and won't overwork before you come home.

Now that school is out I suppose some of the children will be over to stay. Much love from mother.
