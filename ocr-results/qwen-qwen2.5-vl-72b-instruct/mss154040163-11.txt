My dear Steady: I have to thank you for his letters and the notes and clippings concerning Mrs. Blinn. I thank you especially for the clippings for, as you suspect, I am interested in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the National Convention, I think Mrs. Sewell brought a letter she had received from Effie Vance, and she had described very vividly how Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her suffering thro' Christian Science. Sewell's tears flowed as she read it, and she was no great admirer of Mrs. B. I believe she told me that E. Vance was also getting interested in Ch. Sci. Mrs. B. was one of the most generous and forgiving natures ever met, and although she also had her weaknesses of character, as we do the rest of us, she was a woman to be admired for very many estimable qualities.
