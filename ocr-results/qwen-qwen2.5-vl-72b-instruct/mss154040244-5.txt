You will tell her about the League's crowd face. We are meeting tomorrow to come to definite conclusions about the design, inscription, etc., for the Memorial tablet in Washington on which the National Honor Roll names are to be placed. The unveiling is to take place at the time of our Council Meeting in Washington in April. With gratitude - very cordially yours always affectionately, Katharine Ludington
