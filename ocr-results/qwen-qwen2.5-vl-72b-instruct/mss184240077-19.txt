Dear Prion quite a "little lion," over here.

Caro says "Oh!" I hope so too, & give thee my dear love - & my love to Uncle Luxie.

I won't write today if I live up till wife receives thee a line in a telegram tomorrow.

My love to thee, & a dear duckie & very deep whole heart to my Mammae from Anna

The fine weather ought to do thee good.
Kisses.
