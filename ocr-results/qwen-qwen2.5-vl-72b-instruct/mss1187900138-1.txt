Hon Fred Douglass  
Dear Sir  

Francis M. Adlington of Weymouth Mass. 86 Years of age sends the following offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration  

"Father Abraham Monument"  
This Monument would seem to say That Lincoln's dead, but 'tis not so.  
In vain the assassin's aim to slay In vain his blood was made to flow.  
In vain the vile attempt to kill In all our hearts he's living still.  
And while a drop of patriot's blood Shall flow in any human frame  
Will thrill at memory of the good The great and noble Lincoln name.  
This Monument we raise to thee Great Chief Whose Mandate Made us free Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend For thee our true and constant friend.  

Also the following  
"An Ode to America Personified"  
The World is gazing on thee.  
Dispose Thy robes with Care And with thy precious jewels Adorn thy Golden hair.  

"Over"
