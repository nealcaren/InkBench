THE CAREER  
OF THE  
GOD-IDEA IN HISTORY.  

BY HUDSON TUTTLE,  
AUTHOR OF "ARCANA OF NATURE," "ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY  
OF MAN," ETC.  

Dwelling in the light that no man can approach unto.... Canst thou  
by searching find out God?... Touching the Almighty, we cannot find  
him out.â€”BIBLE.  

Nothing of him that doth fade,  
But doth suffer a sea-change  
Into something rich and strange.  
SHAKESPEARE.
