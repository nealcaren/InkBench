Dear Miss Blackwell,

I am blessed with a propensity to be always at something. You are something; still you will not draw an illogical conclusion, as three successive spiteless might tempt a less reasonable creature to do.

The truck is, its hot; hot beyond creed, to say nothing of dead. What recourse else was left but you. The other evening so & so was spoken of to me as having done this and that as nurse in the war, I was called on its admire her. I had to say yes, I admire what she did. But must she not be a noble woman to do so much. Then I said its very well for we you and she & me, to some good. No - the only recommendation we can have our dead nor deed to recommend him. seeing whom one thinks not how much he has done or can do, but how much he is.

I fancied I was talking Greek,
without much luck, but you who understand Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
