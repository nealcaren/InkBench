**Left Side:**

My tour was up the structure of the
Masonic, glass and steel - modern architecture - we are just installing
the new automatic
no service whatever. A letter from the Port
Authority received yesterday informs us we
are to accept more than our fair share of the work - its policy
being to accept more contracts than it can fulfill
and to shut down on any least excuse. The time lost
to the firm in the last two weeks, estimated at
more than $1000.00. I wonder if you can imagine what this means and
its effect on the morale of the men. It is a disgrace.


**Right Side:**

You may have already seen - if so, just
destroy them - This one-
pasted below struck me
as particularly lovely.
I wonder if
you knew
Dr. Lewi...?

Here I stop
You that since
May 1st we
have had
Elevator service
only sharsely, and that from
Monday next to the end
of the process


**Memorial Set Up to Dr. Emily Lewi**

Friends of the late Dr. Emily Lewi presented a check for $14,000 yesterday to the trustees of the New York Infirmary to start an endowment fund in her memory. Income will be used for the care of ailing women physicians connected with the infirmary and their children.

The check was presented to Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the board of trustees, by Dr. Marion Manter, medical director of the infirmary, at the end of a meeting of the trustees in the Fuller Building, 597 Madison Avenue.

Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Lewi: "She was one of the older doctors who had the courage of their convictions and the consecration to uphold the infirmary as a center of training and service by women doctors. Without her work and that of her associates the infirmary would long since have closed its doors."

Dr. Lewi, who died two years ago, was a pediatrician who practiced more than fifty years and served as director of pediatrics at the infirmary from 1930 to 1938. She was known as an outstanding teacher and diagnostician and was one of the pioneers in endocrinology.

One room in the projected new infirmary building will be known as the Emily Lewi Memorial Room, the trustees said, and the endowment will support it.
