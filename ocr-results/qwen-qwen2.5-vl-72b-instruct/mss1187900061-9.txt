Instead of making Murilla and Biskets I would try send you a line. I hope you will excuse Bad writing and Spelling as you will find. I have seen Miss Kriger twice since you left. Every thing is going on just the same so I have No news to tell you all are well at home hoping that you are. Rosa is well and sends love to you:

Truly your friend
