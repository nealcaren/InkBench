Woman's Column,
Boston, Mass.

Please send the Woman's Column to the three names inclosed for one year. Find 75¢ for the same in postal note, and 10¢ for sample package of leaflets to Mrs. N. E. Bergin Room 401. 1106 Baltimore Ave. Kansas City, Mo.

I will try to send the fifty new names. Shall I keep the Commission or must I send all names at the same time with the money?
