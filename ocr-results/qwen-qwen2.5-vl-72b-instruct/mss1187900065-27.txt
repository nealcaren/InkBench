**THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS**
Headquarters, Fourth Avenue cor. 22nd Street.

New York January 16 1885

To The Probate Judge of Hudson County N.J.

Sir I enclose herewith the Last Will and Testament of Miss Ottilia Assing, who died, as I am informed in the City of Paris, France August 21st 1884. I have decided not to offer the same for probate, because I do not propose to qualify as Executor; but in view of the fact of other persons having interests in the estate under the Will in question, I deem it my duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to your entertaining an Application for administration on the estate, with the Will annexed.

Pleas to state, however, that it is the intention of The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on the Owner of the trusts mentioned in the Will, to claim the property to which it is entitled.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect

Henry Bergh  
President.
