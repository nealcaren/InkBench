To the Speakers Bureau:

These roses were sweet, beautiful, temper displeasing, but
Roses sind Verboten.

Rich your money bodied the quiet to vindicate my
character. Please don't disobey orders again.
Have a vile temper, growing vile every day which
show what policies well do for a woman. It
is a daily comfort to witness the pleasantly of
the Speakers Bureau!
