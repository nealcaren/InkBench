CITY HALL,
East Rush & Co.,
Rochester, N.Y., Aug 17 1877â€”

Friend Douglas:

I started from Rochester yesterday morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake. Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamps a few miles north of the Rush Reservoir. I attached a pocket instrument upon the wire and communicated with the person who took my place during my absence. He telegraphed me the substance of your postal card. Before I left home I red your telegram, & went to the Rock Sav. Bk. where the draft was procured and notified them of its non reception, and of your wish for a duplicate. They said that they could not give another until they had received their copy from the Clearing House at N.Y. which would be the first week
