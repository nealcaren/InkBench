"Rosa Parks' precious gift, often overlooked by youth accustomed to the privileges they enjoy, is a blessing as well as a reminder. Because she helped to make my world better, I too must make the same commitment. I know that her struggle would be in vain if I did not make the most of the opportunities made available through her action. It is my responsibility to ensure that I explore each of the doors that were unlocked through the actions of Ms. Rosa Parks and others like her."

These lessons were ones I took to heart; I began to believe that I could make a change in my community and my life, all for the better."

This is why I have never and will never succumb to peer pressure. I think for my self and do what I think is right, not what others think is right for me."
