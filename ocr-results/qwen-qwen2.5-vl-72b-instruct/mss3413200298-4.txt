Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note about
Mrs. Blackwell go unanswered, even
if the check I wanted to send
must be omitted.

I have always admired Mrs. Blackwell,
and, in late years, have loved her
especially. Her always beautiful Christmas
and Easter messages, and her indomitable spiritual grace are such
indomitable spiritual grace are such
lonely additions to the great back-
ground of her life work.

It wrings my heart to know that
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.
There are so many who are! I am one
of them myself, or of course I would
share in making the fund which you
are raising. Being a starving artist
is a most painful handicap,
in every way, but it is particularly
hard to endure, when appeals like
this come.

Thank you for including me
as one of her friends, - which
I most heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett
