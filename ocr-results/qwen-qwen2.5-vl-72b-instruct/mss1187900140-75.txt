3. Newcastle upon Tyne  
Havestock Hill. 4th July  

My dear friend,

I regret much  
to waste your postage  
in sending what must  
be to you an unsatisfactory  
noteâ€”but I must as  
the bidding of the  
members of some of our  
Societies, state to you that  
the interests of your  
much new interesting  
paper will be ruined,  
if the papers are not
