(1) The Senseless Waste of War

When the great war began $7 billions of old war debts stood upon the books of Europe. The total coin money & bullion in circulation in the whole world was about eleven billions of dollars, yet the nations plunged full well into the war, borrowing all they could, printing paper money, not stopping to count the cost. At the end the international debts were so complicated & burdensome that a universal panic followed. What senseless waste! any wonder they can not pay their debts to us?

Do you know that every man killed in the late War cost the living $17800?
