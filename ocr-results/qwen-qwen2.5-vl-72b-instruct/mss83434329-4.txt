cure rather than a blessing. I would not, at once entirely emancipate him from the control of his master. But it should not be, as now, an arbitrary, unqualified control. For that control I would substitute the authority of law, which should be supreme. In saying this, sir, I do but carry out a principle which has long been dear to me as an American citizen—a principle which I have maintained, and still maintain, and shall continue to maintain, as a cardinal principle in my political creed, that, in opposition to all innovation and change, associated, self-constituted authority, THE LAWS should be maintained in full and uncontrolled supremacy. There is no being entitled to the appellation of man, who should not find in the laws theegis of their rights and ample protection. In applying this principle to the case of the slave, however, I would not confer upon him the same rights which are possessed by his master; and, for the obvious reason, that he is not fitted to enjoy them. But I would place him under the supervision of law made for his special benefit—under the protection of courts of justice, which should essentially qualify the control of the master over him—laws which should protect him in all the rights which he is fitted to enjoy, and prepare him for the enjoyment of those to which he would be a suicidal philanthropy immediately to confer upon him. Sir, owe it to this degraded race of men to prepare them for freedom—to communicate to them moral and religious and literary instruction—to restore and protect the domestic relations among them—to teach them the duties which they owe to God, and to their fellow-men—and to elevate them upon the foundation of a conscious responsibility to the government of Heaven and the authority of righteous human laws, a social structure which it shall be our glory to rear, and their highest earthly happiness to enjoy.

Thus, Mr. Speaker, while I thus repudiate the doctrine of the immediate and absolute abolition of slavery, I maintain the duty of immediately and absolutely abolishing the slave trade within the limits of this District. And here I come to a part of the subject which gentlemen do not choose to approach, but manifestly desire to avoid. In this I commend them not. The slave trade is an evil for which they well know there is no defense, and no palliation, no regret, sir, that I have not the means of ascertaining its extent and character within this District. But the fact that I have no such means furnishes a strong argument for referring the petitions to a select committee, rather for the purpose of going into all the questions making up the report of the facts connected with this traffic. I can, at present, only say, I am well assured that the trade is actively carried on in the cities both of Washington and Alexandria,* especially in the latter, where is a large receptacle for the security of slaves brought into this District from the surrounding country; from which they are, from time to time, shipped to supply the markets in the Southern and Southwestern ports of the United States. I need not say that what is usually connected with the slave trade elsewhere is connected with it here—the forced and final separation of parents and children, of brothers and sisters, of husbands and wives—the utter annihilation of all the endearing relations of human life and the substitution of the single relation which properly bears to its absolute proprietor.

The following advertisements appear, daily, in the principal newspapers in this city:

"CASH FOR 200 NEGROES,

Including both sexes, from twelve to twenty-five years of age. Persons having likely servants to dispose of, will find it to their interest to give me a call. I will give higher prices in cash, than any other purchaser who is now in this market. I can at all times be found at the Mechanics' Hall, now kept by B. O. Sheckell, and formerly kept by Isaac Beers, on Seventh street, between F and G streets, below Lloyd's Tavern, and the Centre Market. All communications promptly attended to.

JAMES BIRCH."

"CASH FOR 500 NEGROES,

Including both sexes, from twelve to twenty-five years of age. Persons having likely servants to dispose of, will find it to their interest to give us a call, as we will give higher prices in cash, than any other purchaser who is now, or may hereafter come into market.

FRANKLIN & ARMFIELD."

more obvious than the danger of failing to accomplish at once all that an ardent philanthropy may desire.

I have said that the public sentiment at the North is not understood upon this subject. I believe, sir, it is greatly misunderstood. A large majority of the people are opposed to certain views and measures, connected with the proposed abolition of slavery in the States; but they entertain, at the same time, an irreconcilable aversion to the institution of slavery, in all its forms, and to almost every conceivable aspect of the system furnished in all the proceedings at the North, which have been adverted to, in this debate, as an index of public sentiment there. Thus the preamble to the Boston resolutions declares—"We hold this truth to be indisputable, that the condition of slavery finds no advocate in our hearts. Our laws do not authorize it; our principles revolt against it; our citizens will not tolerate its existence among them."

This, sir, expresses, I believe, the universal sentiment at the North on this subject. It is a sentiment which is not the production of a momentary excitement, but the result of the sober and settled convictions of the public mind. And, sir, let me assure gentlemen that no expressions of disapprobation in regard to the measures of "abolitionists," or doubts as to the practicability of immediate emancipation, are to be taken as evidence that the principles of the Northern people have undergone any change whatever; or that they will not avail themselves of every suitable occasion to discuss it, as well as of all reasonable and constitutional means of remedying the evil. The slavery of the States they know they cannot reach, but by moral influence; and that influence they think can be made so effective, though kind and respectful, though earnest and urgent appeals to the Southern interest and the Southern conscience. But slavery here, they regard as within the competency of national legislation, and hold themselves, in common with the whole country, directly responsible for its continuance. And I need hardly say that they are deeply sensible of the reproach, and indignantly resent the imputation, that they do not mean seriously and immediately taken, looking to its final abolition; and especially that what has, by almost the whole civilized world, no longer be suffered to go unpunished and unrebuked in the capital of the Republic.

The venerable member from Massachusetts (Mr. Adams) has said, and said truly, that opposition to slavery is, with the people of the North, a religious principle. An honorable gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Jones) requests, by asking, sir, what is the great, leading, moral precept put forth by that Savior whose name is thus invoked to sanction the existence of slavery? "ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO UNTO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM."

Sir, I will attempt no commentary on this precept. It needs none. I will only say that it contains the seminal principle of the pure and elevated morality of Christianity—morality so congenial with the spirit and so constantly enforced by the example of its Divine Author, while upon earth.

Now, sir, let gentlemen show me that Africans are not "men;" and I will give up the argument. But, until this is done, until this declaration is blotted from the Book of Revelation, that "God hath made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell on all the face of the earth?" and until this great truth ceases to find a response in every human bosom, shall slavery stand rebuked by this all-comprehensive and sublime precept of the Saviour of mankind, also enjoins submission to the "powers that be." The same mouth which uttered it said, "render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's"—a precept coincident with that which exhorts—"servants be obedient to your own masters;" not answering again, nor purloining; but showing all good fidelity. The Savior made no part of his business, while upon earth, to subvert the existing order of things, or to prescribe specific regulations for the administration of civil government. But he came to redeem men from sin—to write the law of love upon their hearts—to establish principles and proclaim precepts, before whose searching and all-piercing influence, the most honored systems of injustice and oppression shall melt away.

Permit me now, Mr. Speaker, to examine, for a few moments, some of the objections which are urged against the legislation of Congress on this subject.

In the first place, it is asserted that Congress has no right to legislate on this subject; that, however great may be the evil of slavery or the slave trade within this District, it is an evil which must be borne, since authority to remedy it is not to be found among the powers granted in the Constitution.

And what are the powers of Congress touching this subject? Is not Congress authorized to extend its jurisdiction to the high seas even to the coast of Africa, and to prohibit the traffic in slaves, under the penalty of death, while it is powerless to reach the same evil in the very heart of the Republic? If the grant of powers must be so construed—if there is clearly no authority by which Congress can act in this matter, then must we submit to the evil, and wait an amendment of the Constitution, which shall make it consistent with itself, and save the country from reproach.

But, sir, fortunately for the country, the Constitution, through which we derive our powers, is not defective. The power to legislate upon this subject is granted, and that, not by remote implication, but in terms of obvious and familiar import. The 8th section of the first article gives to Congress authority "to exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of Government of the United States."

In the first place, let it be observed, the power of Con-
