FREEDMEN'S BUREAU
11

"VI. Brigadier General R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plantations, and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or desired in the settlement now on Beaufort island, nor will any rights to property heretofore acquired be affected thereby.

"By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:
L. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant General."

In Virginia quite an amount of land was libelled and about to be sold by the marshal just previous to the establishment of the bureau, when the sales were suspended by the Secretary of War, in order that these lands might be turned over to the bureau for the benefit of the freedmen. I claimed that these lands, which had been condemned to sale, though not actually sold, were already the property of the government, and objected to his excellency the President against the insertion of the word "sold" in the definition of confiscated property. The President referred the matter to the Attorney General, whereupon, finally, the word "sold" was inserted.

This decision necessitated the restoration of all the property where the sale had been suspended. I have been very desirous of conforming to the letter of the law in setting apart lands, but was unwilling to do so before it became probable that they could be retained. In this way much disappointment and suffering would be avoided.

The freedmen were so eager for the possession of land, and so likely, without that possession in fact or in prospect, to be obliged to leave their present homes, that I made the following proposition through yourself:

WAR DEPARTMENT,
BUREAU OF REFUGEES, FREEDMEN, AND ABANDONED LANDS,
Washington, September 4, 1865.

SIR: The matter of imposing some conditions in the cases of pardoning those who have lands already under cultivation by freedmen, for the benefit of this class of persons, having been presented to me by the Attorney General, and a plan having been suggested by a distinguished officer of the army, which I heartily indorsed, I deem it best to combine these suggestions in the following proposals, to wit:

1st. That hereafter pardons of the President of the United States, extended to those who have been excepted in his proclamation of May 29, 1865, having more than 20,000 dollars' worth of property, be conditioned by specific stipulation in each individual case: that the land-owner agree to set apart and grant title, in fee-simple, to each head of family of his former slaves, a homestead varying in extent from five to ten acres, to be secured against alienation during the lifetime of the grantee. The location, precise extent, and other details to be determined by three referees, two to be chosen by the interested parties, each selecting one, and the two a third.

2d. That other persons, not land-holders, be conditioned according to their several circumstances by equivalent or proper stipulation, to be determined by a committee of three appointed by the President.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,
Major General, Commissioner.

Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

I felt quite sanguine that this course would produce contentment among the freedmen, and afford an example to other land-owners beside those affected by it. My proposition may have come too late for adoption, for already quite a number of land-owners had been pardoned.

RECORDSâ€”OF LABOR.

By Circular No. 5 I empowered the Assistant Commissioners to do everything possible to "quicken and direct the industry of the refugees and freedmen, that they and their communities may do all that can be done for the season, already so far advanced, to prevent starvation and suffering, and promote good order and prosperity." * * * "Negroes must be free to choose their
