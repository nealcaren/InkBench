What put it into an active state, I cannot understand. We have had a month's rain. I believe it is good for a troublesome as it ends. Michigan looks delightfully fresh, clean, green, & rolling. I begin to feel better at once.

I will write up some letters neglected. I often here & write look to all the cares, & kindred of my heart.

I was more than glad to get my Mammy's letter, written when here was little else, at Aurora.
