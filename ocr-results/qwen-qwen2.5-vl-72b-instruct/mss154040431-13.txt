**War Time Illegitimacy**

**ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%**
"Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race," Berlin Councillor Declares.

AMSTERDAM, Dec. 12. (Associated Press.)â€”Ten per cent. of the children born in Prussia in wartime are illegitimate, according to a statement made in the Prussian House of Representatives in the debate on the vital statistics. Dr. Engel, Inc. member in Vorwarts, makes the statement that this large proportion of illegitimate children is evidence of the moral healthiness of the German race. He contends an appeal for the withdrawal of all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children.

"The trouble fact, however, is that only 136 out of every 1,000 illegitimate children reach their ninth year as compared with 978 in the case of legitimate children. The death rate of illegitimate children is twice as high as that of legitimate children. The situation of unmarried mothers is very precarious. There should be a uniform birth certificate, and women who were engaged to fighters should bear the title 'Frau.'

"Women owing to the card system, is a torture for the unmarried mother. Every journey for a food card is a path of thorns and a source of mortification and humiliation. In the card office and in the shops, she must again and again make confession of her fault. The awards to the married women have many obstacles and much mental torture."

The number of illegitimate mothers in Prussia, Dr. Engel states, has now reached a total of nearly 200,000 yearly.
