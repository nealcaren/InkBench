sober, ascertaining the address of his family, go with him to
the express office and with his consent forward it to them,
leaving him enough to pay his fare home and follow on after.
We had several such cases.

Many ways of cheating the men were constantly practiced,
and with the utmost vigilance we could hardly stop it; backed
up as the rascals were by some of the judges elected by the
people. A case reported in the Evening Post, of May 31st, in
which Mr. Kennedy, our energetic and faithful Superintendent
of the Police, was arrested for contempt of court, for not
immediately letting one of these rascals go, is as follows:

CHEATING SOLDIERS.

THE ARREST OF MR. KENNEDYâ€”CASE OF COLONEL COLYER AND THE JEWISH
CLOTHIER ALKERS.

The fact of the arrest of Mr. Kennedy on a writ of contempt, issued by Judge
Cardozo, and his subsequent return, has already been published. The facts in
relation to the arrest of Morris Alkers, in whose behalf the writ of habeas corpus
was issued, were not published. It appears that Alkers keeps a clothing store
in Canal street. On several occasions he has visited the Soldiers' Depot corner
of Howard and Mercer streets, where he distributed his business cards, which
had a Masonic emblem at the top.

By this means he secured a number of customers among the soldiers, and the
Superintendent says he regularly cheated those dealing with him. One week
ago last Sunday afternoon, Alkers visited the depot during divine service, and
persuaded eight Western men from General Sherman's army to visit his store,
where he sold each of them a suit of clothes, ranging from fifty to one hundred
and twenty dollars each. Three or four of these men went west the same
evening. The next morning one of the others showed his clothing to the officers
in the depot, and was told that he had been grossly deceived.

He was advised to go to Brooks Brothers and learn the value of the goods,
which he did. He was informed that a suit of clothing for which he had paid
eighty dollars could be bought for thirty dollars. Colonel Colyer then made
the facts known to Superintendent Kennedy, who detailed a detective to make
the man refund the money. Alkers did pay the soldier fifty dollars, retaining
thirty dollars for the clothing. The other soldiers who had remained in the city,
learning of the success of their comrade, visited the merchant and received more
than half of the money they had originally paid. To one of the men Alkers gave
two suits of clothing rather than refund any money.

At the request of the Colonel, Superintendent Kennedy detailed an officer
at the depot, with instructions to prevent Alkers from visiting the building and
distributing any of his cards, or enticing the men into his store. He persisted,
however, and yesterday was arrested while hawking his cards in front of the
depot in Howard street, and not in front of his own store, as was previously
reported."
