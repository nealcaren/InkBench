Bridport Dorsetshire  
October 9th 1866  

My dear Dr. Douglass,

On our return from our three-months' tour through France Italy & Switzerland we spent a few days at Woodstock Bristol before reaching Bridport â€“ And there we found your kind welcome letter awaiting us. It is always a great pleasure to receive one of your nice long letters, & this one dated May 3rd was as usual full & interesting. I trust you will have no more such adventures as the one you describe as having taken place in Baltimore last winter. It was a mercy that you escaped uninjured, but you might not be so fortunate another time, so do be prudent as to where & how you travel and remember how very valuable
