Grandpa was never called "Floyd"
He was first Frederick Bailey the slave
Changed to Johnson when he ran
away; and because the man in
whose home he lived in New Bedford
Mass. was named Johnson; this man
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admired

their two Johnson names, he would
would like to call himself
Douglass instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another and hence-
forth set out — to be called
Frederick Douglass.
These are facts — not hearsay.

Later — Just rec'd. letter from Fred — he
leaves on his "debating tour" to-day —
and really debates at Harvard. He
will stop with [?]. I've already writ[???] Joe's
wife & Mamie and Aunt [?] [????].
