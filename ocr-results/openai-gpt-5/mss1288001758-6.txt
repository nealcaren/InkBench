That may do for Summer—

Just this moment comes the
letter boy with your letter
thank you dear dear—I
sympathize with the pang
you feel at Mr [?]’s
decline, But all
things work together for good
to good souls as you, so
Mary dear never mind,
There must be something good
for Jim somewhere, because
I assure it I am glad
the children are as good as
[?] pie, I hope they will
keep so, Tell Mary I want
[?] brine on the butter—
Please look and see if there
is any— Love to Mother &
all— But most to you.
