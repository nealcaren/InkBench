I’m sorry, but most of the page is too small and blurry for me to read reliably, and it’s printed upside down. I can make out the footer “BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA. 77,” but the tabular list of names, ranks, companies, and regiments is not legible enough to transcribe accurately.

If you can provide a higher‑resolution scan or cropped, right‑side‑up images of the page in sections, I’ll transcribe it completely.
