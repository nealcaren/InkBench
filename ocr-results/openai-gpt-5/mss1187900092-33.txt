quite anxious to see both. That is one of the greatest difficulty about this place, I am unable to keep up with current events unless the papers are sent from home, and I miss reading the daily papers very much.

Hoping that I have not put your eyes to a very severe test; and that you will favor me with an early reply, I will close, with much love I am,

Your aff. grand-daughter,
Hattie.
