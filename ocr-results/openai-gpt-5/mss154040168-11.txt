with enthusiasm: they have been much
appreciated â€” more than you can know.
I am longing to hear who is going to
Rome, how and when. I am as ignorant
as a [?] regarding [?]; I am beginning
to worry lest the mail I most need reach
Panama after I am gone. You have
been the best correspondent for your
letters are always here when I arrive.
I learn that mail is not carried by
this boat to N. Y. but put off at Key
West and goes up by railroad; you will
get this soon. It is not for Panama.
Please accept my collective letter
as one for you. I must go to dress now.
I want to be [?]. The mid-dinner is 4 or
before.  Lovingly indeed!
