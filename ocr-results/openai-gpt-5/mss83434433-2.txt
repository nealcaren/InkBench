Dear Sir

I have thought of an expedient to bring in Caroline which I submit to you. It is this, Genl Moseley is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi Monday [?] you [?] dispense with Janet & see Genl [?] & let her go [?] his negro & get it out that he has bought her for 12 months I am sure bring her in & let it be understood it is an mere arrangement of mine over which you have no control: What do you think of it? let me know

Yrs truly
John H Lewis
