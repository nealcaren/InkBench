Washington D.C.
Nov 6th /64

Dear Father,

Yours of the 3 inst. is just received.
I saw an account of one of your lectures in New
Jersey published in the N.Y. Tribune, and I thought
that you might have other appointments, not hearing
from you. All are well except the baby, he has a severe
cold Dr. Magruder is attending him, we are afraid he
will have the croup; but hope not. I dont wish to trouble
your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and my
self I know your mind & time is better occupied. You
may know the cause of the difficulty; but believe you dont
know the whole truth, and it is hard to find it out under
the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone
against us, I look for another war. If you will be at home
any length of time I will write again soon, as I am
very busy just now. Libbie would send love, if she knew
I was writing. Love to mother and all.

Your aff. son
Chas. R. Douglass
