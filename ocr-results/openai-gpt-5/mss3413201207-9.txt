Lynn Mass., Dec. 1/81
Editor Woman's Journal,
Dear Madam,
Enclosed you will find $2,50, which I send to pay for the Woman's journal, to be sent to my address, for one year. I have hitherto received the paper through a friend, but I think I will have one of my own now, so that I can have some to give away,
I received your letter last Monday, and I wish to thank you for your evidently careful perusal of my manuscript, and for your friendly criticism of my work. I feel more encouraged by your commendations

[*Please have this ready tomorrow*]
