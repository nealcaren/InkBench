Dear Mr Douglas

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you or heard from you, and
I write now in hopes of pro-
voking a reply. We really are
very much in the dark about
you, & dont even know whether
you still hold office under the
Government, as we have not heard
to the contrary I conclude that you
do, & therefore that you have not
been lecturing & holding meetings
over the country this last winter
as of old. I hope that your health
is good - & that you can report
well of yourself & of your family
