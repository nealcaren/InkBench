wider public of readers,- I hope
that it will have the good effect of
keeping the Negroes of the North
from deserting the Republican
Party,- a suicidal step it would
be for them, as your strong and
unanswerable arguments clearly
show; these arguments, coming from
you, must have great weight with
the colored people, who are the
ones you especially want to influence
just now. I thought relieved from
office you are working away
with all your old power. I
hope that you are keeping through
the winter in good health; that
you will not run any risks by
travelling or lecturing till summer
comes again. When you last
wrote you were in some anxiety

about one of your boys, who was ill.
I hope that he has [?] recovered,
& that all your family are well.
I hoped that the book of
Mr Carpenter’s sermons & a few
other writings, which my nephew
Prof. Estlin Carpenter of Oxford is
editing, would have been out by
this time, but it will be [?]
or later before it appears; it is
entitled “Personal & Social Chris-
tianity” & is prefaced by a short
Memoir by Miss H. J. Cooke.
I am going about the 20th Dec.
for a few weeks to my sister
Mrs Blake’s. I find it hard to
leave home: but my friends
must [?] me to it, & I think
will be well to do so. I have
now been about six weeks [?]
