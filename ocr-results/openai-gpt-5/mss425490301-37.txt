MRS. ELIZA WARNER
President Emeritus
California

The California State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs was organized in Oakland in 1906 by Mrs. Eliza Warner of Los Angeles, California. For many years Mrs. Warner has been an outstanding character in the church, fraternal and civic life of the State of California and has given the better part of her service for the protection of womanhood, home and child.

Realizing the benefit derived from contact with greater powers, the California State joined the great National Federation in 1908, and became a part of the National program for a part of the State.

During the 28 years of the State Federation a great deal of study and instruction were given to organizing women over the State. The State itself and instead of the one State organizer, an organizer was elected for each section of the State and many clubs were brought into the State work.

Aside from carrying out the State program many clubs in the various sections have built and maintained Institutional Homes for young women and children. Some of these are: Sojourner Truth Industrial Home, Los Angeles; Women’s Day Nursery, Los Angeles; Fanny Wall Children’s Home and Day Nursery, Oakland; East Side Mother’s Home, San Francisco; and Madam C. J. Walker’s Home, San Francisco. These institutions became the monuments of the Federation and caused a Memorial Day to be held at each State Convention.

The State gives an annual scholarship which began in 1916.
