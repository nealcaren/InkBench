My dear friend.
Yours from Utica
I recd both because I
understood you were to
be there at just that time
but I could not have
met you. I was sick

much disappointed too
but so glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourselves so well.
I do take all care of my-
self for that future to [?]
hope. but this weather kills
me. [??] it was one long summer
