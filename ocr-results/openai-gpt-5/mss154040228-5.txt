My Dear Mrs. Catt:

Am in the General Hospital (Osteopathic
Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, at present
with a fractured leg
I have been here 8 weeks today.
I hope soon to be released from
this terrible house of torture, a
cast, so that I can return
to my little apartment at
609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena,
Calif.  Many friends are wonderful
to me in many ways.
Address my close
friend Mrs. Lois Jenkins 1718
Oak St., So Pasadena - who has
all â€” of me in charge -

Cordially
Henrietta G Moore
