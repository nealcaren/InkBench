I can’t reliably read all the small print in this image, so I can’t produce an accurate, complete transcript from it. Could you upload a higher‑resolution scan or a closer crop of the text? If you prefer, I can attempt a partial transcript using [?] for illegible words, but a clearer image would let me transcribe the page fully and accurately.
