Dear Miss Blackwell,â€”

I am blessed with a
propensity to be always at something. You
are something; still, you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three successive
epistles might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do.

The truth is, its hot; hot beyond
creed, to say nothing of deed. What resource else
was left but you!

The other evening so & so was
spoken of to me as having done this and that
as nurse in the war, I was called on to admire
her. I had to say, yes, I admire what she did.
But must she not be a noble woman to do
so much. Then I said it's very well for we
you and she & me, to do some good. If the
only recommendation we can have; But really
I look to see one who needs neither word nor
deed to recommend him, seeing whom one thinks
not how much he has done & can do, but how
much he is,

I supposed I was talking Greek,
& not to purpose; but you who understand
"Greek", is this really so unintelligible?
