were at your house! Nevertheless
Should you come, a father's house,
a father's welcome will be given you.  You would
find me in very pleasant surroundings,
not quite such as I have on Cedar
Hillâ€”yet very well adapted to
this climate and country.  I
note what you say of young
Cooke.  I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress,
but am more sorry still to
know that he served Annie
such a mean trick.  She
did a good deal for him. That
is perhaps, the trouble, Had she
done less she would have
received more thanks.  Gratitude
is not a very strong feature
of the Colored race,
