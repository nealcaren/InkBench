[* Concerning Bequest of Books *]

September 28, 1937.

Mrs. Mary R. Beard,
New Milford, Conn.

Dear Mrs. Beard:

I am only trying to fill in some deficiencies in my library. There were some books which appeared before I arrived in this world that I have never seen and I am sure they would be only amusing and not in the least valuable, but I am sure that some of the old suffragists must have had Some of these books and I am trying to chase them down.

When and if I am able to complete my collection, I shall write and tell you what I have and we will consider what to do with them.

I am very glad you got as good a start as you have. I think that our American history should remain in this country, but the women in Amsterdam have had such a remarkable start that I think their archives will turn out to be of great authority and importance in Europe. A bountiful space, for which there is no charge for rent, houses the Amsterdam archives.

I shall make no disposition of my collection until I have consulted you.

Sincerely,

CCG:HW.
