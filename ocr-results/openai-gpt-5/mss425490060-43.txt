hiccoughs and was very
near death when a visitor
to him, Dr Bigger, one of
our dentists here, said
he could cure him, and
Just one drop of
turpentine on his navel,
the hiccoughs stopped
and he is up and about

tried everything without
avail and as this cannot

We have too few men
of the caliber of Judge
Terrell, to lose them, if
anything can be done to
save themâ€”and I trust
by the time this reaches
you, you will not need
this or any other remedy,
that your husband will
be well on the road to
recovery.
