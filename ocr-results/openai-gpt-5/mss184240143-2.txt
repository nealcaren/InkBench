My dear Mr. [?]

I am afraid your business
affairs are again suffering. You have
not the [?] [?] to carry
most weight. “Nice” a man so smiling
but “can’t keep a Hotel.” I am sorry
think that if experience your “boss”
with John McCullough it might have
been now in a different position—

You told me you would see me about
your theatrical business & the next I hear
you have “a Boy” (as [?]) [?] [?]
with your affairs & “mixing those children
up.” I thought you had a dear experience
before with “Amateur manager” & had
learned by experience the needs of management
Don’t think I am scolding you only that I
feel slighted. I could do more for you than any
man in this business, or one of [?] so that
matters [?] (or will) have been done cheerfully.
