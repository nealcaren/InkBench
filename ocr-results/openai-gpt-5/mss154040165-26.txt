Captains instructions and some Dennison crape paper
describing the two varieties. She didn’t get anything
my letter to Ch’n Com. Daniels definitely stated they
could have the circulars at 83[?]—100. Just why
any one in that office shouldn’t know crape paper
is a mystery. I should think they might think the
campaign consist[?] mostly of paper[?].
Result is that Rochester d[?]n’t get to head-
quarters [?] for May 2, and the Captains
galleys for my Conference cannot take the
[galley]s home with them. That is a long
way from efficiency. Please see what is
the matter and who doesn’t know crape
paper — I could scarcely believe her.

Hastily

See you Wednesday a m I mean to stay
home Tuesday afternoon I’ll get it by noon if
any mails.
Geneva Sunday.
