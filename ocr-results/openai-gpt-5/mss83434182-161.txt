I want to provide an accurate, complete transcript, but the text in this image is too small to read clearly—most of the table entries (names, dates, regiments, grave numbers, etc.) are illegible at this resolution. 

What I can see:
- Page header: “156” and “UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN”
- Section title: “NATCHEZ NATIONAL CEMETERY, MISSISSIPPI—Continued.”
- Table column headings (left to right): 
  No.; Name; Rank; Co.; Regiment; Date of death; Sec.; Grave.; Original place of burial.

To finish a complete transcription, please upload a higher-resolution image (or a cropped/zoomed version of the table). Once I can read the entries, I’ll transcribe every row exactly as printed.
