"There were a number of
Boise Peace Quilt Project
members who helped make
your quilt - not by creating
blocks or strips, but
rather by contributing
many hours and many
more tiny stitches to
enhance the pieces
made by others. A
picture here of Regina
Brown acknowledges
their commitment to
your award."
