farewells are n[????]
I remember you through your
dear Frederick's d[????] last words
but—At all say for
myself, that I never [????]
my dear Saviour [????] near—
my very dear sorrow [????] now—Amidst
of precious [??] now—Amidst
the many trials, & heart[??]
the many trials, & disappointments I
have gone through, I can
realize that “all things”
[????] are working

May our loving Heavenly Father
bless you [f??] ever, may
your love faithful and
affectionate friend,
