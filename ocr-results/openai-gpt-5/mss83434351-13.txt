I’m sorry, but much of this ledger page is too small and faint to read at this resolution. I can only make out a few pieces of text with confidence. If you can upload a higher‑resolution image or close-up crops, I’ll provide a full, line‑by‑line transcription.

What I can read:

- December 31st 1866 (appears multiple times)
- Total to be accounted for
- Abstract of Issues of Clothing Camp & Garrison Equipage to [?]

A partial list of article names that are legible in the right-hand column:
- Sack coat
- Trowsers
- Shirt [wht?]
- Shirt [flannel?]
- Shoes [bootees?]
- Stockings [wool?]
- Great coat
- Haversack
- Canteen [strap]
- Knapsack

Please provide a clearer image so I can transcribe all headings, names, and numbers exactly as written.
