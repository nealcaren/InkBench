EDITOR’S PORTFOLIO.

We have received a number of letters from young correspondents who have been getting subscribers for us, and getting at the same time handsome prizes for themselves. (See page 3 of cover.) One little girl sent three subscribers, and we sent her a nice silver fruit-knife. She then thought she would like another to present to her dear grandmother; so she sent us three more, and got another fruit-knife. Another little girl wanted a croquet set, and sent us twenty full subscribers. Others have got wallets, books, note-paper, &c. Will our little readers help us to establish “THE NURSERY” prosperously by doing a similar work?

For seven full subscribers we will send one of the excellent Craig microscopes with a prepared object-glass, all ready for use.

OSCAR PLETSCH.—The well-known critic of “The Boston Transcript,” who writes under the name of “Tom Folio,” says,—

“What Landseer is to dogs, what Rosa Bonheur is to horses, what Morland is to pigs, what Teniers is to Dutch boors, Oscar Pletsch is to children,—their painter, interpreter, immortalizer. It has been said that Pletsch has never had a superior, and probably not an equal, in his specialty of sketching children. For presenting the American public with the best drawings of this admirable artist, Mrs. Fanny P. Seaverns deserves the thanks of all lovers of art. If you would obtain an idea of Pletsch’s genius,—his humor, truth, geniality, and beauty,—buy a set of ‘The Nursery,’ and carefully examine his designs. If you are not charmed with his ‘Keeping Shop,’ ‘A Young Hair-dresser,’ ‘The Professor,’ ‘A Hard Day’s Wash,’ ‘I’ve Been A-Maying,’ ‘You Can’t Come In,’ ‘The Children’s Auction,’ ‘A Morning Call,’ ‘Cooking Dinner,’ ‘Getting Ready for Breakfast,’ &c., I advise you not to set up for a connoisseur.”

This admirable artist is now engaged upon some designs made expressly for “The Nursery,” and which will appear in our numbers for 1868. Three of Pletsch’s drawings appear in this number, as will be seen by our Table of Contents.
