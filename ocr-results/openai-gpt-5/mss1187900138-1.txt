Hon Fred Douglass
Dear Sir.

Francis M Adlington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age sends the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration
“Father Abraham’s monument.”

This Monument would seem to Say
That Lincoln’s dead, but ’tis not so.
In Vain the assassin’s aim to slay;
In Vain his blood Was made to flow.
In Vain the Vile attempt to Kill.
In all our hearts he’s living still.
And While a drop of patriot blood
Shall flow in any human frame
Will thrill at Memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln’s Name.

This Monument We raise to thee
Great Chief whose Mandate Made us free
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
For Thee, our true and Constant friend.

Also the following
Address to America Personified
The World is gazing on thee.
Dispose Thy robes With Care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy Golden hair.

“Over”
