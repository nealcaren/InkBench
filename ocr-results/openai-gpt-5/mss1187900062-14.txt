Hartford, Connecticut,

4th If the colored leaders take to denouncing the Supreme Court, they will alienate the sympathies of the best people in the North; the abolition of slavery; the prohibition of discriminating state laws; the extension of the ballot to the colored man: these are secure. If the colored leaders denounce anybody for acts not also punished by law, the acknowledged duty and sound [?] of the colored people [s????] particular private [?] wrongs, [r????] or protest & threaten, it will look rather childish; it will tend to show that the colored people care more for the show than for the substance of citizenship.
