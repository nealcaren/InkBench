Dear Mary: I received a book yesterdayâ€”the 24th gift this spring! If this book tells how to attain success with a book when the author (would-be) has neither sense nor [?] and no vocabulary to express the queer thoughts she has, it will be most welcome. Until I have read it I shall not know whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or [?] another way! I am sending you [a box] as you said do. This is no gift; just a tiny box of slips I have. I [love] the tiniest little blossoms. [?] there are but me in just such [?]. If you were nearer I should have given you a gardenful of plants from the greenhouse, all of which [?] are in my garden now and have produced little blossoms. They must be stalwart wonders in yours! When you come down I shall take you to see a garden that is worth looking at.
