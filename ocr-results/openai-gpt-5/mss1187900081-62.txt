[?] Douglass Esq.

Dear Sir;

The inclosed clippings from the Kansas City Times of the 25th, I inclose to you for your verification, or denial of, repor[?]s of your late addresses, and friends in this state, have read the inclosed with much surprise and sorrow. We have been induced to believe that both New York, and Indiana could be fully relied upon to cast their electoral vote for our gallant standard bearers, Harrison and Morton. A reply, either confirming or denying the inclosed, will greatly oblige.

Yours &c
H. L. Steinmey[?]
