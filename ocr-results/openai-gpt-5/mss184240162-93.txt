man or black - I would have
been so treated in either case.
As to taking him out to fight
E. said, any soldier would have
much prefered the chance of
being killed in battle to death
by Court Martial, so that there
was no aggravation in that.
I wish you would inquire &
examine before you take it again
I print it in Washington if you
can - something else will do,
better any way it seems to me.
And then please bring in
now 35th - U. S. Col’d Inf.
1 North Car - their roll-call of
54th - if you can. The facts of
the two are that 54th went in with
over a thousand men in excellent
conditions as to arms, equip-
ment & health - was exposed to
accurate fire & next morning
found all but 100 men on duty &
3 officers only, slightly wounded.
The 1st North Carolina were
double quicked the last mile -
came into the hottest fire of the
whole action - a few rods only from
the fresh enemy - from guns - &
only 600 men at the start - came out
68 killed; 131; 299 - officers
killed - eight severely wounded.
Gen. Gillmore’s staff (two of them)
told me, there was no other under-
standing in that quarter, than that
the 54th did the best fighting on the
field unless it was 7th Conn. (Col.
Hawley) - & Hawley [?] was witness-
ing close by them - ([?] regiment).
