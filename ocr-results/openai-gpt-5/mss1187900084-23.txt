that all thoughtful people, or
who have the good of the African
race at heart will agree with
you in the broadly philosophic[?]
and wise view you have taken of
the subject. Will your address
be published in pamphlet
form? If so, I shall order
some for circulation. There is
not a word or thought in it
that I would have changed
in any respect. Again I beg to
thank you for laying before the
American people so valuable
and timely an address, I wish
you would send a copy to
our common friend Cyrus
McNeely, Hopedale, Harrison Co.
Ohio. He is of the old Aboli-

tionists of Ohio, of whom I for
one, hold in peculiar honor. Please
put some mark on it by which he will know
from whom he receives it. Do you
ever come east in these days?
Should you come to this City
remember you have a carte
Blanche, which if you follow it,
will take you to my house
86 North Oxford St â€”

Faithfully Yours
