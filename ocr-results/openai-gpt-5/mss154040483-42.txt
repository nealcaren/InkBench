…ture was started in the Northwest at an attempt has been made to start a similar co-operative delivery system in Cleveland, Ohio. Numerous other attempts are being made to solve the problem of distribut[?]; spread. In Cincinnati, for example, the farmers have formed a cooperative association and are building a large plant of their own to deliver milk to the housewives’ door. In other communities farmers are also working out short cuts to the consumer.

“Licensing”
(Continued from page 17)

Third Assembly be promptly taken, the date for the next regular meeting of the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Women and Children was advanced by several months. And it was at this meeting that our American representative, Miss Grace Abbott of the Children’s Bureau, went as an “unofficial observer.”

The full report of the action of that Committee has just now been given out. This informs us that the fullest possible consideration was given to the plan for licensing which, after much discussion, was finally adopted. In this discussion two very important points were raised and were finally crystallized into resolutions. One was to recommend thorough questionnaires be sent to all members of the League asking all countries that have a system of licensing to use it for a report on its working and results; and those that have abolished it for a statement of the reasons that led them to do so. The other urges the use of women police in dealing with prostitution.

But, says the report, particular importance attaches to that resolution which embodies the proposal made by the “unofficial observer” from the United States. This was that the Council might, without delay, appoint experts to make, in collaboration with the governments of the countries concerned, a comprehensive study of the conditions under which this traffic goes on, the methods practiced and the main centers between which it prevails. Again, it is seen, the mighty weapon of publicity is to be used. Light is to be turned upon this darkest spot in our social organism. It is hardly credible that, when the full facts are laid out for the world’s attention, governments and people will not be stirred to some determined positive action against the abuses.

When these resolutions of the Advisory Committee have passed through the necessary technical stages, they will be referred to the various national legislatures for ratification. Adequate provision for local enforcement must, then, be passed. And when that is done, as Mr. Shields, alternate from Australia, said at the time of the discussion in the Third Assembly, the greatest blow ever dealt the traffic will have been struck.


THE WOMAN CITIZEN

Your Investments
By ELEANOR KEESE

TWO policies issued by life insurance companies which are very popular and which are more or less on the endowment order mentioned in our last article, are income bonds and retirement annuities.

Many women—and men, too, of course—who have no one dependent on them and who wish to provide themselves with savings from which to receive an income in the future, find the purchase of income bonds one of the safest methods of assuring this. The purchaser makes annual payments until a certain age, after which the insurance company pays her a fixed amount monthly for the rest of her life. Should she die before reaching this age, the insurance company usually agrees to return to the heirs the total amount of the deposits which have been made. If the insured dies after having reached the stipulated age and received some of the income payments, but not the aggregate equal to the entire amount deposited as premiums, the difference is usually returned to the heirs.

The cost of income bonds, and the amount of present income the deposit earns, varies greatly according to the age at which payment can begin and the exact monthly income desired. A person of sixty, for example, wishing to receive ten dollars monthly beginning at once, would pay an annual premium of about $341.41, and the same amount for each additional ten dollars of income desired. A person of thirty who could let the income begin after twenty years would pay an annual premium of about $83.41, and the same amount for each additional ten dollars of income desired. At the end of the twenty years the total premium and accumulated interest would be about $822.36. Disregarding the fact that the interest is paid at the end of twenty or thirty years, the interest received at present amounts to a little over 2 per cent on the accumulated deposits in the latter case, and approximately 1 1/2 per cent in the former case. The profit to the insurer on these annuities comes, of course, in the fact that interest on the money as it is accumulating during the twenty or thirty year periods is not paid out, but goes into the company’s treasury. From a business man’s point of view this makes the income very small—though the returns in present income after the age of fifty or sixty represent only about one-half the interest rate indicated because, during this time, the capital has had a chance to increase 50 per cent to 100 per cent.

Retirement annuities are used by many women as a very satisfactory method of saving regularly. After a certain number of years during which the premiums are kept up, these policies partake in the profits of the company and dividends are applied toward purchasing paid-up additions. The same principle is practically the same thing, though differently named. The premium at forty is $105 a year. This would provide for a woman a retirement annuity of $10.50 a month for life beginning at the age of fifty, and of $8.50 a month for life beginning at the age of fifty, and of $9.71 a [?]…
