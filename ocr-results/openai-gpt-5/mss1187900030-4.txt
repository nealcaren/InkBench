depar[?]ment but have not received an
answer yet. I expect one to-night. It has
been beautiful weather ever since you left
and I do feel that we will keep [?] [?]
[?] but it will be keen and sharp.
Elizabeth is making preparations to lead
the lecture next Monday night and [?]
[?] on [?] of next week.
I believe she has not made any ap-
pointments yet but I think [?]
[?] Lewis will attend to it. [?]
in a great deal of noise and confusion being
in the schoolroom and the few who have not
[?] their dinners are as full as [?]
as possible. I hope you will have as com-
fortable a time as possible and that you
will not return home sick. Old Brown
will have to keep out of sight for a little while
the Governor of Misso[?]ri has a reward of
$3,000 offered for his capture and he will
[?] give himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love,
And enclosed you will find a note
from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie
will send a few lines,

Your Affec. Daughter,
Rosetta Douglass
