Washington D.C.
July 15 - 1883.

Dear Grandpa,

I received
your affectionate letter on the
12th and we were very glad
to hear from you, and to know
that you are getting along
nicely!
Everything is passing along
smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times almost
intolerable. It is now
about nine o'clock and the
thermonitor stands about - 84 1/2.
Charlie has not left yet,
for the Eastern Shore; and
I doubt whether he will or
not; I think the latter as
I don't hear him say any-
