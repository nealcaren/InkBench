feel that I am growing old,
and not now what I have
been - although time has
been quite generous with
me - you will see by
this letter that it harder
for me to write now than
in old times when my
nerves was steady
and strong - give my
kind regards to your
wife in which my good Ruth
heartily joins - excuse this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend and wellwisher
James N. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see
us. I say Amen. you have
now an engagement not
