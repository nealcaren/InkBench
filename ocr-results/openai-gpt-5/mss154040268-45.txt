To the Speakers Bureau:
Those roses were sweet, beautiful, [?] dispelling, but
Roses sind Verboten.
Put your money behind the suit to vindicate my
character. Please donâ€™t disobey orders again.
I have a vile lumbago; growing worse every day which
shows what follies [?] [?] do for a woman
is a daily comfort; sometimes the [?] of
the Speakers Bureau!
