Dear Mrs Chapman Catt,

We put in our program of this year to read lectures or lessons for women. Mr Paul [Janulescu?] has filled it. He is in the L.D.F. and gives popular evening courses. But as there are no complete libraries in Roumania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible, as you see, to render the titles of the books, necessary [preparations/bibliographies?]. Readers therefore [we ask] to you and to the other sections of I.W.S.A. to bring you help.

Feeling so much the lack of a free library we [will] try, at one time with our studies, to found one at B[?] and perhaps then will we be able to assemble round it the women in a club, as we are dreaming of since a long time. Would your association be able for the generous act of help unto sisters and to send us one or the other standard works on women movement in your country and specially those, where we could find biographies of your famous women, [those] we could find biographies [of] your famous women.

He would speak in a first serie of lectures, on political and social placement of women; in a second [series] [about] the portraits of women in art and science. But he knows so little, it is to say not much [????].
