Alice Stone Blackwell

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to obtain a medical degree and another aunt was the first to be ordained a minister. Her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college; became a lecturer against Negro slavery and for woman’s rights when public speaking by women was considered an indecency; and throughout her life was one of the half-dozen great national figures in the woman’s movement. Her father gave a fortune to the service of the woman’s cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from childhood with the widely scattered activities through which Miss Blackwell has recorded in her book “Lucy Stone, Pioneer of Woman’s Rights.” Miss Blackwell served as corresponding secretary of the American Woman Suffrage Association for about twenty years; and President of the New England Woman Suffrage Association for about twenty years; and President of the New England and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Associations. As Josiah Blackwell’s chief weapon she often championed, her work of editing the Woman’s Journal and writing for that paper, as well as innumerable leaflets, articles, and “speakers” letters and pamphlets, made the Journal not only an organ of the cause but a vast reservoir of information, learning, and guidance. In the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom, in editor of outstanding ability. In the council chamber she supplied the rich wisdom of information, tolerance, and sound judgment; in the platform the trenchant wit, the steady indignation, fearless satire and courage quite equal to the struggle which was for many years a life-and-death contest up to the hour of victory.

The instant the ballot was won she took up the task of encouraging and organizing the new voters for public-spirited citizenship. She became Honorary Chairman and an active worker of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.

In line with her family’s pioneer interest in the cause of women’s education she has served Boston University, her alma mater, as a trustee since 1907.

Throughout her long life Miss Blackwell’s sensitive human sympathies have recognized no countries, but the whole family of nations. In the early years before and during the ‘90s, she became a lifelong champion of that people. Among her interests and services in this field she published, among other books, the moving translations into English which “Armenian Poems”; her devotion to Armenian was responsive and included the brilliant “verse of Avetik [?]” and her “Armenian Poems.”

The atrocious oppressions of the Czar’s government led her to active work with the American Friends of Russian Freedom. Her warm cooperation and friendship with Mme. Catherine Breshkovsky extended over many years and included the editing of her autobiography and letters.

In the struggles of labor, her cause equally enlisted her quick sympathies on countless occasions. Repeatedly she has given her ready and energetic aid to the support of the oppressed, the relief of the sick, the care of the poor and other civic services.

Her devotion to the cause of foreign peoples has brought into English through her translations serviceable and widely appreciated books, among them: “Armenian Poems,” “Songs of Grief and Gladness” (Yiddish), “Songs of Russia,” the Hungarian poems of “Petofi” and “Some Spanish-American Poets”; in the latter a number of poems from Portuguese as well as from Spanish-American poets. The interest she aroused in these works and the knowledge she opened to Americans of new peoples and new poets continues and still continues.

Within the last few months Miss Blackwell chosen last year to receive the annual award for outstanding public service in Massachusetts; now at seventy-seven she has not at any moment been withdrawn from the public view. Now at seventy-seven years of age she still lends her counsel in the movement for civic education; she gives generous work with the ready and thoughtful attention which has been her habit in the service of every great cause; and she does not falter in the response of heart and mind and hand toward any call to aid the quest of freedom wherever and in whatever form it calls to her for help.
