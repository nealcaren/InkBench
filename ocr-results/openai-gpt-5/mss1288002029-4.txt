"The Governor seems right," said Mrs. [?] [?] that, if [?] the [?] [?] and [?] of his intention to [?] [?] [?] he would be doing very well. I [?] [?] from which the Governor in his [?] [?] experience may prove to [?] [?] [?].

"How could he be wrong," replied Mrs. [?], "when he has tried to determine the whole question by the right of women to vote in the schools? There are now trials which are periodical. When are the visits to be made? In the evening or the morning? By helping them to get the franchise and by giving them a share in the government we will bring home to the women (as to the men) the duty of the franchise. I am living in a time when every woman is doing something to advance her cause, and the Governor is [?] [?] to help us."

"How do you view the Governor’s proposal for a popular vote on woman suffrage?" we asked.

"It is a wise measure," she replied, "for at present we [?] that half a loaf is better than no bread. I think that a majority of the people will be satisfied to choose a popular vote."

"And what would the effect be, do you think, of such a vote?"

"It would be to clear the way," she said. "It is not the end; it is the beginning of the end. It would show that the people in general wish to have the question settled, and settled in our favor."

THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR VOTE.

"You then think the majority of voters would be in favor of granting suffrage to women?"

"I should feel very certain about this," she answered; "but there are so many who are in good humor toward us in the abstract, but who would draw back in actual opposition. Further study would reveal many objections, social and political. I think we will vote to Governor’s plan of postponing the vote."

"Is postponement of voting for school and municipal elections a wise one?" we asked.

"For a time, postponement will give another chance for organization in our own behalf," she answered. "We must not be discouraged by a defeat. I have a warm hope we may secure our rights before very long, and meantime we can prepare for the future by organization and practical efforts."

"We should strive for municipal suffrage. We should always demand the franchise for schools. We need correct, reliable voters for school committees; we can do this very much better than we are doing it now."

"Then you are confident the school-board vote would help the interests of suffrage?"

"Yes, particularly for the increase of women, and particularly for the increase of those of our people who give their attention to the work of education in spite of what individuals may do or think."
