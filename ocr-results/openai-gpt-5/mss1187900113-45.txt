all this to acquire necessary experience & to be
learned by those I would add, that I fully know
their trouble & could not but make common cause
with them — If so it is but a blessing in disguise!

And now let me add that on Easter eve I
was sought by the Director of Home Institute
[Mr Jones?] to tell me he had
proof that Philanthropic money as he called it could
be found in the North (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for such needs — and had invited
to which he added the suggestions mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 7 Page 1 of the
Daily Inter-Ocean of Chicago [?] on account
of a successful colored colonization at [????] place
Alabama, to which I refer you — and send to interest
you. It is a number of 64 pages printed as
souvenir — I suppose its [?] anniversary which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair! When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you finally to
ask your opinion & counsel how best to proceed.
I feel more of your sympathy for the cause —
perhaps for auld lang syne? — in common, hopefully,
& with very best wishes of the season for your
enhanced prosperity, dear Sir
most truly yours
