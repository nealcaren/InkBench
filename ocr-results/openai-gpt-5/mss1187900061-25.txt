Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 25, 1883.

Honorable
[?][?]. Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass: I read your
speech delivered on the occasion
commemorative of Emancipation
in the District of Columbia
and was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterances,
and surprised at the vigor and
brilliancy of your new powers after
an almost constant experience of [?]
for nearly a half century
in the cause of our oppressed
people.
