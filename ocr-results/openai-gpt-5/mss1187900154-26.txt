Chicago, Ill., U.S.A.  June 18[?]

My dear Mr. Douglass:

I leave for the East early
tomorrow morning & now I have just [?]
[?] my calling on you & Mrs. Douglass that
I shall be unable to do so.  Do make my
excuses to your good wife for me.  I remember
her with so much pleasure in Paris.  I hope
you return to Chicago later in the summer.
Then I will not fail to see you both.  In
the meanwhile believe me,

Very truly yours,

Theodore Stanton,

26 West 61th St.,
