ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, a pioneer of woman’s rights. Her father, Henry B. Blackwell, was an abolitionist and practically the only man who really devoted his life to obtaining equal rights for women. One of Miss Blackwell’s aunts, Elizabeth Blackwell, was the first woman to take a medical degree, and another, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, was the first woman to be ordained a minister. Miss Blackwell was graduated from Boston University in 1881, and then followed her parents in working for suffrage and in publishing the Woman’s Journal, carrying the paper on alone after their death until 1917 when it became the Woman Citizen. For many years she appeared annually before the committee of the Massachusetts Legislature to answer the anti-suffrage arguments, and a distinguished lawyer once said he considered he had [?] the ablest presentation of controversial matter he had ever heard. It was also Miss Blackwell who brought together the two parties of the suffrage movement, when those estrangement [?], welding them in 1890 into the National American Woman Suffrage Association, of which she served as secretary for many years. For years she has been a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Close to her heart is the cause of the Armenians, and she has translated into English a volume of Armenian poems, as well as one of Russian. She was also the literary editor of the biography of Catherine Breshkovsky, “The Little Grandmother,” which was at one time one of the “six best sellers.”
