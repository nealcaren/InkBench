Life and escape from bondage
for me to sell, saying, if I sold
them I should have one volume
to keep for my reward I think
I sold ten volumes, They were
published by Joseph Barker
of Leeds Yorkshire, I kept my
book untill 1857 and some
one stole it and never have I
seen one like it since

The remembrance of all the
above notes prompts me to
solicit you and your wife to
a trial visit. I have been
searching for days to find out
your abiding home and failed
correctly to get it untill yesterday,
And now a line from you will
give me pleasure to say Where,
and at what time you can
recieve a call from me on yourself
and wife (whom I have not met)
our home are not far apart, Salem, Ohi.

Do you Remember Benjamin [?] & wife
old anti slavery friends. They had an under
ground daughter she married John Lewis.
My brother's daughter is married to her[?]
at Salem Ohio. The [?] are on Exhibit
at Manufacturers Hall. My husband has been
ill and have not yet got to the Fair. [?]
through the glass or Electrical display
October awaiting your early answer. With best
wishes Truly yours, Henrietta Harris
