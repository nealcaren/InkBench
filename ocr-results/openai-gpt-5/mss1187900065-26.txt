Hon: Frederick Douglass,

Dear Sir:

I yesterday deposited with the Surrogate, Hudson
Co. New Jersey, the Will of the late Ottilie Assing, along
with a letter from me declining to serve as Executor,
copy of which I forward to you with this,

You will please take such action in
the matter of supplying a substitute, as you deem proper,
and believe me â€”

Yours, with great respect

Henry Bergh
