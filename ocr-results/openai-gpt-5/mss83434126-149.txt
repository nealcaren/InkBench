in the rear for the purpose to capture the wagon trains.
The Federals were commanded by Genls Curtis & Sigel, the battle
was fought for three days without any decisive result, but on the
8th Genl Curtis made additional charges, and at half past ten
he advanced the whole along his whole line, when the rebels were in-
stantly thrown into confusion and fled precipitately, on all the
attack. The division of Gen. Dorn attacked in our centre,
that of Price escaped by another — the pursuit was contin-
ued by Genl Sigel toward R[????]ville, and by the Cavalry to
the mountains, the rout of the enemy was complete; of the
3000 killed and wounded were left upon the field; among the whole
dead were found Genl McCulloch, a peculiar feature in
this battle was the presence of several thousand Indians under
the command of Albt. Pike; their savage instincts were de-
monstrated after battle, the federal dead and wounded were
found to be scalped, thus turning this [????] [?] sanguinary slaughter,
Union loss 300 killed, and 900 wounded.
