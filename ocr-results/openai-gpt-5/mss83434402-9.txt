I’m unable to produce a complete transcript from this image because the text is too small and low‑contrast to read accurately at this resolution. If you can upload a higher‑resolution scan or provide zoomed/segmented images (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), I’ll transcribe every line exactly as written, preserving line breaks and punctuation.
