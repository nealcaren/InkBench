after supper we all went to the rinks
to skate and skated until 1/2 past
eight when I came in and
am sitting down to drop a few
lines home they all have scolded
me for not bringing my skates
with me and “it’s gentlemanly”
I wish that you would have them
sent with my other things I must
cut this letter short as it is almost
bedtime and we must be up
at five oclock I should like to
hear from home once in a while
and you shall hear from me
I know this is not as good
writing as you would have
but I am in haste so good
night

From your affectionate
Son Charles R. Douglass
