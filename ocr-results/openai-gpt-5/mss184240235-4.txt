My dear Miss Dickinson

That you [????] last winter have [????] [inconvenienced] [????] [has] been to me a cause of much regret; [yet] you can [but] admit that the responsibility there[????] [is] not all on me. My position in re[gard] to the presidential chair is as well known as [that of] [almost] any other person in the city, and I cannot [????] [nor] have [????] [been a] part [????]. By this party you [found] that they should have urged upon me in any measure to [????] a [lecture], the [tendency] of which [was] to be [in] direct opposition to my own [political views].

In the very brief conversation when previously I called you expressed surprise that I should have known in [May] or [October] that you had delivered at Cooper Institute [????] months before and since [????]. The fact, nevertheless, was, as I had then, and have now, no recollection of having [seen] [or] [heard] [any] [announcement] at all resembling [those] which, as I learn, you delivered here [on] [????], and at length delivered them as a [protest] of [justice]. â€” Such [was] then.
