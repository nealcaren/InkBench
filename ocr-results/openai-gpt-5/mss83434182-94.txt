I’m sorry, but the text in the table is too small to read accurately from this image. I can see the footer “BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA.” and the page number “89,” but I can’t reliably transcribe the names and entries in the table without introducing errors.

If you can provide a higher‑resolution or zoomed/rotated image (or crop the page into sections), I’ll transcribe the full page for you.
