Jean fed us [?]s all [?] the
[?] W. Vols and I dodged around
among them and along [?]
night bought a blue dress and
received a caller,
I’m hoping the war will end
in the South East and that the Greeks
in their white petty coats will chase the
Nazi’s home where at least one
will commit suicide.
When we meet again some [?]
one be as clean as you are.
Even Mary Wood[?] [?] you will
be “a shining woman”

Looking forward
Carrie C. Catt
