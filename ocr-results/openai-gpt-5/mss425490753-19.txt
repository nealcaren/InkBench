FUNDAMENTALLY BUSINESS IS GOOD

Building
the Builders
of Chicago

J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year), Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), rally to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked beans go with Cornelius—Barbara says the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy goes hard for the soup and a big cut of that spicy mince pie.

You are building a better Chicago—we are building better Chicagoans.

RUTH McCORMICK,
DENEEN SOUND
CAMPAIGN CRIES

Senator Attacks County
Administration.

BY PARKE BROWN.

Both United States Senator [Charles S.] Deneen and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, [who has announced that she will seek the Republican nomination for the United States senate,] last night [sounded] the campaign cries [with which they will appeal to the voters of Illinois].  [They addressed a meeting] at the [Hotel ?] before more than [?] persons.

[Mrs. McCormick declared that] the issue of the coming campaign [will be] whether Illinois shall be governed by the will of the people or by [a political machine].  [She attacked] the present [county] administration.  Senator Deneen [assailed] the practices of [machine] politics and [pledged] a program of honest and efficient government.

[He declared that] the people of Illinois are tired of [waste and extravagance] and [demand] economy and [good] government.  [He praised] the record of the state [in former years] and said that the Republican party [must] restore that record.  [He criticized] the [present] administration for [high taxes] and [incompetence].

[Blames Cook County Rule.]

Since the election of 1927, [he continued], Chicago and Cook county [have suffered] from [a domination] which [has permitted] wasteful [spending] and [inefficiency].  [He charged] that appointments have been made for political reasons and not for public service.  [He urged] the people of the state to [repudiate] this rule and [return] to [clean] government.

Penalty of Bankruptcy.

[The] relationship in this county [between] politics and public business [was condemned].  [He warned] that continued [mismanagement] would bring the penalty of bankruptcy upon the city and county.  [He advocated] strict economy, [full] value for public expenditures, and [honest] administration.

Senator Condemns Patronage.

[The senator declared that] political patronage [has permitted] incompetent persons to hold office and [has driven] capable men from [public] service.  [He announced] that he would [support] a reform program, [including] the merit system, [a balanced] budget, and [reduction of taxes].

Mrs. McCormick Offers Program.

Mrs. McCormick, just returned from Washington, [outlined] her program for the senate campaign.  [She promised] to fight for [economy in government], [honest] elections, and [an end to political domination].  [She asserted] that the [interests] of the people must come before [those of any organization].  [She urged] Republicans to unite to [win] in 1930.

[Association on April 5.]

[Resolutions were adopted ?].  W. A. Rowe, vice chairman of the Republican [county] committee, and G. P. Medina, [spoke].  [The county committee will be called into session next Friday afternoon.]  [Further details illegible.]
