I wonder if
you knew
Dr. Lewi[?]...?

MEMORIAL SET UP
TO DR. EMILY LEVI[?]

Friends of the late Dr. Emily Levi[?]
presented a check for $14,000
yesterday to the trustees of the
New York Infirmary to start an
endowment fund in her memory.
Income will be used for the care of
ailing women physicians connected
with the infirmary and [????].

The check was presented to Mrs.
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of
the board; [Marion Manner?][?], medical director of
the infirmary; at the trustees’ meeting
[????] Avenue [????].

Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Levi[?]:
“She was one of the older doctors
who shared the courage of their con-
victions and the sacrifices that con-
victions bring. They carry a sense
of honor and of obligation to their
doctor. Without her we [????]
[????] long since have [????].”

Dr. Levi[?], who died two years
ago, was for decades a member of
the Infirmary’s staff. From her own
means and from funds entrusted to
her by her friends she aided the
work of the Infirmary and estab-
lished one of the pioneer endow-
ments for a clinic of women physi-
cians.

The name of the projected new
infirmary building will be known
as the Emily S. Levi[?] Memorial,
when the funds are raised and the
endowment will support it.


My tonsils escaped the adventure for the
old incision[?] absc[?] to[?] — not possi-
bly — shot down — not open — indoors, crowded
the heat and all — and we’re all in
no service with ices[?] — A letter of [thanking?]
of grievances was today; the men had to
shut down the electric[?] completely —
we’ve lived for more than
two weeks awaiting the completion of
the [????].  The work is nearly done but
because of that work it is hardly
possible to get the house straight; it’s dirty,
dusty, and everything upset.  Everybody
is very good — the electric fan
now keeps me alive — though the heat
is oppressive.  The sleep that should
refresh me is broken by the
noises of the street — and of the
building — and there’s little air
for my room.  The least breath
makes me grateful — but it
isn’t enough — and now the
[????] of the summer.
