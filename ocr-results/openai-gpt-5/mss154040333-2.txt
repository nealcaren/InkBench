Dear Mrs Chapman Catt.

I just finished the superb book
on the great work you have
accomplished during your
wonderfully active life!

This book is a grand inspiration
for all of us in every country

I was deeply moved by the pages
on your international work and
the meetings in Geneva, few of
which I was fortunate enough
