I’m happy to transcribe this page, but most of the rows are too small/unclear to read accurately (especially the names and the “Sec.” and “Grave” numbers). If you can provide a higher‑resolution image or a zoomed-in crop, I can supply a complete, line-by-line transcript.

Here is what I can read with confidence:

Page header: 104  UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN
Side header: BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA—Continued

Column headings (left to right):
- No.
- Name.
- Rank.
- Co.
- Regiment.
- Date of death.
- Sec.
- Grave.
- Remarks.

Most entries on this page list soldiers with surnames beginning with “R” and regiments from various states (examples visible include New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maine). Dates of death appear blank (dotted), and the rightmost “Sec.” and “Grave” columns contain numbers I can’t reliably read at this resolution.

If you can resend a clearer image (or close-ups of the table in two or three sections), I’ll provide a complete, exact transcript.
