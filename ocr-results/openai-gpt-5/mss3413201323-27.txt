I’m sorry, but the resolution of this image is too low for me to read most of the text accurately. I can make out the page header and the main headline:

- THE REGISTER AND LEADER: WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 24, 1916.
- When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage
- The Des Moines Register (page 6)

However, the body text in all columns is too small/blurred to transcribe without guessing, which would violate the “type exactly what you see” rule.

If you can provide a higher‑resolution scan or close‑ups of each column (or even split the page into several cropped images), I’ll produce a complete, line‑by‑line transcript.
