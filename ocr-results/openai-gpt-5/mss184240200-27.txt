I know a good speech when  
I hear it!!! I shan’t take  
his opinion when I’m absent,  
surely I prefer mine when I  
have the same chance to judge  
as he -  

I don’t know why you  
wanted to see that scrap  
of a letter from my western  
friend but I inclose a  
copy -  

Good bye  
again  
with heartiest  
wishes for your health  
specially if you think of  
facing the vigor of a  
New England summer next  
July -
