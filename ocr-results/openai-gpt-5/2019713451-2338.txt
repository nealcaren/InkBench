Give Special Heed to these Directions.

This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions here given take for granted that those on the cover of No. 1 have been studied and followed. In this No., the letters formed from the first four principles are reviewed, and the stem letters, l, b, d, f, g, q, are introduced.

The Contractions used are as follows: — m. l., Main Line; l. c., Connecting Line; m. s., Main Line Slope; c. s., Connecting Line Slope; m., Modified; pl., Parallel; p., Principle; l., Element, etc.

The Diagram on the cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths. The Diagram above the copy, the part made at each count, the principles, the direction and flow, etc., is to be placed in the lines.

SUGGESTIONS. 1. The only possible way of teaching Penmanship successfully in a school, is to have all the scholars do the same line in the same box at the same time.

2. The order of instruction is KNOWLEDGE, EXECUTION, CRITICISM.

First, KNOWLEDGE. Explain the copy carefully, and have it analyzed into its Principles, and into its Elements. Teach the nature, peculiarity, scope, beginning and ending of each element; notice the connections, change of angle and relations; and show the difference between the letters; call attention to similarities and parallel parts and lines.

Second, EXECUTION. Let them find the copy with their pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing the pupils to be very careful as to position, holding pen, rests, and movements, which are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do

not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should be high enough from the desk to allow a holder to be passed under the right side.

Third, CRITICISM. Criticize the line, writing, and explanations on each particular given as knowledge, which the class answers by raising their hands. The errors lie, of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is a curve, it may be curved the wrong way, or too much or too little; if sloped, then too much or too little; if the line is too short or too long; too broad, or too narrow. Select one or two of the most prevalent faults discovered by the answers and by your own observation of errors, and direct special attention to them, and have one more line written that they may be corrected. Then criticize these same faults until all have succeeded in correcting them. The effect will be a decided improvement in the execution of each. And direct attention to the correction of all faults until the whole is perfect.

GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end on the base line. 2. Every principle touches both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines; and the sides of the oval written downward; [?] 4. The Connecting Lines are the minute lines written upwards. The Turns unite main to connecting lines. Sometimes the turns are written upward. The line formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into one another at the middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 5. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes; the even, for the down. 6. There are six Principles in the small letters; from these, with connecting and turning lines, all the letters are made. 7. The red lines mark the columns, each of which is divided into three oblique lines or boxes. Write down the columns always. 8. The m. s. is 50° from base line.

N. B. Teachers will find our Manual of Penmanship a complete compendium of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tablets are invaluable for presenting the Elements, Principles and Capitals, of large size and in perfect form. The Oblique Lines are a great help to the scholar in acquiring correct slope.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES.

COPY 1. KNOWLEDGE. The 1’s and 2’s are pl., respectively. The top of 1 is a little more than half across the box. Mind the slope of 2, and the distance between the oblique lines. Analyze [?]. Notice the oval is perfectly straight. The stem touches the top and bottom of the first 2; the oval the second 2. Call attention to the [?] side of forms, the left side of the turn, and to the second principle [?] slants up and to the left; thus [?] the round form of the turn as well as making a broad turn by going too soon on the [?], or sagging down on the right side.

COPY 2. EXECUTION. Write two or three lines of ovals, using each count, giving special attention to Position, Penholding, Rests, and Movements. Next, have one column-line written by the second. Thus, “1, 2,” “1, 2,” (“which” means place the pen, not on the move) by the count from 1, 2; “2,” “2,” “2,” etc. [?]
