wider public of readers, - hope
that it will have the putting
of keeping the Negroes of the North
from deserting the Republican
party, - a twisold step it was
to be for them, as your strong and
unanswerable arguments clearly
show. These arguments, coming from
you, must have great weight to win
the colored people who are the
ones you specially want to influence. So though relieved
from office you are working out
with all your old power. I
hope that you are labouring upon
the work in good health, - that
you will not even weary by
travelling or lecturing will become
curses again. When you last
wrote you were in some city

about one of you sons, who was ill
- I hope that he has long recover
- that all your family are well.
I hoped that the book of Carpenters
letters writing, which was reprints
Prof. Wellin Carpenter of Oxford is
doing, would have been not too
distant, but it will be busy

entitled "Personal & Social Civic
Ethics" as is prepared by a short
memoir of his P.T.C.
I now for a few weeks to my sister
On Blachs. - I found it hard to
leave home, - but my friend
where I am now & Illinois
write we to- & I have
now been about six weeks writing
