My dear Clara:

That book is one I mentioned to Rosa. I told her I thought the title was "Her Secret". I did not know that was the title at all. It was a book I once loaned me on a steamer about ten years ago. I do not remember the author or the publisher and never owned the book. You had better tell her to go to.

Everything out here is dried up forever. This is nice weather for City folks, but quite terrible on farmers. It has been hotter than -anana-

I think Mary Gray Peck is coming to spend Sunday, August 26th. When I get her answer, I will let you know, for we are expecting you to pay us a visit at the same time.

Thanks for the information about the coupons.
etc.

Lovingly yours,
[Signed] Carrie Chapman Catt
President.
