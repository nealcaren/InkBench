Captain Instructress and some Division craft paper
describing the two varieties. She didn't get any thing
My little & Chin Care. I surely definitely sealed they
could have the instructions at $3 per 100 just why
any one in the office should list them crept paper
is a mystery. I know they consist mostly of paper design
the campaign consists. That Rochester did not get the head-
quarters decrees for May 2, and the Captain
gathered for my Conference cannot take the
decorations home with them that is a long
way for my efficiency. Please see what is
the matter and who doesn't them crept
the paper. I could scarcely believe her.
