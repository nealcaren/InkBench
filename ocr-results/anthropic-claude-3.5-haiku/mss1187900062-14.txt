they might rather athwart the sympathies
of New York pointing in the North.
Who oppose the slavish & the criminal status
prohibition of legal extenuation of
the style now carried. The extension of
the ballot to the growing human
these are secure. If the colored
leaders denounce any policy for
not able furnishing by laws the
constitutional duty of spent execution
of the Colored people from particular
party of protest & prosper city.
will look rather childish. If
will tend to show that the colored
people can't move for the spread
thin for the substance of citizenship.
