I'll transcribe the visible text for each image:

Left Image Caption:
No. 51. Monkey Temple. Two hundred cows live
here and look at you in the pictures. Only one of
the cows is in the picture. They get out from the under
the pillars and walk about as if they own the place.

Right Image Caption:
The bodies that of the men on shore of
Calcutta. The body on the stone is lying just in the
light, some of the river shore in background. About 150
bodies were washed up on the shore at one time by the
river after a flood, epidemic, and overflowing of the banks
like the river.
