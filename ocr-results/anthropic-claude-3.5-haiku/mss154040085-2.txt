Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Chairman
Woman's Centennial Congress
120 Paine Avenue
New Rochelle, N.Y.

Dear Mrs. Catt:

I wish to express to you my appreciation of the commemorative gift of a copy of the book "Victory- How Women Won It".

The photostate of the account of the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848, as well as other reprints were found to be very interesting. I was sorry not to receive a copy of the Tuesday evening program containing the list of women in careers.

From all reports I hear about the Congress, I am sure it was interesting and stimulating, as well as inspirational to everyone present. Personally I am very much interested in vocations for women, and am a member of the local Chicago Club of Altruus International. Our Club has made efforts to carry out the International Altrusan program of giving vocational information to young girls who are choosing vocations, as well as to assist women who have found it necessary to make vocational adjustments later in life.

You can see, therefore, I am sure that our entire club membership was very much interested in following your program in the meetings of your Congress, and were just as happy as I was to have been selected as one of the representative women for your special meeting.

Very truly yours,

Millie E. Kaleem
