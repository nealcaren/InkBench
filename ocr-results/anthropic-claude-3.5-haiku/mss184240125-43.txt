I came to Boston in Nov. to
make a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now trying for winter
to be gone. I have been very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not hearten, else
not break easily. I thought I should
see you there this spring, because Mr. Pierpont
said so. It has been a trying winter,
but spring & violets are now the near.
Agile writes me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work will do itself.

But if she is shut in, she so hates
in-door "duties". But she feels, the hernia
chafes. She has a good-practical man, &
keeps her from doing unheard of things. Taint
easy. God bless you dear - always.

Lovingly - Manna dear -
