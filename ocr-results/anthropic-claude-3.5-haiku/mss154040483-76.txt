Whose Government is This?
By Carrie Chapman Catt

THE question for our consideration is whether the department of Election Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it a part of the work of the League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less operating to many women, but for that very reason it is more necessary for women voters to comprehend its need.

If any other department of the League should be dropped, for example, Women in Industry, Social Hygiene, Child Welfare, other organizations would be strong enough to carry on the work done, as they were before these departments were adopted by the League of Women Voters; but if the political department be dropped there is no other body of women to take it up.

We were enfranchised in 1920. We ought to have been entrenched twenty years earlier at least, and that is not mere talk. The reason why we were not enfranchised long before some of you were old enough to take an interest in public questions was that government by the people rarely functions - many causes why it does not function may be traced to Election Laws and Methods.

Controlling Groups

A small group of people determined to oppose promised legislation, if provided with money, are were the hindrances, and delays. They would hold back legislation and prevent action through the masses of the people demand it. Such groups of people may make control of public works and utilities legislation, and in return secure promises of no action in legislatures or Congress, provided that party is elected to power.

It may secure the orders of that party, all the way down the line to the most remote rural election district chairman, to defeat a referendum.

Why were the railroads fighting ratification in Tennessee? Why did the Manufacturers' Association there work against it? A Republican in New York who wanted to support both the League of Nations and dry enforcement had to choose which he wanted the more, for he could not do both and vote one ticket.

Surely it is possible to reform these laws and methods so the people can vote more directly, and also to make representation more truly representative. So the League of Women Voters asks that this department of Election Laws and Methods be continued as an expression of the failure of our governmental machinery to register the people's wishes that it has been repeatedly asked for by our readers.

Here is the address made by Mrs. Catt at the Cleveland Convention of the League of Women Voters when, at her suggestion, the Committee on Election Laws and Methods was elevated to a department of work called Efficiency in Government. This speech was felt to be so fine an expression of the failure of our governmental machinery to register the people's wishes that it has been repeated several times at the request of readers.

Here is what she said when necessity arose. The combination of these lobbies against suffrage has happened over and over again. Presumably the program was that of the labor interests, but many other interests united in its support.

There is also the autocracy of what is known as the boss system to be watched. In one of the state which had not ratified there was absolute by a political boss what could only, frankly, be said that they would not vote for ratification nor yet let any one know what they would do until they had had their orders from their main. This has wanted to retire from politics and re-fused to give orders because he said if he did so these men would expect in return various political favors which would cost him a good deal of money and would prevent his retirement from politics as soon as he desired.

A system in this country for taking the vote of electors has been worked out. It has been from decade to decade much improved, but there are pitfalls for honest voters in almost every department and before the business of taking the people's vote is a perfectly conducted one there must be a veritable revolution in the methods of voting, getting the nominations, making the platforms, and securing the legislative action.

For example, in the recent presidential election voters found it impossible to support the parties they approved by voting any one ticket. A Republican in New Jersey who wanted to support both the League of Nations and dry enforcement had to choose which he wanted the more, for he could not do both and vote one ticket.

These were two questions only in that campaign and there were many others. So difficult was it for women to register the opinions they wanted to express in that election that very many of them felt the vote would never be any value to them. What happened in that time, because of the method of them, happened between the state and the federal election political machines and bosses do so much political juggling over issues.

Reform, therefore, is needed all along the line. It is needed in the election of the President of the United States and all the way down to the dog-catcher in the smallest village.

Where We Need Reform

Perhaps we need it most in our platform making. Ours is a country governed by parties. Parties are of tremendous power in this land, so tremendous that they can give the order whether a referendum submitted by the legislature shall be carried or rejected, and obedient electors walk up to the polls and vote as they are told. Platforms are made and are supported by parties and party tickets and few voters have little or nothing to say about issues to be included. Party loyalty is relied upon to carry the ticket pledged to the platforms and party loyalty usually successfully accomplishes the aim as to the managers.

Progress is being made toward reform; every decade witnesses improvement, but we are traveling forward too slowly. If ours is to be the great leading nation among the world's nations, some of us must be more earnest to the method of the platform.

There are three main reasons for this proposed change:

First. We were a political body when we were working for the suffrage and we secured the vote by political action.
