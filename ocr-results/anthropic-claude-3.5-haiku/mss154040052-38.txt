John continued giving concerts as long as there were any broken-in-law, sister-in-law or neighbors to sing all kinds of songs, mostly old. He sang "The Yankee Boy."

All these things have been lightly causing to me. That has become of them all I do not know, but one brother lost his wife and five children and then died himself. Perhaps he says he will never get in that way. They certainly were a great family, and would entertain.

I hope you are well and enjoying life.

Lovingly,

My dear Miss Blackwell:

I am sorry to trouble you again about that annuity. There is something more to explain about the annuity. The annuity has gone through and yet there remains something to me.

I enclose a paper which they ask both you and me to sign. You must have a witness, but not a notary, so any one will do.

I should call the Insurance Company to send the checks to me and tell them do to it, but all insurance companies have to be authorized by the state to endorse the annuity. In other words, they are not realizing the money; therefore, when two people are the beneficiaries of an annuity, both must together otherwise agreed. Every check, therefore, would back to me for over to the person for your endorsement and not having all receipt, hence the necessity for getting all deposit.

The annuity has gone through and I have the policy. I deposited with the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, $3,500 and received $146.56 per year.

The total income from the $4,500.00 is $146.56 per year. It is my intention to divide that equally with you. You will, therefore, get $73.28 each year for your life. In a sensible way to make the division would be this.

I will make out September 15, 1926 and will forward a check for $73.28 to make on that full check to you. The second check will come on March 18, 1926 and I will keep that one. The third will come on June 18, 1926 and I will send it to you. If you die before that time in other words, I will withdraw the amount standing to your credit and alternate check one.

If I go first, and I fully pass, you will get the interest for your life. If you go first, I will get it all. That seems a fair way.

I shall notify the Committee of this arrangement and they will enter it as they please. You remember September 15, 1925, the interest on your $175.00 will be $9.75 in September, but you get $750.00, but you prefer, I think, you need not bother yourself with this.
