Journal Friend,

There is to be a suffrage festival Nov 14th and 15th and we are to have a woman's Journal booth. Can you and we any decoration and a large card to have some "movie" page - and to have about 50 subscription blanks.

I'm never done anything of this sort and have little idea how to go about it.

But Dr. MacNaughton who is getting up the festival telephoned this morning that Alice Paul had sent her word she would not pay the cost of creating a booth for the Suffragist and Dr. May R. said that if she. Dr. Mac M. had to pay the cost of creating the booth she would off it be used for the journal the paper she preferred to help. I promised to see to it.
