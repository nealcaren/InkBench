My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to congratulate the world upon having you in all these eighty years to inspire and humanity to do its best to advance freedom and civilization.

You have been a recognised thinker and leader to many fields where men and women are proud to follow. My only regret is that the United States has not yet had the courage to elect a woman to the office of president. You have been my candidate for that place for many years. How proudly we should all have campaigned for you!

It is impossible to express adequately our appreciation of all you have done for men and women of the whole world.

It has been a great privilege and joy to work in the ranks with you so wisely at the head.

We all in this household wish you a very Happy Birthday with deep gratitude and congratulations.

Affectionately,

Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
120 Paine Ave.,
New Rochelle, New York.

My dear Mrs.Johnson,

A social-delivery letter from Mrs.Stantial, just received, requests that I write you some answer to, and some questions that she has asked so that you will relieve this letter before your meeting on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place at present, in which to place a collection such as that I have suggested. We cannot find a place and maintenance. Because it could not guarantee the things to my own library, and in fact of the National Suffrage Association I have arranged to place this in the Congressional Library and have kept intact for an inventory the papers which I found there twenty-five years. Very many years ago the utility of the paper and ink, but there will remain a valuable collection showing the source of the Suffrage-movement.

The Congressional Library has accepted this place and is ready for it as soon as I can send it to them. They are just completing a large addition to their building. I can see no reasons why our collection cannot be sent there as an addition to the collection that now goes to Washington.

The Congressional Library is only interested in books, but at the same time there are already three very interesting sort of small collections here representing the National American Woman Suffrage Association.

I have written Alice Stone Blackwell that we have no record of Lucy Stone there and that it is very important that she should be included, in place, at once. Interested in blogging, I have some momentos which I will add to the library there, perhaps just copies of these things from the personal collection of the leaders and of suffrage-activities who will give this history.

If possible, I think these will help the collection of the suffrage-movement in place complete. I think of giving to the three books. They are tentative but have much importance to the National Suffrage Party archives and if the Archives survive I shall be willing that these perhaps be complete.

Mrs. Hill Irwin, who writes a book a year, was paid for writing a history of the Womans Party and her inaccurate book, I am unable at this time, so highly inaccurate that I tremble at some places. Both seem to be very inaccurate. I do not write of the project of my thing here. I can make the Archives a representative part of the Militant Suffrage history and it will represent it well.

I am not opposed to the Archives and here given a small sum of money to in part pay little confidential matters in them. This letter is confidential and comes hastily.

Carrie G. Catt
