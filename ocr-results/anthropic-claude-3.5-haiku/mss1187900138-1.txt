Hon. Fred. Scofield,
Dear Sir,

Francis M. Addington of Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age, under the following offering for the Lincoln Monument near inauguration "Father Abraham's Monument!"

This monument would seem to say,
That Lincoln's dead, but not so.
In vain the assassin arm to slay,
In vain his blood was made to flow.
In vain the will attempt to kill
In all our hearts he lives still.
And while a drop of patriot blood
Shall flow in any human frame
There thrill at memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln's name.

This monument we raise to thee
Great Chief whose Mandate Made us free
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
For thee, our true and constant friend.

Also the following
"A dirge to America Personified"
The world is gazing on thee.
Dispose thy robes with care
And with thy precious jewels
A down thy golden hair.

"Over"

Note: The document appears to be a handwritten tribute to Abraham Lincoln, written by Francis M. Addington at 86 years old, as part of an offering for the Lincoln Monument.
