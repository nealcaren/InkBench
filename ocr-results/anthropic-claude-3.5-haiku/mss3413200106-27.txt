Dear Miss Blackwell,â€”

I am blessed with a
propensity to be always at something. You
are something; still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three successive
efforts might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do.

The truth is, its hot, hot beyond
curse, to say nothing of dull. What resource else
was left but you. The other evening, so I so was
spoken of to me as having done this and that
as nurse in the war, I was called on to admire
her. I had to say, yes, I admire what she did.
But must she take to a little woman to do
so much. Then I said it my will for we
of you and she & me, to some good. No the
only recommendation I can have, practically
of York to me as she "was ordered not to
recommend him." Mercy where methinks
not how much he has done & can do, but how
much he is.

I suppose I was talking Guck,
& went no further, but you who understand
Guck, is this really so persistently dull
