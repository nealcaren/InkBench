IN THE LAND O' COTTON
President Warmly Received
in Georgia Today.
VISITED MOTHER'S HOME

ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROSWELL AND ATLANTA.

Many Tender Recollections of His
Early Childhood Awakened by
Visit to the Old Homestead.

ROSWELL, Ga., October 20.â€”President Roosevelt today carried out his long-cherished plan of visiting the home of his mother-in-law. One of the readiest

moments of the day was when he drove to the old homestead where his mother used to live and which he left with a happy recollection. Just as the carriage drew away from the old Bulloch homestead, where his mother lived and married, there was a moment's pause.

By request this newspaper extract is a partial transcript showing the newspaper article about President Roosevelt's visit to Georgia, focusing on his visit to his mother's childhood home. The text appears to be from The Evening Star newspaper, dated October 20th, and details his warm reception in Georgia, including addresses delivered in Roswell and Atlanta, and his emotional visit to his mother-in-law's old homestead.

Would you like me to provide the full transcription of the visible text?
