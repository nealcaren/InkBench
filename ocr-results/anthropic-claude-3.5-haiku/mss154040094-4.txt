I think that is quite un-
usual for a seventeen year
old boy. So if you could draw
it to some early day. I would
be very happy indeed.

Please remember me to Miss
Wilson & Miss Peck and be
sure to let me know if they
or you come to Washington.

With affectionate greetings

Gratefully yours,
Florence H. Darby
