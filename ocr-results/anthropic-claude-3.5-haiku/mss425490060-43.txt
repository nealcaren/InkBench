licoughe and may very
near de ath when a visitor
to him, Dpr Biggs now of
our dentist there said
he could cure him, and
put one drop of
turpentine so his marvel,
The he coughe stopped
and he is up and about
to-day- The doctor had
tried every thing without
avail, and act this can-
not possibly harm him
I thought you might try
it for your husband!
He have too few men
of the caliber of Judge
Terrell, to lose them if
any thing can be dons to
save them- and I trust
by the time this reaches
you, you will not need
this or any other remedy
that your husband will
be still on the road to
recovery.
