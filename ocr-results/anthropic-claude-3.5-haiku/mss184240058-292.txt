Perhaps somewhat fragmentary due to image quality, here's the best transcription:

Thou, just is Thou active state, & 
requires ending now.

[Several words are difficult to discern clearly due to the handwriting and image quality]

Microscin Clowles
delightfully full, &
clean, & green, & rolling,

I begin & feel Dotan
at once.

I will write up
dun tides unguetud[?] manner
after here & wrote look to
able other turns & I kind
tha' hip habits.

A turn more than ages to
& my morning & sales, written
when here next little class, at arena

Note: Some words are uncertain due to the handwriting's complexity and the image's condition. I've transcribed as accurately as possible while noting potential uncertainties.
