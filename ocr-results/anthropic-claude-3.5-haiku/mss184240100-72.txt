I apologize, but the handwritten text in this image is extremely difficult to read due to the dense, cross-written script and faded ink. The writing appears to cover both pages of the letter, with text written vertically across the horizontal text, making a complete accurate transcription nearly impossible without specialized restoration or advanced image processing. 

While I can make out fragments and individual words, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire document without risking significant errors. A professional historian or archivist with expertise in reading historical manuscripts would be best suited to provide a full transcription.

Would you like me to attempt to transcribe the few legible words I can clearly discern, or would you prefer I acknowledge the limitations in reading this particular document?
