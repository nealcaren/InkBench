AMSTERDAM, Dec. 16. -
The percentage of illegitimate
births in Germany has steadily
increased since the war, accord-
ing to an official statement in
the Prussian House of Repre-
sentatives. The report shows
that the percentage has grown
from 6.3 before the war to 10
per cent in 1926. A govern-
ment official explained the fig-
ures of illegitimate births be-
tween married and unmarried
women as a "social problem."
