The page is a table titled "UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN" (with the rest of the title cut off) numbered page 118. The table has the following column headers: No., Name, Rank, Co., Regiment, Date of death, Size of Grave, and Remarks.

The table appears to be only partially visible, with the first few entries of a list of Union soldiers' names and details. Some visible names include:

Suel C. Davidson
Sandy Green
Smith Wing
Winne Wetmore
Andrew Young

However, due to the image resolution and the table's format, I cannot confidently transcribe all the details for each entry. Most of the columns are partially obscured or cut off.

The table seems to be part of a larger document or book cataloging Union soldiers, likely from the American Civil War period, and their burial information.
