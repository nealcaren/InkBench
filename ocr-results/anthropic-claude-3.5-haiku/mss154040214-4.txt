Miss Rose Manns,

Amsterdam-Zuid,
Holland.

My dear Rose:

I have done a great deal of thinking about Marseilles. As Ashby said if I ever intended to cross the ocean again, this was the time to do it. As a matter of fact, had about made up my mind never to cross that ocean again, yet, after receiving her letter, I thought hard upon the subject. I finally concluded that there really was no particular help that I could give.

I am not so familiar with the Alliances now. I do not know the women who are the workers. My generation, like Annie Furuhjelm, are putting our younger shoulders to good-going work.

The great question is what to do with the Alliances. If I could go over with a pocket full of money for you all, I think you would be glad to see me. Everybody has lost money and income, is poor here at present. Everybody has not yet they do not bring in much, because another people have so little that can be taxed. The result for Europe. Now we are getting it "full made much trouble for Europe. Now we are getting it full." The United States in making such a little pleasing the general situation have had so little effect upon it. I simply grow worse and worse.

At present, I can see no prospect in any direction of receiving money here for the Alliances. Those are all struggling hard to get money for their own budgets which have been much cut down.

Looking back over the history of the Alliances, it would seem that Great Britain and the United States have furnished the major quantity of the money the Alliances has cost. Now these two sources are, more or less, out off, and no other country known to me is likely to come forward and take their place.

I have written to Mrs. Ashby and I enclose a copy of the letter which repeats much that I have said to you. Those ideas must be good ones. If that is so, it is because I do not know the situation well.

You must not think of me as a person who can run

any more, so if I should go to Marseilles, Aida Wilson must go with me and I would have to hurry back.

This year I want to Washington, as usual, but I came down with a cold and was in bed most of the time that we were there. I went to bed again. I stayed there three weeks. I also went to bed and occupied my room a good deal longer time. My cold broke up some weeks ago and I am feeling fairly well, with the exception of my feet and legs, but, dear Rose, I can no longer make speeches.

I hope you will soon be all right again. Ye shall be meeting again some of these days.

Lovingly,
COC:HW.
