Washington, D.C., April 11th 1903
609-F St. N.W.

Mr. B.A. Leighton
Dear Sir:

Yours of the 6th inst. was
duly received, the contents of which was carefully noted, by Mr. Lewis Douglass.
In reply he desired me to say that he has
no disposition whatever to make any change
regarding a stone step on the premises referred
to in your letter.

On the contrary he desires Mrs. Helen
Douglass attention called to the fact that
said premise is in immediate need of improvement both in and out, viz: notably, the broken blinds, and
especially the sanitary apartments, make it
almost untenable. It is sadly in need of a
coat of paint, which in its conspicuous position,
makes a most detestable appearance.
It is the only residence in that immediate
neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to
the Landlord-
Respectfully yours, Joseph Douglass
2596 Clerk.
