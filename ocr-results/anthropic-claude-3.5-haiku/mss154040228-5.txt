Validated,

My dear Mrs. Catt:

I'm in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit 780 - at Los Angeles, at the present with a fractured leg. I have been here 2 weeks today. I hope soon to be released from this terrible house of torture, a cast, so that I can return to my little apartment at 609 N. Fairview for, So. Pasadena, Calif. Many friends wonderful to me in many ways.

I'd draw nigh close friend Mrs. Sais Zankhus, 1918 Oak St., So Pasadena - who has all - of me in charge-

Cordially,
Henrietta G Moore
& F8
