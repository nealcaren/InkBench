Hon. Brd. Navy Com'l
Sir:

I have the honor to forward to you the publishers action of the Ebenezer Lyceum as directed, and ask your acceptance of the inclosed at token of love and respect for my recent acknowledgment.

[Newspaper Clipping]
For the Good of the Whole People.
The Ebenezer Lyceum had an interesting meeting yesterday afternoon, Mr. E. S. Atkinson, president, and A. E. Ryder, secretary. After the reading of an essay, singing of a duet, and listening to an address, the following was adopted:

Whereas It is a duty we owe to every citizen to express our grateful thanks for any and every intelligent and virtuous act of public interest and benefit done for the good of the community; and

Whereas the Hon. Frederick Douglass has, during a long life of public service, been conspicuous in the round and wholesome advice and counsel which he has spoken with honest courage for the good of the whole people and his country; now therefore,

Resolved, That in the recent address delivered by Mr. Douglass before a large audience under the auspices of the Bethel Literary Association we recognize in him our beloved and honored leader, who has honestly spoken our sentiments and fairly presented the cause of the colored citizens of our country to the extent possible for consideration.

Resolved, That we tender to Mr. Douglass our heartfelt thanks for his very able and manly statesmanship, which we proudly recognize as philosophy, philanthropy, and many courteous arguments.

Resolved, That the Hon. Frederick Douglass we recognize our own true and beloved leader - ever faithful and wise. We heartily indorse the words he has spoken, the argument he has made, and we pledge him our loyal devotion and support.

Resolved, That the President be, and he is hereby, authorized to tender the courtesies of this association to Mr. Douglass and present him with a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions.

Respectfully,
[Signature]
P. B. S. Atkinson, Sec'y
