When I first saw the light of day on this planet, in one of

her failures.

When I recall how the silent prayers, when her lips were
moving would steal by hearts, and I know, how years from
childhood to maturity, I realize that there was some subtle power
that was moulding my future. From the very first moment
I seemed to know - the future without being able to give any

Victoria never had any doubt about being a woman or destiny.
In her earliest girlhood that touch, written in 1885, in London,

Fourteenth amendment, she entered business, Victoria's
dash into public life.

She presented a memorial, on request for votes for women and
presented it to both houses of Congress. The Memorial advocated
the admission of the 15th and 16th amendments, Victoria's
statement was that no class of citizens was disfranchised more than
citizens and had the right to vote.

On January 12, 1871, she urged her case with great eloquence
before the Judiciary Committee of the House. She was the first
woman to address Congress. She made many telling telling points
about the rights and wrongs of women, the franchise. Ben Butler
was one of those who answered. He championed her cause. Mr.
Trumbull, the Senator from Illinois, supported the Memorial. If her

In 1872, the so-called Equal Rights party held convention
in New York attended by 500 to 600 men and women. The Par-

her sisters had started their magazine, Woodhull and Claflin's
Weekly, she began her newspaper, the Constitutional, an eight-

The story about Henry Ward Beecher has been circulated by the
press for many years.

In her lectures Victoria Woodhull has been discussing sex with
great frankness. The much Booth, the Beecher case was the
title of one of her lectures. She was bitterly attacked by the
guardians of morality, yet her statements were closely allied to
the most advanced thought of the day, which is now accepted.
Finally, she went into her husband, Blood, to occupy a house in the
way Hill mentions of Mr. York.

While she was there she was arrested for the publication of the
Beecher story.

She had given her story to reporters, and repeated it in Beecher
and kindred spirit newspapers, which already had become noto-
rious. She continued to attack the social evil and social depen-
dence, the corruption in the business world and Washington.
