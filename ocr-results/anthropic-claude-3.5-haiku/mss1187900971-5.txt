Grandpa was never called "Lloyd"
He was first Frederick Bailey. This slave
Changed to Johnson when he ran
away and because the man in
whose home he lived in New Bedford
Mass. was named Johnson. This man
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglas" asked
Grandpa - to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, briefly
would like to call himself
Douglass instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told him one name is two
was as good as another - and here-
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass.

These facts - not hearsay.

Later - just rec'd letter from Teel he
leaves on his "debating tour" today -
and really debates at Howard. He
will stop with Oral. Six already met
Joe's wife & Mamie and sent on word.
