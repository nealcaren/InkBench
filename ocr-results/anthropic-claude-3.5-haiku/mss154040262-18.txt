July 14th 1944

My dear Mrs. Park:

After a three week's stay in the hospital and four weeks at home, with a nurse in charge, Mrs. Catt has today discharged the nurse and is trying to get back to normal living.

She started out this afternoon to dictate some letters, but I could see that she had done enough. So I told her that I would write to a few of the old friends and tell them that she was very much improved in health and that she would love to have a letter from them.

She is now able to see people and although we limit the number per day and the length of the visits, she is enjoying seeing her friends once more.

Mrs. Slater and M shel Russell are to come out tomorrow afternoon. M may Pack comes in very frequently and she is just as much interested as ever in the news of the day and the progress of the writing world. We have set a date for the closing of the European portion of the war-that, but still keep our date a dark.

CCC sends love and good-wishes for your health.

Very sincerely yours,

[Signature]

Excerpt from letter of Mrs. Catt to Mrs. Maud Wood Park, in regard to "THEN AND NOW", Dec. 6, 1944:

"When I was eighty, they gave me a birthday party in New York and it was arranged that I was to make one only speech. They suddenly turned from 1st to 2d intention, when they got it, it was with the intention of having it printed, but I did not know that. I sent them the manuscript and they had just two days to get it printed. It was brought into the room where we were lunching, before I had finished speaking. Then Mrs. Slader made an announcement about it and called it a birthday cake with candles. Then I abandoned my have a few minutes talk, which they proceeded to give out to those attending the luncheon. It never had occurred to me to see how correct or incorrect it was, and only the other day, in going through the shelf that had the remaining copies on it, I sat down and looked it over and found it full of the most terrible mistakes anybody could have put in a pamphlet. I was the more astonished, for I had given it the most careful attention to details, feeling that I thought it was correct.

And, if we, ourselves, make errors like that in writing our own history, how can we expect the coming world, not yet born, to ever know the truth about it?"
