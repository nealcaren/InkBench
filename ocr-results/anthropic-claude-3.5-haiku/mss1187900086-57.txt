My dear Bassette.

Soon after your previous excellent letter, and before I could see him about it, Consultedly & O. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, intent for Bar Harbor, where he now is not if so-expected to remain till October; at least so say the papers. He evidently found the climate of Washington at this season, combined with his pressure of the office else so much for him.

In my last interview with him, I was convinced that time, toil, and anxiety, had made inroads upon his health and constitution; and that he must either take rest, or set would take him. For this, and other reason, knowing that a personal interview with him would be far better for me than writing him, I have not aventured the Dr. Thomas proposal to him as yet. The President, too, is so much out of the city, going so far and staying so briefly in the city, and giving this time so excellently when here to the members of his Cabinet, that I have been unable to see him since Mr. Blaine left.

It is understood here that no Consular appointments will now be made in the absence of deputy Blaine, hence no progress
