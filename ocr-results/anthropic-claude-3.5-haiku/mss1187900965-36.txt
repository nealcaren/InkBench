, sentimentalisms? On what
could the Kenneth Plagues, 3
the members of the press expend
their eloquence -?

If we presy Mrs Miller & her
dear boat, Mr. Douglas & his wife
into the employ of a by biographer,
& give logically what "United
States eloquent" have a right
to choose their own mode of
employment. but the printing
of realizing in this country
a might be ended. I trust
the day when we, the disfranchise
of numbers regrets exact equal
justice will the demand for old
with new distinction of race - no day
will any hand regards to spawn
rifle, & my best wishes for
you.

Very sincerely yours,
Douglass Lady M. Macdow.
