Washington D.C.
July 15- 1883

Dear Grandpa,

I received your affectionate letter on the 12th and we were very glad to hear from you, and I know that you are getting along nicely.

Everything is passing along smoothly here, excepting the weather which is at times almost intolerable. At six o'clock and the thermometer stands about 84½°.

Charlie has not left yet for the Eastern Settlements and I doubt if he will or not, I can't tell the latter as I don't hear him say Thursday and 1/41.
