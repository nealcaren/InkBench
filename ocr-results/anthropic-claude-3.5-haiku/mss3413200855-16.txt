I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not
send my check to the Cambridge
League for the National League.
I am enclosing a check for $50.00 of
which already paid will you
destroy this. My old check looks
sure in Cambridge as I cannot
take it up.

I hope Mass. has been getting
some rain, enough to keep down
the great fires but not been
deluged as we have been.

It has rained almost in excess
early since early May, from
the first to nineteenth of June
we had fifteen days of rain.
Will probably be broke by the
middle of July and will phone
to learn the amount of the
fund.

Very cordially
Cara Lee Pratt
