I'll provide the transcripts for both letters:

Howard University Letter (Left Side):
July 9, 1948

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

For can I tell you how genuinely delighted I was to receive your letter of June 30, 1948. I knew that Oberlin was going to confer on you at its next Commencement an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. I knew you are a Florence, graduate of Oberlin three years ago and naturally I have a sentimental attachment for this great institution. Then, too, my very dear friend, Rev. J. Baskell, Chief Editor and one of the publishers of the Kansas City Star is a Trustee of Oberlin who was the first student in the second wife, "Charlie," sister of Neville Wright.

In the coming of the Alma Mater Oberlin is in memory of Katherine.

I do hope the Trustees' decision in the case of the American Association of University Women will be favorable and I will be so grateful if you will inform me of the outcome.

My wife joins me in sending fond regards to you.

Cordially yours,
[Signature]

Mrs. Mary Church Terrell

United Negro College Fund Letter (Right Side):
July 15, 1948

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

May we ask you to take a moment or two to read the enclosed leaflet which deals with one of our critical problems -- inequality of educational opportunity for 10% of America's citizens.

It is not too much to say that upon the 32 colleges represented in the United Negro College Fund rests the major responsibility for supplying new and capable leadership - teachers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, technicians -- from our 14,000,000 Negro citizens.

[The rest of the letter discusses fundraising efforts and the importance of supporting these colleges]

Sincerely,
[Signatures of Chairman and another official]
