ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to obtain a medical degree and another was the first to be ordained a minister. Her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college and the first public speaking women was Negro slavery and for woman's rights what her father, a prominent lawyer, gave to national figures in the woman's movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to the woman's cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from girlhood in the widely varied activities of her parents, which Miss Blackwell has recorded in her book "Lucy Stone, Pioneer of Woman's Rights". For twenty-four years; Secretary of the National American Woman Suffrage Association for about twenty-five years; and President of the New England and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Associations. As Miss Blackwell's chief weapon was the pen, often anonymously, she was not personally in the public eye as much as the pamphleteer and the writing force which she was. But her work of editing the Woman's Journal, as well as innumerable leaflets, articles, newspaper letters and campaign pamphlets supplied the most effective weapon with which the suffrage cause was fought. Her love of fundamental information, keen analysis and argument. Among journalists she was regarded as an editor of outstanding ability. In the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom, through the years carrying the suffrage cause step by step to final victory.

In line with her family's pioneering interests in the field of women's education she has served Boston University, her alma mater, as a trustee since 1907.

Throughout those long years sensitive humanity has made her responsive to countless other struggles against oppression. Roused by the Armenian massacres of the 90's, she became a lifelong champion of that people. When in recent years her sympathies were rendered into English varied efforts to win them public understanding was recognized by the bestowal of the Order of Melusine.

The atrocious oppression of the Czar's government led her to active work with the American Friends of Russian Freedom. Her warm cooperation and friendship with Mme. Catherine Breshkovsky extended over many years and included the editing of her autobiography and letters.

The struggles of labor have equally enlisted her quick sympathies on counseless of free speech, of the right to organize and of other civil liberties.

Devoted to world peace, she has sought during many years to turn her talents to its service by promoting cultural appreciation. She rendered into English verse "Songs of Grief and Gladness" (Yiddish), "Songs of Russia", the Hungarian poems of Pet√∂fi and "Some Spanish-American Poets", - the latter a monument volume of over two hundred poems, opening to North Americans a new continent of literature. This work she did without pay.

Not without justification was Miss Blackwell chosen last year to receive the annual medal given by the Ford Hall Forum to that citizen of Greater Boston who has made the most notable contribution to the public weal. Now at seventy-seven years of age, frail of body but untouched in mind by the years, she continues her work with the zeal and enthusiasm of her eternally youthful spirit. Her tireless pen stands ever ready to aid the quest of freedom wherever and in whatever form it calls to her for help.
