At the bottom of the page, in small text, appears:

HARTFORD NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA

The page contains what appears to be a complex table or chart with multiple columns and rows, with numbers and text that are difficult to fully transcribe due to the image resolution. The page is numbered "11" at the bottom, and appears to be from an official document or record.

The majority of the page is filled with a structured grid of numbers, letters, and abbreviated text, which seems to be some form of record-keeping or statistical documentation.
