The Smith sisters of Glastonbury have
lately parted with a share of bank stock and
two of their pet Alderney, rather than pay
their taxes in the regular way, in our pre-
sent depreciated currency. But the Worcs-
ter Fosters, Stephen S. and Abby Kelly,
who have been refusing to pay their taxes
for several years, because Abby was not allowed to vote, have clearly got sick of the
martyr business. And no wonder, for it
was rather expensive, and the public has
been more disposed to poke fun at, than to
sympathize with, the "sufferers." The Worcester authorities have tested the Foster
some with great forbearance,--recognizing that, owing to rather muddled
ideas of the theory of taxation,
they really believed they were vindicating a principle in refusing payment.
The fallacy of their idea, as The Union has
often shown, rests upon the entirely mistaken notion that taxation is connected with
the right of suffrage or anyway dependent
on it. The world was taxed six thousand
years before suffrage was invented, and the
citizens of countries where suffrage does not
exist are taxed to-day without a thought of
protest. Minors are taxed, a residence
are taxed, and universally, is the theory and
practice of civilized and uncivilized governments, taxation is recognized as the fair contribution of the citizen to the expenses of
the government whose protection and convenience he enjoys. Not to pay taxes is a
practically unheard of a thin debt.
