Miss Mary Day Peck,
P.O. Box 104,
Geneva, N.Y.

My dear Miss Peck:

In the "WOMAN'S JOURNAL" of next week there will be a statement concerning housage totals and strangers, and this is the best I can do in the way of information.

I am expecting to call on March 21st. I have made up application for space on the North German Lloyd, but if I fail there I shall try for a steamier sailing the same date on the Hamburg-American line. When may I hope to have you go as early as that? It would be a great pleasure to have you go with me. I know nobody who would enjoy staying in Stockholm so long, but I'm not you could remain in Germany, as I think you wanted to be there a while.

I have written to ask Mrs. Potter to stay with me when she is in New York about the 1st of March. I hope I shall catch her. I presume she will not care to go until later in the season - but there is one advantage, you do get the winter rates in the month of March. I think it important that you should engage your passage soon, as I find the places are largely taken.

I have sent your name again to Miss Shaw today, together with other names in hand, & as a delegate. Will you tell me as soon as you can definitely whether you will positively go or not, and also tell me if you would like me to engage steamer passage for you.

Yours cordially,
Carrie Chapman Catt
