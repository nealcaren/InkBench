Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt
President of the Leslie Woman Suffrage Commission
New York

Dear Mrs. Catt,

I am sure you received my last letter with the receipt and my very best thanks for your draft. With this letter I have the liberty to submit to you the following communications and motions to be transmitted to the Leslie Woman Suffrage Commission in September.

1. I join in the sincere request of Meile Goudd's for an elevation of the enrolment from 500 to 1000 Dollars for 1926. I maintain from repeating how precious this augmentation of the subvention would be for our so-poor women's suffrage movement.

2. I shall forward to you in a few weeks the report about the use of the money you so kindly sent to us. In our meeting of the central Swiss board of women's suffrage this autumn we shall have a final decision on the proper use of the sum.

3. As to your inquiry about 1926 the Swiss Alliance for Women's Suffrage is ready to raise a 1000 Dollars once more for the first of April 1926, hoping that the Leslie Commission could grant us a contribution of 1000 Dollars too.

Let me thank you once more for the real interest you have in our movement and fight for the suffrage.
I remain your very sincerely,

Annie Leuch Reineck
Treasurer of the Swiss Alliance for Women Suffrage
