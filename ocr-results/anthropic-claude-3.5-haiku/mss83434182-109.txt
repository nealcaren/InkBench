UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN

[The image shows a detailed tabular record with columns for:
- No. (Number)
- Name
- Rank
- Co. (Company)
- Regiment
- Date of death
- Sec. (Section)
- Grave

While the table is partially cut off and not all details are fully visible, it appears to be a comprehensive listing of Union soldiers, likely from the Civil War, who are buried in a specific cemetery or location.

The page number "104" is visible at the top left of the page, and the header "UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN" is at the top of the page.]

Note: Due to the partial visibility of the image, I cannot transcribe all the specific details in the table with complete accuracy.
