that el Cordel not only & avid gaze
of one perfect day when el
limited the heights and clared
hands with- g'swing and thence
of the good man, with- the heart
of a child where yo return Jells

trusted among the Hers Hearne
his g'rations wrote in g'ness.
H. you know what el is I give
yourself half awake in the
early morning, with- some pleasant
cur'te station & memory drawing
on your Soul help & golden
light now & el half rise up &

work of the present has one rest
of your home been done. el was
more & one than the Convention.
Spirituality and love in you
