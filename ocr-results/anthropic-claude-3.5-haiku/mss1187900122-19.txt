London Sunday May 6, 94.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

Your letter directed & Manchester has followed me all round tell it reaches me here. I am indeed glad to get it. Then I write & find I had not even your letter to that prick; since seeing it I know from what he and others said, that while they did not expect "push" (may they say you the same compliment) I do, him knowing incapable of such a thing, still they would have a better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. Mr. White thought that since the Society has failed so miserably and I was thus left to work for myself, you would not hesitate to work for me.

It cannot go into the country telling people about this person, all gnarled and why I am unaccompanied by the person who brought me over. As the dear Kingston member of the race, a positive act or voucher
