Dear Doug Clap,

I think the quotation at the head of your article a little bit off color. There is an appeal to mercy re their theme to justice -

I think the following from the same play is better.

"You take my house when you do take the proof
That both maintain my cause; you
Take my life, When you do take the means
Whereby I live."

You will pardon the suggestion. What do you say?
