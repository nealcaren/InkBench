I am glad & feel that they have
brought her more than they have taken
away.  I have lived over and beyond
feeling pain or sorrow and am content to
feel myself beloved and helpful for a-
gain & after.

I thank you would be sorry for my
mother were you to see her now.  Her body
with such weak, feeble powers are sadly
uncharted.  The care of her is overlaid
at times, for she is the border land
between sanely and unsably, and
cannot yet be left to other hands than
mine.  She is quite an aged woman -
closely five years old.

Not yet laid as is its lot to come- large
relief that the relations between us
seem to be.  She has no more things to
speak.  Her life, and patience is comparatively
placid.  She feels caresses of love.

This beautiful book far away, hard separated
from all my friends and from the dear
interests which have heretofore made life
in those trouble contexts for a large
part can hardly be imagined than by
surrounding etc.

feeling keenly once week bereavement

remarkable manner.
