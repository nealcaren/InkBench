JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Liberia, a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1820 by the American Colonization Society (the Colonization Soc.), and established as an independent state in 1847. It is situated between 4° 20' and 8° 20' N. lat., and stretches along the Atlantic from the Sherboro River on the N. W. to the Pedro River on the S. E., a distance of about 350 miles. The country is mostly low and flat, with occasional islands from the coast from 10 to 40 miles. It is traversed by several rivers, of which the principal are the St. John, the Sinoe, the Cestos, and the Cavally. The shore is elevated and rocky in the S. E., but otherwise low, generally sandy or gravelly, seldom marshy. In the interior the country rises into hills, detached hills and lofty mountain ranges traversed by the valleys.

Many streams flow to the ocean, but none of them is navigable for more than 20 miles from the mouth; the most important are the St. Paul, navigable for 18 miles, and having 7 feet of water at the mouth; the St. John, the Junk, and the Cape Mount Rivers. The climate is thoroughly tropical. Of the two seasons, the dry lasts from October to June, and the wet from June to October. In the dry season the average heat is 84° F., while in the wet season the average heat is 78°, the thermometer never falling below 70°. To the white man the climate is decidedly unhealthy, especially on the coast; fatal to the miners and seamen; to the malaria; and even the negroes, when born and reared in another climate, suffer on his arrival here from the so-called African fever. The natives, on the contrary, are robust, healthy, and long-lived. The soil is generally very fertile. The principal productions are the articles of export: sugar from the St. Paul. Here the sugar-cane grows luxuriantly; one year's produce was estimated at 300,000 pounds. Cotton, coffee, and indigo are raised, and yields are crops annually. Coffee is excellent quality. It is cultivated with success in the interior, and also tea. The principal farming districts, besides agriculture, are the vegetables, cabbages, peas, beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.; and the fruits, lemons, oranges, guavas, tamarinds, pomegranates, plantains, pine apples, rice, sugar-cane, etc., unrivaled. The forests contain teak, mahogany, rosewood, hich trees, several medicinal plants and dyewoods, palm oil trees, shrubs, and different varieties of useful palms, among which is the best-bearing palm, from which palm oil is made. Wild animals, the elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo, leopard, etc., are now nearly exterminated. Of minerals, iron abounds, and copper is said to occur in the interior. The estimated area is 30,000 square miles; population, according to the largest estimates, about 1,066,000, of whom about 18,000 are civilized, and the rest pagans, belonging to different tribes: the Vey, mostly Mohammedans, among whom the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U.S. have established missions; the Bassas, among whom the American Baptist missionaries established a mission in 1836; the Kosos, mostly colonists; the Mandingos, the most gifted of the tribes under the jurisdiction of the republic; and the Golas. The American Colonization Society have established schools, and are progressing in all branches of civilization. Industrial processes and manufactures have been started among the people. The republic now has spring up between the republic and the U. S., great Britain, Belgium, and Hamburg, trade in sugar, coffee, palm oil, india-rubber, arrow-root, etc., are exported; cotton goods, cutlery, powder, and tobacco are imported. The country is divided into counties. Monrovia, the capital, contains about 3,000 inhabitants; and has about 5,000 inhabitants. Great settlements are Lexington, Georgia, Caldwell, Virginia, Edina, Greenville, Louisiana, Buchanan, Millsburg, etc. The annual revenue and basis of the republic, and for administrative purposes, election takes place by ballot, and even free and equal. Elections are held at intervals of every two years. Representatives are elected by counties, and hold real estate in the republic (a temporary provision), and it is provided that citizens of the U. S. above twenty-one years of four; the representatives for two. Each county sends two senators and the requisite number of representatives. Johnson was elected president May, 1883. The official language is the English. (See Stuckey's "History of the Early Settlement", New York, 1863, and Libby's "The American African Republic", New York, 1866.)
