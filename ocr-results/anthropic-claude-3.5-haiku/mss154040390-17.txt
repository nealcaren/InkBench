with the policies of our government. The only communists who ever made any trouble with Mexico were those from the United States and were sent away by the Mexican government.

The agrarian revolution in Mexico began in 1910, seven years before the Russian revolution. Professor Hockett, of the University of Texas, an old and distinguished professor, in discussing Mexican affairs, has declared: "At the outbreak of the revolution, which began in 1910, was as inevitably as was the French revolution, a social upheaval against European struggle ley in the history of France as a coloured factor." Professor Hockett and the Mexican revolution of 1910 are to be found in the history of the so-called thirty-five years Presidential reign of Porfirio Diaz."

In 1910, at the close of Diaz' administration, there were 834 haciendas holding haciendas ranging in size from 26,000 to six million acres. In the state of Morelos alone, 180,000 dedos owned and controlled the entire state.
