And him encircled now with angels
like grasp each golden word
And with my heart I hear letter once
To see my precious Land

Again I plead beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For will one stand a ransomed thing
The Lord Lord given me.

J. C. M. Harper.

Turning side.
The faded hands in which I love
I failing to decay
But God renews my spirit thought
Within - Made a will of clay.

Far me a dimness slowly creeps
Across Earth! I fail - light
But heaven found shine away my view
And move to my life.
