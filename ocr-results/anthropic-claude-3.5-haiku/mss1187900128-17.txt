I know not where to find justice
for them. I appeals to your judgment.
I have ever been friendly to the
Colored Race, having lived many
years at Cape Hatteras in the
Island of Hatteras when my husband
was a permanent commissioner there,
under the name of Pelham Laroche
& Co. We are well known to the present
President of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee for the house of Pelham Laroche
& Co. Mr. Pelton was also consul
for the United States, and the
Recognition of Hayti was effected
by him. From well known his record
in the State Department,
Be so kind as to write for us to
influence public opinion in the
favor of the Colored people.

Begging you to excuse, me for
addressing you. I remain
Very Respectfully,
Francis L. Wilson
