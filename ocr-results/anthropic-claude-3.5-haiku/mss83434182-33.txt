UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN

[The image appears to be a detailed tabular record listing Union soldiers, with columns for:
- No. (Number)
- Name
- Rank
- Co. (Company)
- Regiment
- Date of death
- Grave

While the full details are not completely legible, the page is titled "UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN" and seems to be part of a comprehensive record of soldiers' burial information. The page number "28" is visible at the top left of the page.

Most of the specific details in the table are too small to transcribe completely with full confidence.]
