Matter of Leslie.
Surrogate's Court, New York County, December, 1915. [Vol. 92.]

Mr. Leslie's heirs at law have no interest in the determination of Mrs. Leslie's heirs at law.

The unwisdom of any other construction of this act than that here accorded to it is exemplified by this case. When the common law said that God only made an heir it was replete with human and divine wisdom. Such heirs were naturally tender to the memory of ancestors. Their equity is bounded by the law of decency and propriety. Not for all the inheritances in the world would a freeman brand his mother or father, for example, as servile. It would be contrary to human experience and human instinct for blood relatives to stain their line. Any other construction of this act than that here recorded to it leads to the contraction of those rights and excites the worst passions of men.

But I ought not to dispose of this matter without some reference to the merits of the respective contentions of the parties. It is claimed in substance on the part of Mr. Frank Leslie's heirs at law that his widow could have no heirs at law of her own, as the only parent through whom such heirs could claim was by the antebellum law of this country prior to 1861 held in a servile status; all such persons, like many in the Middle Ages, being what is known in the old law as "propertyless persons," and therefore not stocks or stirps of descent. Of course, such a claim seems to us now at this lapse of time a monstrous claim. But even if not monstrous in law, to my mind the evidence purporting to support the claim in this instance is of the most inadequate and nebulous kind. Besides, the claim of Mr. Leslie's heirs is met on the part of those claiming to be either the heirs at law and the legatees or devisees of Mrs. Leslie with most indignant and many mind complete denials. In all countries where a servile status exists or has once existed, the free born and their descendants are for a long period of time

hereafter outraged by charges detracting from their own superior status, or by what they regard as an unjust attempt to include them, being of the higher caste, within the ranks of the servile caste. In view of this well-known fact, if for no other reason, this general indignation is not to be ignored in courts of justice. To my mind the cause of the indignation in this instance furnishes only another argument against a construction which would tend to bring those of alien blood within the description of heirs at law to one dying without heirs of her own blood.

On the merits of the papers presented in this matter it would seem that the origin, life and memory of the deceased lady are most unjustly attacked. It appears therefrom that all her life she was entirely free from all association with persons of servile status; that she associated exclusively with persons not of that status, some of them more or less eminent as people of letters or in other walks of life. That she bore no trace whatever of the origin ascribed to her by the heirs at law of her late husband is apparent from the papers before me. The members of the highly respectable Southern family claimed by Mrs. Leslie as her own, and by whom she was claimed, repudiate in substance all such assertions. I must say that on the papers submitted to me the contention of Mr. Leslie's heirs at law in respect of Mrs. Leslie's status is entirely disapproved. But for the other reasons already stated the application of Mr. Leslie's heirs at law must be dismissed.

Decreed accordingly.
