Dear Sir:

Clips from the Kansas City Times of the 25th. I inclose to you per your verification, or deny do, remarks of your cited accuser, and friends in this state, have read the inclosed with much surprise and sorrow.

We have been induced to believe that from New York and Indiana Grant's can be fully relied upon to cast their electoral vote for our Gallant Standard bearer. Harrison

And Motion at reply, either confirming or denying the inclosed, will greatly oblige

Yours &c
H. T. Slemming
