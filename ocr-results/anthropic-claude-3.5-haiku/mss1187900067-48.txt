ful that I am growing old,
am not now what I have
been - although times have
been quite generous writers
me - you will see by
this letter that it harden
for me to write now when my
nervures work is teady
and strong - five thy
kind regards to your
wife - in which my good Ruth
heartily joins executing this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever yours
friend and wellwisher
James H. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see
us. I say Amen. You have
now an Engagement not
fulfilled, J. H. B.
