Bailey Senn, Nov. 9th 1891

Hon. Frederick Douglas

We have a secret movement for him
to move three thousand families out
West. We are trying to making every
effort to get up the money. In the
name of God we call upon you to assist
us & get your friends to aid us. Now
this wall comes directly from the
cabins of the poor oppressed down trodden
& outcast Southern negroes & the
northern people refuse to help us we can
deal men with out a hope. All we want
is to get away from our oppressors &
then we can educate our children.
We have sent out several letters to remote
friends & we ask you to do the same in
behalf of poor suffering humanity.
For reference write address Hon.
G.B. Eaton Memphis Tenn. & P.M. at Bailey,
Truly Yours, C.H. McCombs Sec.
