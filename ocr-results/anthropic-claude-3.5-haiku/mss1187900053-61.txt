Dear Mr. Smylas

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and it will be our in hopes of provoking a reply. We really are very much in the dark about you, & do not even know whether you still hold office under the Government, as we have not heard by the Century I conclude that-you have not been doing & therefore that you have not been holding meetings over the country that is as of old. I hope that your health is good - & that you can report will of yourself & of your family
