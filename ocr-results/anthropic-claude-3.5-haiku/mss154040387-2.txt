A CALL TO ACTION
BY
CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT
A speech made at a Mass Meeting in
Memorial Hall, Cleveland, April 16, 1921

There is not an audience in this country nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the hearts of the people. There is not a evidence before which a speaker may stand to international peace that does not recognize why millions want peace, but nobody wants war. There is not anybody who does not want peace, but how are we going to get it? That is the most vital question, and it is not only a question for us to decide in our own country, in our own states and cities, before we can act collectively with other nations, but it is for ourselves individually to think our way through.

We don't settle that question when we have a million different points of view, but wait for somebody to act.

Everybody at this time is extremely careful about being non-partisan. I don't care a rap about being non-partisan, I am for disarmament.

I was for a Democratic League of Nations. I am for a Republican way of any other kind. I believe in taking action on questions of this kind and not waiting too long. It does not matter what party is in or who is President. Our country is not judged by its parties. It is judged as a nation.

Today there isn't anybody in the world who knows what we are going to do; nobody in any other nation and nobody in this nation knows what we are going to do. But I ask you if there is anybody campaigning anywhere at this moment with an earnest campaign spirit who is not apparently as stolid and indifferent as a stone. In this matter we are as stolid and indifferent apparently, as the greatest question which was ever presented to the nations of the world.

It is a curious kind of psychology that is upon our nation. We have always been a nation in favor of arbitration. It was the first treaty of that character. Everybody knows that signed the first international law in this country, I believe, that signalized the first treaty. We don't believe in war as the ideal of the nation. We are a peaceful people, and we are believers in settling questions and not force. Well, then, we are the appointed ones to lead in this question.
