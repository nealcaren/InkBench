After meeting of business in this city
some time this meeting I shall
now accompany him to Baltimore, etc.
in the past I would well have
told of self to him but I want to wish him
well, but it will not be in my power
I am now about to tell you something
which will make you think me los[t]
most fickle of men. I have decided
in this country the weight long
and I should not deprive of the fight
which the same things I am as we
just for old reason than I have to
justifying me in staying. I have decided
& this in consequence of the advice will
of the Farmers and Mrs Thompson
I will think the president a more
fair & able officer in the northern
life, of a decision feeling of this country
and bringing to to the aid of the best
Republican, so that, in these co.
and such think he would be doing for me
