Department of the United States,
Mammoria Clariu,
July 25, 1853.

Honorable
Fifth Douglas,
Washington, N.C.

Dear Mr. Douglas:

I recall your speech delivered on this occasion commemorative of Emancipation in the District of Columbia and I was particularly edified and pleased by your utterances, and surprised at the vigor and brilliancy of your powers after an almost second effort of nearly a half century duty in the cause of your people and oppressed people.
