Following the example of all elders I want to give one bit of advice, and I want to leave with you one fact which I have learned as the result of my life's experience. I do not expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may remember the fact. The advice is that when you go forth from the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from indigestion nor is the idle fantasy of a discontented mind, although those charges have both been made!

I want to ask you to be reformers -- that means giving your life to a great cause. So wherever you go, make your cause with you. There is a law of growth -- you have learned much of that during your life in college. Some regard it as the law of gravitation and how evolution works while you sleep, but I want to tell you that evolution requires evolves -- men and women of vision who are willing to live and to die for their cause. So I ask you, by your own conscience, along the line where your conviction lies to come out.

Learn to think things through, to take into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions of those who do not agree with you. The larger things look large and the little things small. The secret in solving almost all questions is to learn how to knock off the proposition else in the detail which has nothing to do with the proposition. Then you have learned that one lesson in life you will travel along the line of your convictions five hundred times as fast.

Fifty-two years ago, the young territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone -- alone in all the world. In 1868 I was a young child studying geography, and I remember my map with that great yellow splotch which included Wyoming, and it was called the Great American Desert. The granting of votes to women in some unknown state in that great desert had its origin in something that could come out of a desert? But time brought influence to Wyoming, and then the world jeered at her. I am sure that many men took good deal of pride in defending Wyoming against the political conventions and as delegates to Congress. We had here a Rocky Mountain defense, and I remember the people of the state, to my mind a very distinguished company, took that attitude which never failed to stand fast. I do not know in all those years a single instance when she faltered. The world long years ago, for an example, when I appeared in the City of Boston... [rest of text continues]
