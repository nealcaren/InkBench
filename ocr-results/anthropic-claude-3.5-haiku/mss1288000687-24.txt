NEW ENGLAND PORTRAITS
ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, a pioneer of woman's rights. Her father, Henry B. Blackwell, was an abolitionist and practically the only man who helped women to the ballot. One of Miss Blackwell's aunts, Elizabeth Blackwell, was the first woman physician in America; another, Antoinette Brown Black-well, was the first ordained woman minister. Miss Blackwell graduated from Boston University in 1881, and then worked on the Woman's Journal, carrying the paper on alone after their death until 1917 when it became the Woman's Journal. For many years she appeared annually before the committee of arrangements, and a distinguished lawyer once said of her that in a controversial matter he had ever talked the ablest presentation of every view brought to her heard. It was also through her persuasive efforts two parties of the suffrage movement, evolving from the National American Woman's Suffrage Association, of which she was secretary for nearly 20 years. She is a trustee of Boston University and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Close to her heart is the cause of the Armenians. She has rendered into English a volume of Armenian poems, and one, still unpublished, of Mexican and South American poetry. Her biography of CatherineBrekhovsky, "The Little Grandmother of the Russian Revolution," was one of her best sellers.
