Dear Mrs. Chapman Catt,

We look in our programme of last year to read lectures on Timeus, Soutzo. We have naturally kept up the N.W.S.U. and N.P.C. and popular activity course.

But as here are no complete libraries in Romania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to have the little books necessary for propaganda. So there has perhaps to be some other solution of J.N.S.R. to help.

Feeling now the lips of a pure library we will perhaps at one time with our studies, we found one at B. and perhaps that will be able to assemble round it the Women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time.

Truly your association helps for the generous act of now helps unto sisters and to extend one of the student work for women, movement in your country and specially those, where we could find biographies of your famous women.

We would speak in a first series of lectures, on political and social movement. Hasn't the portraits of young mad and Actual Science. But we know so little, it is easy, not much.
