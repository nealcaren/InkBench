Dear Mary,

Received at last your letter this 27th gift this spring. If this took little hope to attain success with all look when the author(would be) however success nor step and no vocabulary to express the genius, though it was, it will not recognize until I read it. I had not run nor league until I return it or to keep it, went thru and knew it sending you a time ago & let we say all do this is no gift from at their life & how not the resistance just out hard what any of them are, but me myself find out what will use me again, sure out of garden full of pleas to farm the ground law.

If you will feel a please to come in my garden or all I can be will either due me little blossoms that might be.

When you come I always wonder "take you been a garden ago." Come down, I shall take a looking at.
