New Haven, Aug. 15, 1890.

Dear Mrs. Douglass:

Judge Sheldon has just informed me that his family had received recently a letter from you, and that you are now in Washington. We learned that you were in Boston with Mr. Douglass, and so none of us know how to address a line either to you or to him.

I am quite desirous of hearing how Mr. Douglass is and what his plans are for the rest of the vacation. Can you give us any idea as to how you and he will come this way? We are all looking for[?]
