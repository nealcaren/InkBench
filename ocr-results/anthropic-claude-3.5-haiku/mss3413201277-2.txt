There were many pleasant things to diversify the hard brighten the hard work.

Louise Alcott, then at the height of her popularity, wrote in reply to a request for her help:

Concord, Oct. 1, 1893.

Dear Mrs. Stone:
Am so busy just now proving "Woman's Right to Labor" that I have no time to help prove "Woman's Right to Vote." I read your note along to the family, asking, "What shall we say to Mrs. Stone?" A voice from the treasurers, I say, "Well, immediately answer, take her father's instantly," replied, "Tell her you are ready to follow your leader, sure that you could not have a better one. My brave old mother, with the ardor of many questions, was urging me to go to the polls before I die, even if my three daughters have to carry me." And two little men, already mustered in, added their words, "We send, 'aint needy.' We will not vote as much as ever you like."

Such being the temper of the small Convention of which I am now president, cannot hesitate to say thank you, though I may not be with you in the body, I shall be in spirit, and am, as ever, hopefully and heartily yours,
                                    Louisa May Alcott.

Miss Alcott dropped in at the office of the Suffrage Association one day and left a check for a hundred dollars, saying that she had earned it before breakfast. In those days a hundred dollars was a large sum.
