The page contains a table titled "UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN" (the rest of the title is not visible). The page is numbered 68 at the top. The table appears to be a detailed record listing names, ranks, companies, dates of death, and other details of Union soldiers, but due to the image resolution, I cannot confidently transcribe the specific entries. The table columns include:

- No. (Number)
- Name
- Rank
- Company
- Regiment
- Date of death
- Remarks

The table spans multiple columns and rows, but the specific details are not clearly legible in this image.
