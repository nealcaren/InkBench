if you will but help
the eye of your own
spirit turned within -
for it (not within) that the
precious jewel of
truth & light is to
be sought - of faith -
And darling - you
will find it, & then
if, and live it - and
all men & women will
call you blessed -
hardly but oh so deeply

Yours O Worthy
[Signed, appears to be "Onson O Worthy" though the signature is somewhat unclear]
