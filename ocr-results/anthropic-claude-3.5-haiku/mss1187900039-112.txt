Dear Father

Yours of the 21st inst is just received. I saw an account of one of your letters in New Jersey published in the N.Y. Tribune, and I thought you might have other opportunities, not hearing from you. All are well except the baby, he has a severe cold. W. Augustus is attending him, we are afraid he will have the camp fits but hope not. I would wish to know your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and myself. I know your mind, and time is other occupied. You may know the cause of the difficulty, but believe you do not know the whole truth, and it is hard to find out under the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone against us. Shall try another way. If you will do as have any length of time I will write again soon, as I am very busy just now. Lizzie would send love if she knew I was writing. Love to mother and all.

Your aff. bro
Chas. A. Douglas
