a lecture in Washington. -
show I have. I will write once.
This is my letter of inquiry.

Have you gone up to your
journey to Clayton? If so I
cannot help being glad as this
area good many reasons why.
I have rather thank of you
little as nearer to us. - If I could
have written as formerly, I should
not have so long postponed my
inquiries. But I am obliged
to curtail my letters both as to
number & length. -

I hope that it will turn
out. That you are to pass the
winter in your pleasant area
comfortable home. Why should
you have the terror of the
weeping has and many inconveniences
when you can do with arrangement
in your quiet and tidy father
home? Note for fame or gain these

are already gone. Both of you. -
I was glad to see a notice
of your lecture and wish. That
I was there to supply it. - I'm
sure that you can make your
experience very interesting one
lecture ten. - Has them Sir.
Douglass has I doubt not his
hands full of literary work
about which you can assist
him if you have not - all that
you can do yourself. -

I shall write to Mrs. Ruggles
to day and tell her all that
I know of your movements -
because I so much I am certain,
that you cannot lecture in
Washington and be also on the way
to Phila. am. from here. -

I want the Douglass to avail
great mental strain, and to indulge his waning years that he
may stay as long as possible with us.
