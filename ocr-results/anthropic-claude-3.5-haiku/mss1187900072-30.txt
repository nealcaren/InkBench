Washington April 10th 1887

Dear Father

Your letter dated March 24th received yesterday, it found us all well, and I pleased to hear from you.

Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds is seriously sick with pneumonia. Gerrit S. Hogen has been appointed Deputy Recorder of Deeds.

The Lawyers are much put out about it. Senator Sherman is making a trip South in Georgia, a colored delegation called at his hotel and was refused admission, as soon as he heard of it, he paid his bill and went to another hotel. A colored man by the name of Taylor from Kansas has been appointed to the Siberian Mission. The political air Cork at present on the Republican side is wavering between Blaine and Sherman.

Congress has made an appropriation for a new Bridge across the Eastern Branch at the foot of Penna. Ave. Business in the Recorders Office is booming. Discussed, the President of the Anacostia R.R. is married. Barnabas has been appointed "Lampareer of Deeds". The President and Mrs. Matthews have been taken back in the pumpet Confirmation of Mrs. Trotter. They expected he would be rejected. Sawyer
