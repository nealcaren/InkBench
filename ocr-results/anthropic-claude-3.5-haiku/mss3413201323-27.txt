THE REGISTER AND LEADER, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 24, 1916

[Headline on right side of page: "When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage"]

The visible text includes multiple columns with news articles. While I can see the entire page layout, the text is too small for me to confidently transcribe every word. The newspaper appears to be The Des Moines Register, dated May 24, 1916, and contains multiple articles and columns discussing various political and current events of that time period.

The most legible headline is "When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage" on the right side of the page, which seems to be discussing women's suffrage. However, without zooming in or having a clearer image, I cannot provide a full verbatim transcript of the page's contents.

Would you like me to attempt to transcribe a specific section that might be more clearly visible?
