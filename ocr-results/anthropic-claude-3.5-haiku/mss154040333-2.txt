Dear Mr. Chapman Catt,

I just finished the superb book on The Great Work gone have accomplished during your wonderfully active life.

This book is a grand inspiration for all of us in every country.

I was deeply moved by the pages on your international work. And the meetings in Geneva, few of which I was fortunate enough.
