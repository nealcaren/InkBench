Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
Woman's Citizen Committee,
171 Madison Avenue, New York City.

Dear Mrs. Catt:

As a member of the D.A.R., I am protesting against the propaganda which the officers of the Society have adopted from Mrs. Robinson, P.R.Marvin, E.H.Hunter, etc. It occurs to me that it would be useful to be able to quote Mrs. Robinson's anti-suffrage utterances, and showing that in that campaign she was obsessed by the same fears and used the same arguments as she does now against our most useful liberal organization. Can you send me clippings of her anti-suffrage pamphlets or letters? or can you direct me to where I might find these? I am very seriously by the D.A.R. officers and by many of the being taken very seriously rank and file of members.

Can you give me any information about H.M.Haldeman, president of The Better America Federation, and president of the Pittsburgh Pipe and Supply Co., recently indicted for usury? I have been told the above facts, but have no details.

To me it seems a strange phenomenon that the officers of the D.A.R. have committed themselves to this propaganda, and I cannot help wondering if their affiliations are with the great corporations which are fighting the Diamond Match change in industrial contacts. I know how the "phossy jaw" in their unfortunate use of phosphorus which produced the Child Labor Amendment, passing a resolution to that effect at their Congress in 1926, although the Chapters throughout the country had no opportunity to discuss this resolution beforehand, - a resolution which I very much deplore. In the Report of the proceedings of the Congress of 1927, the delegate from North Carolina gave $1000. to Mrs. William Sherman Walker for her use as Chairman of National Defense.

I say all this to give you an idea of what is working in my mind, and what I am seeking to prove, and why I am trying to discredit Mrs. Robinson, and why I wish to connect Mrs. Brosseau and Mrs. Walker, and others of the D.A.R. with an interest (though it may be not very profound) in Big Business and the manufacture of war material. I am not entirely in Big Business, and the manufacture of war material is not at all prepared as yet to publish this as my object, but I would be very glad to have you will hold this letter in confidence, but I would be very glad to have any information that you can give me that might bear out my theory.

Sincerely yours,
