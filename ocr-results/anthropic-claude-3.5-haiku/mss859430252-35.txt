Tonight, we honor two of the most valiant and courageous jurists of our times... Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle and Judge John Minor Wisdom. Judges Tuttle and Wisdom (with fellow judges John Robert Brown of Texas and Richard Taylor Rives of Alabama) moved the federal judiciary in the deep south beyond its role as an institution of law and made the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Judicial Circuit an agent for change.

The Fifth Circuit judges issued landmark decisions that struck down barriers of discrimination in voting, jury selection and employment. They developed the doctrine of "affirmative duties" which shifted the burden from Black plaintiffs to school boards to dis-establish a dual school system.

Burke Marshall, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division in the Kennedy administration said: "these judges have made as much of an imprint on American Society and American law as any judges below the Supreme Court have ever done on any court."
