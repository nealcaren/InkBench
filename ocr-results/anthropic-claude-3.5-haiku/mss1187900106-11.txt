Dear Douglass:

Here I am, away up in the North West, on my feet west to my youngest daughter, Adella, the wife of R. B. Scott, who happens to be absent, just now, in discharge of his official duties, at "Soyoos Lake," in the "Okanagan Country," as they call it here. For a year and a half, until two weeks ago, almost a perfect blank in my life's journey.

To be Blind, is a terrible calamity to any human being. Since the surgical operation, two months ago, which extirpat the Cataract from my left eye, and then waiting for the painness and sensations to light, to subside two weeks ago I got my new spectacles with special glass, fitted to my left eye, and now, with the aid of that glass, I can see almost as well as ever. So much for Cocaine and for Science. Thanks to Providence, human discovery and skill for my being out so long. Nature has dealt kindly with you and me. We may yet become 1776.
