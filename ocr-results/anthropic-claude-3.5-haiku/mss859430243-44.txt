NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner
Cobo Hall
Detroit, Michigan

Greetings:

It is my pleasure and a privilege to extend congratulations and best wishes to you tonight as you gather for the 29th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner. This dinner, which brings together a great ethnic, social and economic mix of people united in the struggle against bigotry and discrimination, is vital to the work of the NAACP.

The 75th anniversary of the founding of the NAACP is truly cause for celebration. Over the years, few organizations have had as great or as beneficial an influence on our society as has the NAACP. As the foremost civil rights organization in the United States, the NAACP has persistently worked through the Congress and state legislatures have brought about a more equal society and improved the lives of millions of Americans.

Yesterday's victories were not achieved without a struggle - nor will tomorrow's. I join with you in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the NAACP and in dedicating ourselves to building a society based on tolerance, equality and opportunity for all.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
JAMES J. BLANCHARD
Governor
