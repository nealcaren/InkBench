Friend Douglas,

I started from Rochester yesterday morning to Strong a vine to Hemlock Lake.

Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp a few rods north of the Rush Reservoir.

I attached a forked instrument upon the wire and communicate with the person who took my place during my absence.

He telegraphed me the substance of your postal card. Before I left home I read your telegram, & went to the Rec. Sec. Bk. where the diff was perceived and notified them of its new receptions, and of your wish for a duplicate. They said that they could not give another until they were receiving their app. from the Clearing House at N.Y., which will be the first week
