either we-all went to the work
& talk work & talk better splendor
eight. When I come on work
ing sitting down & dont get few
lines from home stops all loss sorrow
me for not stopping my steel
with me sweet if it is possible
I most that you would have them
sent write me this time go know
how this letter short as I'm almost
bedtime and we must be up
at five o'clock I should like to
hear from home once in a while
and you shall hear from me
I know this is not the good
writing as you would know
but I'll am on hand to you
tonight

Yours affectionately
Am Charles R. Brogden
