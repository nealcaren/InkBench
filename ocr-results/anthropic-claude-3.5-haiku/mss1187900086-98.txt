Dear Dulwich Douglas

When we first saw you appointment to Hoyt. and also how many fine and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you I began to clip and stick them with the intention of sending them all on to you -) cut "lots" of them. but alas! in the huge piles of Editorial scraps they have all disappeared quite three.

I enclose-
It was pleasant to see the appreciation in which you are held, while you are able to see it.

I am not sure but we are glad to have you go. We need you here.
