RECONSTRUCTION:
A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE L. STEARNS.

ELMER, SALEM CO., N. J.
Feb. 21, 1865.

GEORGE L. STEARNS, Esq., Boston, Mass.

Sir: I lately received from you two communications, in which you advance certain propositions, and ask my influence and support.

1st. To organize the anti-slavery men of the country.

2d. To bring their combined influence to bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the Rebel States, and to extend our financial system, in a manner to secure the fullest protection of the laboring classes.

3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew, of Massachusetts, a position as the exponent of these views.

In reply, I accept with the peculiar phases of our financial system the propositions you advance, and to sustain a champion of freedom might not be as proper a contribution for me as a special demonstration of my views upon that position; but if I can be of service in any capacity, whatever my relations in the Rebellion explosive, to reconstruct the Rebel States, and reseize their opportunity for a new birth of liberty, I tender my cooperation.

That you make a distinction between a few fundamental propositions which I hold in common with the anti-slavery movement.

UNITY AND ESSENTIAL EQUALITY OF THE HUMAN RACE, God is our Father, and all men are born free and equal, and the distinction between a man and a beast is the fact of a higher intelligence. Equally have we an equal right - to life and liberty - all the developed and culture of men should secure these rights.

The Government, acting through its fullest possession and most comprehensive agency, will protect all.

In a conference held by Secretary Stanton and General Solomon, soon after that city was taken, of Savannah, some of the negroes was Governor Fraxier. On being asked, "How can your people take care of themselves?" the reply was, "The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and a free school to our children." But how can this be done? Secretary and General were marked by uncommonly deliberate and good sense, but the second. How has he a country who has no home? How habitually safe from pauperism? Not one in twenty of his family for a week past have had a full meal.

Then, you wish to spread slavery, break it up, and stop its growth. Twin strands of one rope, slavery in some form will ever bind its victim. You can't abolish slavery, to-day, the national monopoly of land and labor will repress the blacks, under the old land tenure, as certainly as did the overseer's whip. Some property and local distinction will carry a slavish spirit. The barbarous land-holders went their length on the unequal hard lines of labor. Their track was marked with cruelty against the slave. Inured to the worst usage of human bondage, his mode of life was systematic and cruel slavery, will end in giving the poor negroes, who without this provision, would be helpless, "the boon" of mere legal freedom.
