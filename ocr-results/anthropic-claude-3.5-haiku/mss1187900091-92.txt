THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE,

September 28, 1890.

My dear Douglass:

On my passage this
New York yesterday from Phila those I
spoke our Friday evening, I called at Rem-
hards & Co's office for news about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is state the clerks
in the office assured me:

This steamer is the "Orange Nassau"
She will sail from Pierrepont Street (along
side of the Wall Street ferry) Brooklyn
on Friday next, 4th instant at noon, for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on this
information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the
"Orange Nassau" is the poorest steamer of the
line. But she is stanch and sound and I
guess we can stand it for six days on board
