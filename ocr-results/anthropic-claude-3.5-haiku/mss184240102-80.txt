Friday Mar 8

My dear friend,

I write from Ithaca. I went to the - because I understood you were to be there at just that time but I could not have met you. I was sick for my Mrs L. I was very much disappointed but am glad you & mother are well.

I did take all care of my self for that future to in self for that future to in before. But this weather kills lives if it was one long summer
