SUFFRAGE IN ARKANSAS
MOTTO AND POLICY OF THE 1880 LEAGUE

"For the cause that needs assistance,
For the wrong that needs resistance,
For the future in the distance,
And the good that we may do."

By Mrs. O. F. Ellington,
President Arkansas Equality League

In 1880 an "Equal Suffrage League" was formed. This Association worked faithfully during the pioneer days with very few results, but they laid the foundation for those who were to come later.

The origin of this first League was, to say the least, unusual at the time, and found little favor in the minds of men and women alike. Strange it might have seemed then to see seven women march down Main Street to Markham Street, west several blocks to the corner of Spring and Markham, to the Lucelle Hotel. This building was owned by Mrs. Clara Cox McDarmid, the first President of the Association and then a woman of thirty years of age.

Two rooms of this hotel were dedicated to the use of the Suffragists, and were used as such until the building passed out of her hands.

Mrs. McDarmid was a lawyer, and as such realized the injustice frequently met out to women. Hoping to assist them she advertised in the paper she would render legal services to women free. Strange to say not one took advantage of the offer. The idea was too "far fetched."

One of the original members is still living in Little Rock, Ark.—Dr. Ida Joe Brooks. She is a practicing physician and has been, for twenty-five years. She tells me the prejudice against women, in the professional world, has not yet been overcome.

The first President served only a few years and was succeeded by Miss Kate Cunningham, a teacher in the public [15]
