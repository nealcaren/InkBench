Dear Grandpa:-

I have learned with much surprise, that you are still in the city of Washington enjoying an extended leave of absence from your work & duty. I am very glad that such a leave has been granted you, as I know that you are far happier in Cedar Hill than any place you can go and I only wish that matters could be so arranged as to allow you to remain in this
