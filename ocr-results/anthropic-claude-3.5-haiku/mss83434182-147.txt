The image appears to be page 142 of a document titled "UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN" (the rest of the title is cut off), which is a tabulated list of Union soldiers. The table includes columns for:

No. (Number)
Name
Rank
Co. (Company)
Regiment
Date of Death
Size
Grave
Original Place of Burial

The page lists 35 soldiers with details such as their name, rank, company, regiment, date of death, and burial information. The soldiers appear to be from various regiments, primarily from states like Illinois, Wisconsin, and other Midwestern states. The dates of death range from 1863 to 1868, suggesting this is a record of Union soldiers who died during or shortly after the American Civil War.

Would you like me to transcribe the entire table with all its details?
