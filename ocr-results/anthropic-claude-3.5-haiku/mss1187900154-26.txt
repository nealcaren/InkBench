My dear Mr. Douglas:

I look for the last car of furniture morning of now I have put off so long my calling on you & Mrs. Douglas that I shall be unable to do so. Do me the my excuse for your great wife for me. I remember her with so much pleasure in Paris. I hope to turn to Chicago later in the old summer & Then I will not fail to see you both. &
the meanwhile believe me,

Very Truly Yours,

Theodore Stanton,
