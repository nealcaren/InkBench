Translation of Dr. Freud's letter of December 20th, 1921

Dear Mrs. Cath-

I did not reply immediately to your last letter because I wished to send some inquiries on the steps we have taken with our Government.

We have obtained copy of the telegram sent by Dr. Le Breton, Argentine Minister to Washington, who sent to our Government by the United States Legation here. In both communications it is established that the Congress is not official and that consequently the delegates cannot be official.

We are awaiting the response that our Government will make to the demand that was made to aid us in bearing the expenses of the delegation, because the $6000, of which the note of the Studtodsy of the United States speaks, is absolutely insufficient, as the period of the Delegation is less than $400. We would like to know whether each delegation is expected to bear its hotel and transportation expenses in the United States.

I hope that we shall obtain the support of the government; we shall communicate this to you immediately.

I urge that we may receive as soon as it is possible all publicity that you may have on the Congress, in order that the names of other South American delegates may be published in our press.

My next letter I will tell you whether I can go myself to the Congress, as it is my greatest desire to do so.

I hope to have soon the pleasure of seeing you; and in the meantime accept the expression of my best wishes.

Alois Moreau
