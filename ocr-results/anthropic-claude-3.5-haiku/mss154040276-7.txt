Jan 20th 1919

My dear Mary:-

I feel perfectly ashamed for not having written to you all these weeks since I am staying with our dearly beloved Chief. However here lately it is not much to day to day and I did not have to send you a hurried note but a real letter full of details which no one else could give you. Mrs Catt rode with parts of your letter and we are both much interested in your lovely trips and we sing so glad you are having such a grand time. You certainly can give the liveliest descriptions of things and we much enjoy the amusing spirit and wit will to begin with the beginning.

Before I came I was entirely very worried about Mother Catt and I just could not wait the day to leave. Then I came on a Saturday afternoon - Dec. 8th and the dear Lady was waiting for me on the platform in New Rochelle. Well you can imagine that the first two days there was very very much to take about and to tell. The dear lady just poured it all over to me and it seemed to relieve her greatly, although there were many tears, I will fell the like to tell
