This appears to be a detailed tabular data sheet or chart with numerous rows and columns of numbers and abbreviated text. The details are quite small and densely packed, making a complete verbatim transcription challenging.

At the bottom of the page, the text reads:

BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA 25

The page number "25" is visible, and the text is inverted (reading from bottom to top).

Due to the complexity and density of the chart, a full transcription would require close examination and potentially magnification. The chart seems to contain numerical data with various abbreviations and categories, but specifics cannot be confidently determined without further detailed review.
