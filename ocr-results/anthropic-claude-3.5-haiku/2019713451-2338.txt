Elements.

Principles of Small Letters.

Scale of Lengths.

Principles of the Uprights.

Give Special Heed to these Directions.
This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions here given take for granted that those on the cover of No. 1 have been studied and followed. In this No. the letters formed from the first four principles are reviewed, and the elements, a, d, p, o, are introduced.

The Contractions used are as follows:- m. l. Main Line; c. l. Connecting Line; m. a. Main Line Slope; c. a. Connecting Line Slope; m. Modified; pl. Parallel; pr. Principle; k. Element.

The Diagram on the cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths. The way the copy is made is also shown.

SUGGESTIONS. 1. The only possible way of teaching Penmanship successfully in a school, is to have all the scholars of the class write the same line in the same book at the same time.

2. The order of Instruction is KNOWLEDGE, EXECUTION, CRITICISM.

First, Knowledge. Explain the copy carefully, and have it analyzed into its Principles and then into its Elements. Teach the nature, peculiarity, slope, beginning and ending of each element; notice the correctness between the principles, and the combining lines between the letters; call attention to similitude and parallels of parts and lines.

Second, Execution. Let them first trace only with dry pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing the pupils to be very careful as to position, penholding, rests, and movements, which are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should be high enough from the desk to allow a holder to be passed under its right side.

Third, Criticism. Criticise the line written, by asking questions on each particular point given as knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The errors lie, of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is a curve, It may be curved the wrong way, or too much or too little; if sloped, then too much or too little; the turn will be correct, or too broad, or too narrow. Select one or two of the most prevalent faults, discovered by the answers and by your own observation, for correction, direct especial attention to them, and have one more line written that they may be corrected.

Then criticise these same points, see how many have succeeded in correcting them, and write one more line. Thus, criticise the execution of each line, and direct attention to the correction of fault after fault until the whole is perfected.

GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the sides of the oval written downwards; the ovals, the second upstroke of b and r, and the second and fourth of w. See Manual, Chap. III. 4. The Connecting Lines are the rest of the curves written upwards. The Turns unite main to connecting lines. Sometimes the main and connecting lines unite in a point; this is termed a Connection. The blue formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into one another at the middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 4. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are five Elements, numbered in the order in which they occur in the principles. There are six Principles in the small letters; from these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts, all the small letters are made. 6. The red lines mark the columns; each of which is divided into three oblongs or boxes. Write down the columns always. 7. The m. a. is 50ยบ from base-line.

N. B. Teachers will find our Manual of Penmanship a complete compendium of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tables are invaluable for presenting the Elements, Principles, and Capitals, of large size and perfect form. The Oblique Lines are a great help to the scholars in acquiring correct slope.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES.
COPY 1. KNOWLEDGE. The 1's and 2's are respectively. The top of 1 is a little more than half across the box. Mind the slope of 2's, and the distance between them.

Observe Rules 1, 2, 3, 7. Analyze P. 1 from Diag. on cover. P. 1 has been fully explained in No. 1, which see. Its analysis is P. 1 = 3 E. 1 + 1 2 = 3 4 3. Notice that the second 2 is perfectly straight through 3 of its height and sp. to the first 2, with which compare it. Call attention to the bend which forms the left side of the turn, and to the way in which the right side slants up directly the turn has touched the base line. Caution against making a broad turn by turning too soon on the left, or sagging down on the right side.
