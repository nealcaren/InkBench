New York, November 17th, 1919.

Dear Chief:-

The 26 signed checks have arrived O.K. I have my eye on the mortgages falling due "on the old place." There are dramatic possibilities 't'would only had a red villain in the background to give an alternative between foreclosure and marriage, to while he eats down-stage and kisses'll break you yet no trend beginning!  I shall of course await your advice on this matter.

"We" may forwarded under date of November 18th a cable for "Miss MacMillan still save come-

"Cable from London signed MacMillan quote Spanish invitation received
and your own confirmation for it is for December due. Also send immediately draft of Stevens latter appreciation for Goode for convention."

This I followed a telegram of my own summarizing the returns on the vote as below:-

"Officers vote one note no returns from Central Powers stop
Several voting none and none both Spain and Switzerland argues
if majority affiliated Socialist favor Spain stop will probably
influence formal attitude affiliated International prevent Socialist
prevent more even conflict from similar delicate. Poland recourse
Congress if now central points only following by careful reading
in Madrid for all with our public department." A pending full
report follows incomplete.

Several of the voting wires include excerpts as follows:-

"Schurman or officer and president:-
These very unlikely in principle. There should be
anticipations not legislation; some time before of the Board of
officers be made who have already voted."

Bergman:- "I think this is the best progress that has been made
to far. It means we are tremendously without precedent. We are not
blind to the drawbacks, especially the increase in the
possibilities against which will be felt very heavily by
people living in this part of the world."

Statement:- "If the weight of the associations affiliated to the
Alliance pronounce for them in plain, let we would very much
prefer a position in Switzerland. Our country is increasingly
backward in the matter of war, suffering, and we restlessly
at the psychological moment in this great effort would be made.
And as with us, all is the masculine directors and not parliaments,
who want recognize on right, might and public opinion as having a Congress."
