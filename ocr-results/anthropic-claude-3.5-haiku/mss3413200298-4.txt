Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note go unanswered, even if the checks I would like to have must be omitted.

I have always admired Mrs. Blackwell, and, in late years, have loved her especially. Her always wonderful spirit, her business and social worker, and her indescribable spiritual pace are such lonely additions to the great background of her life's work.

It wrings my heart to know that she, too, is facing a puissance vacuum. There are so many who are! I am one of them myself. They share in making the fund which I share are writing. Being a starving artist is a most painful handicap, in every way - but in particularly hard to endure, when opposed like this come.

Thank you for including me as one of her friends, - which I must heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett.
