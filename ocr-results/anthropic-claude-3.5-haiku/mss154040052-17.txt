Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,
Chilmark,
Martha's Vineyard, Mass.

My dear Miss Blackwell:

Summer has come to a sudden end here and it is cooling off so fast that I suppose you will be creeping back to Boston soon.

I have now received a copy of your book. It is issued with excellent taste and I think it is just the right size for a biography.

I thank you most emphatically for the explanations you have made in your letter. After reading Mrs. Dorr's life of Miss Anthony and which, of course, was only written in order to say that there never had been but two suffragists worth continuing - Miss Anthony and Miss Paul, I happened to meet Harriet Stanton Blatch at the Women's University Club. She lives there, I believe. If she had read Miss Dorr's book. She said "no". I told her that I thought Miss Dorr had even her mother come pretty hard knocks. She smiled a little, but looked as though she had no intention of reading that biography.

I think there were some mysteries within the National notion about which I have received no hint. It has been my own friend that Mrs. Blatch hated Miss Anthony, but because she was a friend of her mother's, she did not make the fact public. Of course I never came in contact with Mrs. Stanton or I had barely met her and had taken lunch at her house once or twice. I never liked nor admired her, although I had thought she had a ragged with her pen and that some of her suffrage statements were beautifully constructed. I believe that Miss Anthony always thought she could expect anyone else in style and strength of her appeal and that she was a reason why she clung to her.

I always thought it strange that she may have been other influence of Mrs. Stanton. It always seemed to me that she thought and did things because Mrs. Stanton indicated that that was the way to do them. By the time I came into the movement Mrs. Stanton had practically gone out and yet, despite that fact, the memory never entirely recovered her independence and freedom from her influence. I have always doubted whether it was simple action and devotion or if there were other reasons. I still wonder.
