The luncheon takes place at 1 o'clock P.M.
and the length of time devoted to ad-
dress is about an hour, just minutes
at most.
Please let me have a short sketch
which we may use for publication in
our newspapers relating to yourself
and your public work. We would like
to have this by Thursday A.M. & the coming
week as it can be included in League
notes for next week.
Mr. Harris and I shall be very much
pleased to have you as our guest
while in our city.
