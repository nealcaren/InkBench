My dear Mollie:-
I gave you this place for a cable and note is here. We remain another day but I suspect that progress is in the direction of requiem & that you have not cabled at all.

Mch 27. I was interrupted here and now leg at Jungs are different and time has passed. Your cable has been received, and it was quite a relief together. I imagine you passing through that discouraging stage when you think you never will be well again and when life has lost art its fervor. Well, keep up your courage and you'll pull through. I am so glad you are better. This world must be a black and place indeed under Miller, I expected to hear of you a note now because of your at it SP was a good cable for it would be a good mail station, but it seems many luminant
