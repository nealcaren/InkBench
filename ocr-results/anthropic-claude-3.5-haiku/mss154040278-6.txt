Dear Fred and Adda alluded the
league of W. Cols and I dodged any
among them and along home or
night brought a blue dress and
received a letter.
I'm hoping the war not end
in the South East and shall the Turks
in their white petty so much shake the
magic home where at last me
will commit suicide.
When we, met again and not
sure he so clean as you are.
S. Remgyl well do we not if you will
be "a shining woman"
Carrying forward
