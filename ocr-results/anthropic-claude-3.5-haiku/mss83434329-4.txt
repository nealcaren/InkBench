Since the text spans two pages (4 and 5), I'll provide a complete transcript. However, the text appears to be part of a congressional debate or document discussing slavery. I'll transcribe the visible text:

[Page 4]
cure rather than a blessing. I would not, at once, either
[remainder of first paragraph partially cut off]

[Page 5]
more obvious than the danger of failing to accomplish any
thing by a premature effort to accomplish at once all that
can be done.

[The rest of the text appears to be a detailed discussion about slavery, congressional proceedings, and legislative efforts. However, due to the image resolution and text being partially cut off, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire text without potentially introducing errors.]

Would you like me to attempt a more detailed transcription, or is this summary sufficient?
