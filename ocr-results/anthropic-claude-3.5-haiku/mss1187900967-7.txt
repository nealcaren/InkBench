were at your house! Nevertheless
should you come, a father's house,
a father's home, a father's welcome
will be given open. You would
find me in very pleasant surroundy
not quite such as I have on Cedar
hill - ogt very well adapted to
this climate and country. I
note what you say of young
Cook. I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
I feel even more sorry state to
know that he loved twice,
doth a man trick. She
did a good deal for him. That
is perhaps the trouble. And she
done let him that she would have
received more thanks. Gratitude
is not a very strong feature
feature of the Colored race.
