Oct. 8, 1954.

My Dear Daughter, - I hope you are still getting along alright. We are still, bark is still on the job. and keeping the house to summer time. That, despite the nice bright weather we are having.

Brother and part of the family were here last night. They brought more cotton, over to church and waited here while she was in service.

Darcy was not feeling well. she had been to the Doctor early in during the day. He gave her Va shot. and she says it left her feeling dizzy and sleepy. she did not look well at all. so I called to-day, said she was feeling better.

I am sending a letter that came to-day from Higgarden, and one that came last week. so I will forward them to-day on write when you can. much love from us to you.

from mother
Leona.
