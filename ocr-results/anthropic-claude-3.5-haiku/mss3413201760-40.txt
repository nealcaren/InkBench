money spent for the building of one modern battleship, or,
as Mrs. Johnson has brought out, the length of time it would
take to throw away a billion dollars at the rate of one dollar
a minute. She had the information; she talked about it; she
wrote about it; and she did something about it.

And then the scene changes: I am in the Rest House on
Corey Hill with Mr. Mead. I chat with him for a little while
about all kinds of things - old places and old friends - and
then reference is made to his wife. His face changes, and his
voice changes, as he says: "How I miss her here; she is so
good, so kind. Others can talk about her brilliant mind and
her great activities, but they do not know her as I know her.
Here am I, and at home she has the care of a sick sister and
so many other cares, yet she comes to visit me every two or
three days, and without her I should hardly be in touch with
the world. She is almost like St. Paul with the care of all
the churches, yet one more duty that must be done."
Such was the beautiful relationship of husband and wife.

So as we pause in memory of Mrs. Mead, who is here
with us tonight, I know that she will deeply feel and under-
stand that all of her labors, self-sacrifice, service and devotion
have gained for her for all time the love and admiration of
her husband and of her friends everywhere.

Mrs. Nasmyth:
And so friends everywhere testify that, with unquenchable
zeal, Lucia Ames Mead made war on all the enemies of the
Good, the True and the Beautiful. We are together to
honor a life so profoundly dedicated, so utterly consecrated,
so heroically sustained. In answer to that life, let us here

highly resolve that Mrs. Mead shall not have lived in vain,
and that, with increased devotion, we shall carry forward the
unfinished tasks which she has thus far so nobly advanced and
to which she gave the last full measure of devotion.

The meeting was brought to an end with the
Slow Movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

We do not claim that the above addresses are verbatim reports
of the tributes given at the Memorial Meeting, but we hope
they will present a fairly accurate idea of the proceedings.
