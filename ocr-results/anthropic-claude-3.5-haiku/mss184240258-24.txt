My Dear Miss Dickinson:
Your valued notes of the 6th was duly received.

I have just received your thank acknowledgment for the Indian school journal reference with Mr. Dorgan for the most flattest write up I ever saw in our Logansport journal.

Trusting, my brother, are well and you see in expressing our high regard of consideration for my and ours.

I was yesterday at Indianapolis where we had a memorable lesson distribution - We hope some of your friends will have to regret Indiana after Nov. 6.

Yours respectfully,
