Dear Mr Daniels

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and I write now in hopes of provoking a reply. We really are uncomfortable in the dark about you, & do trust some kind Whitburn friend will hold office under the Government, as we have not heard to the contrary I conclude that you do? & therefore that you have not been suffering as hitherto meetings over the Country have not worked as of old. Hope that your health is good â€” & that you can report well of yourselves & of your family.
