Dear Mrs Brown

I can't let your note about
Miss Blackwell for unanswered, but
of the check I write like to send
must be omitted

I have always admired Miss Blackwell,
and in her past year, have heard the
especially thought beautiful chris-
mass and Passion music from arts
indomitable spirit I feel grateful and her
nortely addition to the great back-
ground of the life work.

It warms my heart to there that
she, too, is facing a financial recession,
there are so many will not do at
there of their own selft in great way.
as for myself, it occurs a would
share more, the Foundation, for
painful hardships arising, but is a most
particularly hard to endure when appears little
like like "to come."

Thank you for including me
as one of ten friends, whose
I most heartily am

Sincerely,

Mary Ware Dennett
