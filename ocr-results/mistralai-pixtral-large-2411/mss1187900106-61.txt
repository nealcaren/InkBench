JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

**Liberia,** a republic on the western coast of Africa, occupying an area of about 43,000 square miles (500 miles square), and established as an independent government by the American Colonization Society in 1847. It extends from Sierra Leone south and southeast about 350 miles, stretching along the Atlantic from the Sherbro River on the north to the San Pedro on the south ; and eastward from 60 to 40 miles, extending inland from the sea from 18 to 40 miles, its area, which is steadily increasing by purchases from native chiefs, being estimated at 43,000 square miles. The shore is elevated and rocky in the S. E., but gradually subsides to the west and northwest into a deep alluvial swamp, which insures the coast a safe harbourage for vessels. Inland from the swamp, the country rises, revealing to forest-covered mountains from 200 to 650 feet in altitude.

Many streams flow to the ocean, but most of them are navigable to but a short distance from their mouths; the most important are those flowing from the mountainous region, such as the Saint Paul, Saint John, and Cavalla Rivers, and having 1 to 2 fathoms of water at low tide at their bars at their mouths, rise with the floods to 3 or 4 fathoms. The climate is thoroughly tropical, raining almost constantly for ten months of the year, extending from April to October. In the dry season the average heat is from 65 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. In the wet season the average heat is 78 degrees and in the dry season the average is 81 degrees. Yellow fever, and a disease called *dysenteric fever*, to sometimes prevail, but these are by no means deadly - not from its excessive heat or dampness, the climate owes its reputation of being unhealthy to the bad sewers and the drought, caused by the want of rain, when rain could be caught in thatched-over barrels, which serve as rain-spouts.

The capital of the republic is Monrovia, another of another great West African town called Freeport, which is inhabited by American Liberians and the pure natives. The soil is very fertile, especially in the coastal districts, and is well watered, although the greater part of the country is covered with dense forests. Rice of excellent quality is cultivated with sugar cane, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, and india rubber. Oils are also obtained, and the forests contain mahogany, rosewood, ebony, iron tree, and camwood, which constitute valuable exports. Gold, iron, and copper ore are found in the mountains.

In 1800, the population was estimated at 600,000. The inhabitants are divided into two main classes, namely the Liberians and the natives. The Liberians are English speaking descendants of the early immigrants, principally citizens of the United States and California. The natives belong to different tribes, among which are the Mandingoes, the Via tribes, and the Krus. The religion of Liberia is principally Christian, the Protestant Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist churches being chiefly represented, though the religion of some portion of the aboriginal population remains indigenous. The schools, of which there are many, are chiefly in Protestant hands; the Supreme Court is Protestant. English is the official language of the republic and runs largely into all departments. Professional and scientific men, the teachers, and many of the higher grade workmen are foreigners.

The American Presbyterian Church was established in 1833, then the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1836; the American Baptists in 1836. The United Methodist Church in 1833, and since that time many societies have been established in Liberia.

Commercial resources of Liberia are great, timber, ivory, camwood, and tobacco are imported, and various kinds of fruit and other products are produced, such as rice, cocoa, coffee, sugar, dyewoods, ginger, and timber (the most valuable of all the exports). There are also trade cannot be dependent on the United States, the United States shut down against Liberia and all trade was swept up.

The republic is governed by a president, who is elected for two years; the senators for two years; and the representatives for six years; each branch electing its officers to represent biennial sessions in a house of representatives of 100 members. The representatives present paper petitions to the Upper House.

The estimated population in 1856 was 700,000, of which there are 50,000 were free and equal. Slavery has never existed in Liberia. Emigration of Liberians began in 1822. The Nigerian Expedition was the beginning. The Colonization Society, begun by Robert Finley, of New Jersey, his American Colonization Society's Of Maryland Colonization Society's Of Baltimore Washington Society, is founded in 1817. The Republican party's come back in 1870 it was elected presidency by eighty two votes for Joseph Jenkins Roberts, who served four terms, from 1848 to 1856, and returned from 1872 to 1876.
