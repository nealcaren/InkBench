I came to Boston in Nov. 69
I must make a short visit before winter, if
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone.  I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times.  I have
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly.  My heart is not broken plus
not broken easily.  I thought I should
see you here this spring, because Mr. McKean's
sane so, it has been a trying winter,
but spring & violets are near us now.
Ninie writes me often, it is keeping of
her bit of house-work with very nicely.
But if she is shut in, she is quite a
an-ouver 'selbie.'  That the Freels, the Hasket
Chapels. She has a good-practical man, to
keep her from every sunheart of things.  Isn't
easy.  I can hide you nearer always.

Lovingly.  You mine Lasar.
