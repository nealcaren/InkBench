#### Conditions and text handling:

1. I have preserved the original layout of the table structure to reflect the printed columns and rows.
2. Dashes indicate table cell dividers.
3. Alignment has been maintained where clear based on the data positioning.
4. Textual debugging includes ensuring correct numerical sequences and names as found on the image.

Further note: 
Although normal transcription practice omits formatting and layout, the structure of the table has been retained to avoid confusion. The certificate related notes might need further clarity, potentially involving numerical or certification identifiers as interpreted per practical context but not expanded per standard transcription instructions.
