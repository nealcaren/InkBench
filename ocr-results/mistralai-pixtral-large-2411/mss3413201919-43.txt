PETITION FOR THE JUST AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN.

The Legislature of the State of New-York have, by the Acts of 1848 and 1849,
ratified the purpose of the People of this State to place Married Women on an
equality with their Husbands in regard to the holding, conveying and devising of real
and personal estate;

We, therefore, the undersigned Petitioners, inhabitants of the State of New-York,
male and female, having attained to the age of legal majority, believing that Women,
alike married and unmarried, should be entitled to all the rights and privileges
guaranteed to them by the State and Assembly of the State of New-York, do appoint
a joint committee of both Houses to revise the Statutes of New-York, and to pro-
pose such amendments as will fully restore to the Women of this State their just
rights, and hereby ask a hearing before such committee by our accredited Repre-
sentatives.

PETITION FOR WOMAN’S RIGHT TO SUFFRAGE.

Whereas, according to the Declaration of our National Independence, Govern-
ments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and earnestly re-
questing the usurpation of privileges, we do most respectfully ask the amend-
ment of the Constitution of the State as will secure to Females an equal
right to the Elective Franchise with Males; and we do hereby request a hearing
before the Legislature by our accredited Representatives.
