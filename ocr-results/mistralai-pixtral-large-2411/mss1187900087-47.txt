that after a battle of two hours they (the

Northern forces) were repulsed leaving

many dead and wounded, and that order
and tranquillity reigned in the South.

We shall have on the 19th a mail of the
10th from Porto-Prince via Havana, a cable on
28th via Cuba and a mail again on the 25th

[indistinct].

I continue to believe that the
Northern forces will resume the siege and
retreat to the North, proclaiming perhaps
“secession,” and that the unfortunate state
of things will continue for 3 or 4 months.

If the Governments of Cleaveland and Warre-
ton had acted in good faith in their rela-
tions with Hayti, this war would not have
lasted.   I ask myself if it would not
be well for one to go to Port au Prince with
Mr. Douglass to see if the two parties content-
ing cannot arrive at an honorable understanding.

Aunt, my dear Douglass, this letter is already so
long that I must cease it about right here.

Very sincerely and very cordially your,
[Mr?] Bassett and [Tally?]

Will write to Man Douglass
