I prune, and I trust I shall
have your approval as well as
that of friend Barrett.

Mr Blaine has been sick in New
York for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get over it. There
is much mental manifested in
his condition.

I thank you for long and very
kind letter and regret that I don't
feel well enough to pay to you
now all that I had it in mind
to pay when I began it. But we
all worked out even when we are
young [men] ambitious to run
a long once.

With very kindest regards,
Yours truly,

DW Fanthane
