GORDON PARKS

Born in Fort Scott, Kansas on November 30, 1912, Gordon Roger Alexander Buchanan Parks had to leave home at fifteen, when his mother died. For the next twelve years, he lived mainly in Minneapolis, Minnesota – working as a piano player, bus boy, dining car waiter, Civilian Conservation Corpsman and professional basketball player – before taking up photography in the late 1930’s and moving to Chicago.

In 1942 he was awarded the first Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in photography, and chose to work with Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in Washington, D.C. During World War II, he was an OWI (Office of War Information) correspondent. Later he joined Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) as a photographer working out of New York City, and living in White Plains, N.Y. and published articles and photographs in Glamour and Vogue magazines.

In 1949, he joined the staff of LIFE magazine and worked there as a photojournalist until 1968, doing over 300 assignments and articles on a wide variety of subjects. In the 1960’s he became famous for his stories on the leaders of the Black Revolution, articles later incorporated into his book, Born Black. Gordon Parks continues to write and photograph for LIFE occasionally, while pursuing his many other projects. He was a founder of Essence magazine, and its editorial director from 1970 to 1973.

His film career began in 1961 when he wrote and directed a documentary, Flavio, the story of a boy from a Brazilian slum, which [ THE TRUMPET AWARDS ] Parks made famous in LIFE and later in a book. Another famous LIFE story became his second documentary, Diary of A Harlem Family, 1968, for which he received an EMMY Award. His first Hollywood film was The Learning Tree, which he produced, and directed and for which he wrote the screenplay and the musical score.

Parks then directed the movies Shaft, Shaft’s Big Score! (for which he wrote the classic music score), Shaft in Africa, Super Cops and Leadbelly.

He has also been commissioned to do portraits of photography for museums, private collections and special occasions. His best-selling book The Learning Tree, published 25 years ago, is still in print in 9 languages.

Parks has received many awards for photography, writing, directing and his humanitarianism. Among his most valued are the NAACP’s highest award, The Spingarn Medal, and the Golden Gold Medal of Merit. He has also been the recipient of honorary degrees in literature, fine arts and humane letters from colleges and universities across America.

The John F. Kennedy High School in New York, not only named its media center after him, but also gave him an honorary school diploma because he had to leave school just short of graduation during the Depression.
