Dear Father

Your letter dated March 24th I
received yesterday; it found us all well, and
pleased to hear from you.
Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds, is seer-
iously sick with pneumonia.  Henry S. Higgon
has been appointed Deputy Record of Deeds.
The Lawyers are much put out about it.
Senator Sherman is making a trip South to
Georgia.  A colored delegation called on him
at Albany Hotel, and was refused admission, so soon as
he heard of it, paid his bill and went to another hotel.  I called on Mammie the same a
day from Kansas has been appointed
to the Liberian Commission.  The political
air is cool, as present, on the Republican side
on a wavering between Blaine & Sherman.
Congress has made an appropriation for a
new Bridge across the Eastern Branch
at the foot of Pennâ€™a Ave.  Business in
the Recorders Office is booming.  I received
the President of the Annexation R.R. and
nailed Mr. Hutchins has been appointed Clerk
Of Deeds.  The President and Mrs.
Hutchews have been taken back in the
Comptacter untimation of Mr. Trotter.  They
expect he would be reelected.  Lawyers
