PRESS RELEASE; For P.M.s, Thursday, March 30.

A test case on the District of Columbia anti-discrimination laws of 1872 and 1873 will be tried in D.C. Court on Friday, March 31. The case, "District of Columbia v. John R. Thomson Co.", will take place on the 2nd floor, Municipal Court, Criminal Division, 5th St. between E and F Sts. N.W. at 1:30 P.M.

The Thomson Cafeteria at 725 14th St. NW is to be prosecuted by the D.C. Corporation Counsel for violation of the 1872 and 1873 laws against discrimination because of color in restaurants and other public places. Clark King will be prosecuting attorney. The complaining witnesses on whose complaint Mr. King is acting are:

E Mary Church Terrell - for two terms a member of the D.C. Board of Education; charter member, N.A.A.C.P.

E David H. Scull - Member of the Society of Friends.

E Rev. Arthur F. Elmes - Pastor of the Peoples Congregational Church.

E Miss Essie Thompson - member of the United Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers U.L.A.

The witnesses were refused service at the Thompson cafeteria on Feb. 28, 1950 on the ground that three of the group are colored, by Mr. S.W. Becker, regional superintendent of the Washington-Baltimore district of the Thompson chain.

According to a ruling of the corporation counsel, the law against discrimination for color in restaurants is now in effect, but no further prosecutions will be agitated upon, although complaints will be accepted for further prosecution, until the outcome of the Thompson case. Some restaurants have expressed their chance to all persons regardless of race, since the Prince George's case, though the corporation counsel, that the law is still in effect. The Washington Restaurant Assn. has advised its members not to obey the law at present.

In anxious curiae brief will be filed by the Coordinating Committee for Enforcement of the D.C. Anti-Discrimination Laws. This group is a centralized body set up by the D.C. Chapter of the NAACP following an opinion issued by the Corporation counsel. The opinion was issued in May 1949 holding that the laws have never been repealed, and has been concerned solely with their bringing out the laws inside the city. Vivian Jenkins is the chairman of the committee. The attorneys are favorably disposed to the enforcement of the laws. Mrs. Margaret A. Haywood is the attorney representing the committee.

Because of the widespread interest in the case, it is expected that a number of other organizations will appear as friends of the court to file anxious briefs.

Mr. John R. Thompson Co. is represented by Mr. Ringold Hart, attorney for the Washington Restaurant Assn.

Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, chairman of the committee seeking enforcement of the law stated:

"Persons who are trying to enforce the anti-discrimination law here in Washington are rendering their country a great service. They are trying to stop its being disgraced any more by preventing hotels and restaurants from refusing to serve colored people in the Capital of what is called the greatest democracy on earth."
