a cough and had been very
near death, when a visitor
to him, Dr. Segge, tried his
new dentifrice here, said
he could cure him and
put one drop of
Turpentine on the navel.
The cough stopped
and he rallied and about
2 o'clock - day - The doctor had
tried everything without
avail and as the case
not seriously harms him
[I] thought you might try
it for your husband.

He has too [?] men
of the caliber of Judge
Terrell, to lose them, if
anything can be done to
save them and I trust
to the time this reached
you, you will not need
the strange other remedy
that your husband will
be well on the road to
recovery.
