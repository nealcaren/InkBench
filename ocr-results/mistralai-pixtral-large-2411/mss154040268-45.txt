To the Speaker's Bureau.

These roses are sweet, beautiful, temper dispelling, but poesie and verboten.
Rich your money & dispel the quiet & radicalize my character. Please dont disobey orders again & have a rile luquer, growing riper every day, which shows what polite conduct as for a woman & is a daily comfort tombiness the placidity of the Speaker's Bureau.

New York City, October 1915.
