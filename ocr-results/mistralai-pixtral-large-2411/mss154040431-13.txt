ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%

*Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race, Berlin*
*Telegram, October 14, 1917*

(Advice) - Although the Allies declare that the German
army is not as fit as formerly and that the children born this year will be weak,
a statistic compiled by a noted Berlin statistician,
Professor Ploss, proves the contrary, and shows that the war has
had a beneficial effect upon the nation's morals - that they are
better than they were before the war began.

According to figures of the latest government return, the number of
illegitimate births per 1000 of population is now only 10 percent, which is
between two and three percent better than the condition in 1913.
Statistics show that this is due entirely to marriages among the younger people
of the empire during the war.  The decrease in the number of 
illegitimate births is noticeable in the ration of the empire 
and each particular district.

Professor Ploss declares that notwithstanding the difficulties in
three of the of the war years, congregational marriages far exceeded
legitimate births.  In over 2,000,000 children born in 1916 there
were less than 100,000 out of wedlock and among the 2,161,982
born the next year there were but 69,782 illegitimate.  These
figures, compared to the first year of the war, which witnessed
over 93,000 births out of wedlock, is a sufficient proof of improved
morality among the younger generation of Germany.[* *]
