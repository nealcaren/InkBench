Translation of Dr. A. Rhea's letter of December 20th, 1941


Dear Mrs. Cat!-

I did not reply immediately to your last letter because I wished to send you a **telegram** on the steps we have taken with our Government.

We have obtained copy of the telegram sent by Dr. Le Breton to the Argentine Minister to Washington, Or sent the **afffairs** as to our Government with the United States Legation here. In both communications it is established that the Congress is not official and that consequently the delegates cannot be official.

We are awaiting the response that our Government will make to the demand that we have made to aid us in bearing the expenses of the delegation, because the $600. which the Hote of the **Buenos** the United States sends is absolutely insufficient, as the price of the passage alone's a little less than $460. We would like to know whether each delegation is expected to bear its hotel and transportation expenses in the United States.

I hope that we shall obtain the support of the Government; we shall communicate the result to you immediately.

I urge that we may receive as soon as it is possible all publicity that you may have on the Congress, in order that the names of the other South American delegates may be published in our press.

By my next letter I will tell you whether I can go
myself to the Congress, as it is my greatest desire to do so.

I hope to see soon the pleasure of seeing you; and
in the meantime accept the expression of my best wishes.

Alicia Moreau
