Dear Douglas:

Here I am, away up in the
North West, on my first visit to my youngest
daughter, Isabella[,] the wife of H. R. Scott, who
happens to be absent, just now, in discharge
of his official duties, at "Sooyache Lake," in the
"Okanagan Country," as they call it here.  For
a year and a half, until two weeks ago, was
almost a perfect blank in my life's journey.
To be blind, is a terrible calamity to any human
being. Since the surgical operation, two months
ago, which extracted the cataract from my
left eye, and then waiting for the keenness and
sensitiveness, to light, to subside, two weeks ago
I got my new spectacles with a special glass, bat[t]ed
to my left eye, and now, with the aid of that
glass[,] I can see almost as well as ever. So much
for Cocaine and for Science. Thanks to Providence, has
man discovered and still for [oh] holding out so long. Nature has
dealt kindly with you and me. He may yet become 1776
