Dear Frederick Douglas

When we first saw yer
appointment to Hayti, and also has
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you,
we began to cheer, and think them both
the initiative of sending them all on
to you - but "w" y them. but alas!
"the hired files" of Ecclesiastical corps
they hate all this stopped - but thee
I enclose.

It was pleasant to see the
appointments which you in held,
while y are alive to use it.
I am not sure that we are glad
to have y go. We need you
here. 749
