Dear Sir

I am an Ex Union Soldier and have Endeavored to be a true patriot & politican ever since the organization of that party. I have resided in the South a greater portion of the time since the Civil War and it is my firm belief in life that there is a humble sphere in life for every one at some period of their lives. It certainly seems to me that the curse of absolute Slavery is still resting upon this Country and bears heavily upon the colored race[.] It is inside & present over the entire South.  And I am satisfied that the mass of my Race are entirely ignorant of the real situation and I also believe that a great majority of the white people of this Country do not know that Slavery is established in the Southern portion of this country.

I can assure you that I know whereof I Speak.  And if this institution is not checked soon the words of John Bunyan will be realized "That Slavery will reach both [?] the Courts of Heaven[.]

Having some past experience in that line I will give a [?summary?] of the conditions of things as they now exist and shall be more explicit as to practical workings of the system than to legal compromises by which the law is evaded.  The simplest [?] and most every day methods demonstrate most clearly the existence of an establishment to "hold acquire & sell Slaves."  In all southern states I have been in a negro is liable to be kidnapped & sold for any misdemeanor.  In others to be met on the highway, arrested on some pretext and sold to any purchaser.  If the victim can not furnish a white Lord high & mighty over him he is compelled to sign a [?[note/contract?]] binding himself to some unscrupulous influential white man to have & to hold against the service of the man during his natural life.  If for any reason he is dissatisfied situated.  Or if he is beaten, most cruelly rowed, or his wife or children insulted, there is no redress for either.  If he attempts to leave his employer without permission,ies he liable to be "branded" at the [?] caprice of any police magistrate.  In case of marriage contracts, claiming cooked victuals or "Orders."   Service demanded is in violation of all law, Human or divine if he is sick or disabled from labor either white (or [?]) he can not be benefited.

In many Southern States the elected officers are compelled to keep a number of Convicts under charges daily from the courts—these are sold to individuals or corporations at so much per month as the slave was required to simple (?)  let the contracts for the money blew by the Courts.  Many prisons are one mass of leprous (?) & dead (?) fetalise the health of slaves in nursing (or [?]) 

The Southern Politians have gone to work earnestly to [?] the spirit of liberty & the constitution as current in Texas & many other Southerns states.  The Confederacy wholly belongs to the men who hold it.  They care nothing for Governmental oversight—flag of this great nation.  The trend of events daily seems to prove—will soon justify the remark—that this "the land of the free & the birth place of the brave.
No departments of the Southern Governments now are administered by colored men.  United States Treasury clerkships excluded the Colored clerk (but as office boys).  The Southern Politians are unscrupulous in every action—here are the words of an ex Confederate in Texas. "The Colored race must return to Slavery as formerly existed in a modified form—and shall remain in that condition until they pass into other hands.

I could fill reams of the persecutions & outrages perpetrated upon the inoffensive Colored people weekly throughout the south.  I call upon all true friends (better men & statesmen) to consider this question seriously & devise some plan for the removal of the curse of caste how [?] hating on to this generation—in the meantime the negro will attempt to educate all he can in the nature of his situation—educate him to such habits of thrifts as to buy a little home as a nucleus of resistance to the demands of those who would rob him as other men have been robbed.  Land is power & power.

Yours Respectfully,
