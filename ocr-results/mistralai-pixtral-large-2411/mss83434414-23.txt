## FREEDMEN'S BUREAU.

The friends of the freedman claim for him a weight of intellectual brain equal to his white brother.  A number of the more intelligent freedmen increased in the care of the opportunities offered, inventing doing things, and it is contemplated to send those from this section, as well as others, many interesting statistics will be added to the archives of the bureau.

The officers of the medical staff in charge of the districts are entitled to great credit for often-times rendering seriously ill men fit to resume using work in so short a time as twenty-one days.  They were given the subordinates sick during the war.  The practice and the cordial cooperation always given by the Assistant Surgeon of the Provost Marshal's Corps and the officers of the other staff departments has relieved embarrassment and encouraged me in my official course.

In concluding this report I beg leave, gratefully to acknowledge the facilities at all times afforded by the Commissioner to the medical branch of the bureau.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Caleb W. Horner
Surgeon United States Volunteers. Chief Medical Officer.

The breaking up of the old plantation system has necessarily left the sick with little or no medical provision except that existing among the freedmen themselves.  As soon as they earn money and become better versed than now in the ordinary means of self-support; they will doubtless secure the necessary aid.

The medical officers of this bureau at the best can afford but partial relief.

## MISCELLANEOUS.

**Of justice.—**As all matters relating to refugees and freedmen were committed to my supervision and management by the law, and as the old civil codes in the several insurrectionary States had become practically null and void so far as they related to the negro, it became necessary to lay down some general rule for the officers of the bureau concerning the administration of justice.  At first I confined myself to the following instructions:

VI.  Simple good faith, for which we hope on all hands from those concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve the Assistant Commissioners in the discharge of their duties towards the freedmen, as well as promote their general welfare.  The Assistant Commissioners will, everywhere, declare and protect their freedom, as set forth in the proclamation of the President and laws of Congress.

VII.  In all places where there is an interruption of civil law, or in which local courts, by reason of old codes, in violation of the freedom guaranteed by the proclamation of the President and the laws of Congress, disregard the negro’s right to justice before the laws to not allowing him to give testimony, the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen being committed to this bureau, the Assistant Commissioners will adjudicate, either themselves or through officers of their appointment, all difficulties arising between negroes themselves or between negroes and whites or Indians, except those in military service, so far as recognizable by military authority, and not taken cognizance of by the other tribunals, civil or military, of the United States.

The latter paragraph is based on the reference of freedmen’s cases to provost and freedmen’s courts.

The provost courts were established generally by the department commanders, and cases passed through him to revision.  In the great majority of instances that have come to my knowledge these courts have decided fairly, but there are some exceptions, where officers, composing them, having the sectional prejudice against the negro, have discriminated by which after his interest, and reported out to those who abused him, either by extortion or violence, punishments in no way commiserate with the offenses.

The freedmen’s courts have been constituted wholly or partially of officers of the bureau.  It was impossible to multiply such courts, on account of the scarcity of officers.  Therefore, residual practice of associating civilians with these officers for the settlement of minor cases, and with limited powers as justice of the peace.
