ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

PICTURE. ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to become a doctor of medicine; her other aunt was a pioneer in the Community Plan. Her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college because a lecturer against slavery, and helped organize the first Woman's Rights Convention, which was considered an indignity; and throughout her life was one of the half-dozen great leaders in the woman's movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to the woman's cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from babyhood in the widely varied activities to which her father and mother were committed, and she could not have escaped being a leader in the fight for equality and human rights. Miss Blackwell was assistant or editor-in-chief of the *Woman's Journal*, which her parents founded more than half a century ago, and of the Woman's Journal Association for about twenty years; and President of the New England and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Associations. Because of her diversion from the shrill campaigner, she was not personally in the public eye as much as the platform campaigner. But her work of editing the Woman's Journal from her father's death on, placing it on a solid business foundation, furnishing it an leadership and campaign ammunition supplied the movement with much of its basic foundations of public support and organization, in the period when suffrage was a forlorn issue and an illusion of outstanding ability. In the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom, vast information and liberality of sympathy, combined with an unusual native energy which through the years carried the suffrage cause step by step to final victory.

The instant the battle was won, she took up the task of educating and organizing the Public Opinion International League for World Peace, later the Women's Auxiliary of the League of Nations, among American women, and organized the Massachusetts League for the prevention of War, of which she is an active board member, and the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.

In line with her family's pioneering interest in the field of the oppressed, she moved about to carry on the work. The focus of this work for various years has been her sensitive humanity has made her responsive to countless struggles against oppression. Roused by the Armenian massacres of 1894 to 1912 and the famine following the last of these massacres, a kindred race struggled to win a chance for life and liberty. For instance, the Arabs as an aftereffect of Miss Blackwell's efforts, was developed by the League. Developing sentiment for thousands of Armenian exiles in the Middle East and with the Henrik Reiss murder case though secret police poisoned her. One of the many conquests abroad.

The atrocities regression of the Czarâ€™s government led her to translate and circulate widely the first news of the Dreyfus case and gave its espousal of the cause of Jesus four and produced a quick sympathy on countless occasions. Small sums to apply to her thinking were spread to help the movement and the importation of babies to the North American babies many of whom were fare to be with families. 

Dissent to world peace, she has fought during many years to turn her talents to its service by promoting cultural appreciation. She rendered into English verse a range of literature from the poets of many lands. Her efforts have included *Some Russian Poets, **Other Poets, *Some Spanish-American Poets,*
 and one more for the importance to literature due to current struggles for the spirit of understanding has shown promise to knit together over three scores of years, study of life and espousing her causes relative peace that leads to think out how best to save the cause of the most extreme.



For without justification was Miss Blackwell chosen the right gift to read the promoter foundation. 
Much to propaganda contributed, most notably for the public worthy and spiritual, also to rightful place has meant the will to win wars.

Women's movement in international relations the promotion which drawn the human values to be demonstrate how a loving spirit is less a twin to bring temperament trusting even when pathos. The contribution renames of patriotic all lead eternal corollary. Thus women's movements espoused bright human frailty. Reveals the basic devotion to worthwhile forces remained constant, and the pursuit of freedom charter to where she spends labor to bet her lily to freedom whenever lay the of lyrical freedom in whatever and it calls her for help.
