An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, one of the pioneers among the women workers in the suffrage movement. In this respect, Miss Blackwell is an illustrious member of the third generation of women who have devoted their lives to the work of obtaining equal rights for women. One of Miss Blackwell's aunt, Elizabeth Blackwell, was the first woman physician in America, and Elizabeth's sister, Antoinette Brown Blackwell—we have here three women whose physical energies were controlled by three outstanding moral forces—human liberty, intellectual improvement, and spiritual vitality.

Blackwell was the first to be ordained a minister; Miss Blackwell was the first woman to be admitted to college, and Lucy Stone was one of the first women in the United States to be graduated from Boston University and teach school, and the first woman in the United States to retain her own name after marriage. From this strain of revolutionizing the conditions of women's lives, and in publishing the "Woman's Journal", carrying this paper on alone after their death until the control passed into their son's hands, she never stopped working for the cause until 1917, when it became the "Woman Citizen", and now it has been for 25 years the organ of the Woman's Suffrage Association, of which Miss Blackwell has served as secretary for nearly 20 years.

She has been engaged in many activities as member of the National American Suffrage Association, and Trustee of Boston Public Library, a member of the Massachusetts branch of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, Hebrew poet and the cause of the Armenians. She has rendered into English a volume of Armenian poems, as well as one of Russian poems. A volume of her own verse, edited and published by her friend Mrs. Julia Ward Howe. Her biography of her mother, “Lucy Stone”.” This was at one time one of the “Ten best books of the year.”
