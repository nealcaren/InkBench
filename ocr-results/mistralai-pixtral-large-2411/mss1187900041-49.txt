Washington D.C.
April 13th 1869

Dear Father,

Your reply to my letter was
received yesterday.
From what you said in your letter to
Lewis I feared that you supposed I was
discharged for neglect of duty or from some such
cause, but such was not the case.
Gen. Howard did not know at first that
I was among the number, and he wrote
as stated to me afterwards that had he
been a member of the Law Class wants
have been retained. The following is the
truth.

Mr. Langston has taken charge of the
Law Department of the Howard University
and has about twenty colored students.
