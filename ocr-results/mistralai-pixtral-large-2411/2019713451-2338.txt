Give Special Heed to these Directions.
This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions are for gratuited copies; those given on the cover of No. 1 have been studied and followed. In this number, a few more of the first four principles are reviewed, and the stem letters, t, d, p, q, are introduced.

The Contractions used are as follows: — m. l, Main Line; c. l, Connecting Line; m. a., Main Line Slope; c. s., Connecting Slope; m., Modified; p., Parallel; P., Printed and Running Letters.

The Diagram on the cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths. The Diagram above the copy, the part made at each Count, the Principles, and the way the copy is to be placed in the lines.

SUGGESTIONS. 1. The only possible way of teaching Penmanship successfully in a school, is to have all the scholars of the class write the same lines in the same book at the same time.

2. The order of instruction is KNOWLEDGE, EXECUTION, CRITICISM.

First, KNOWLEDGE. Explain the copy carefully, and have it analysed into its Principles and then into its Elements. Teach the nature, peculiarity, slope, beginning and ending of each element; notice the contractions that give the principles, and the connecting lines as seen in the lines of a common book. This explanation of preventable lines is to be accompanied by a like examination of the writing in the Scholar’s book.

Second, EXECUTION. Let them first trace the copy with dry pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing the pupils to be very careful as to position, penholding, rests, and movements, which are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should be high enough from the desk to allow a holder to be passed under it.

Observe Carefully every line, as the copy is written, by asking questions on each particular part shown in the Diagram (which are more readily answered by the class by inspection alone), and

1. ANALYZE at first every example of a principle from the patterns on the cover. Let one, as a manual, write at the bl. etc., "straight or broad oval."  2. SEE. See each example from the oval and connecting lines, notice the mistakes in room & order posited and tell how each should be corrected. This, having the attention directed to the principles alone, will render the work both easier & pleasanter. — Every pupil should have his own copybook, and they should be encouraged to take pride in making their work beautiful.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES.

COPY 1. KNOWLEDGE. The 1’s and 2’s are o.l., respectively. The top of 1, is a little more than half across it the box. Mind the slope of 2's and the distance between them. Observe Rules 1, 2, 5, 7.

Execution. P. 1 from Diag. on cover. All 2’s have been fully explained in No. 1. Practice, see. The movement is P., (F l.) & E. 2, 3, 3, 4, 5.

COPY 2. KNOWLEDGE. "The T in this copy is made first," (Observe the top and bottom of the lines). Every t has a short straight upright from base line. Mind broad & m. l. for top, n. l. for foot, & m. for curve. Care should be taken to make cross bar. Practice, see.

Execution. Trace the copy a few times, by count, giving special attention to Position, Penholding, Rests, and Movements. Next, have one column of t written by count. Thus: "Ready?" (which means place the pen over, but not on the spot they are to start from.) 1, 2, " 1", 2, "1."

CRITICISM. Ask questions on all the particulars known by the pupil. Questions, see.

COPY 3. KNOWLEDGE. "I have many beginnings to make now." 1. "How many made of t?" How many made of f ?  "Now many more than the left curve of the oval ? How many angles in m /"  How many made of this second form, etc. see angle of t, kle, of m i, m l and observed these questions and others asked as per directions for copy 1 and attention should be given to special directions already observed.

POSITION, PENHOLDING, RESTS, AND MOVEMENTS. These are fully explained in the Manual and the direction so followed in the accompanying diagrams. The forms written & illustrating beginners for page P and sir, k and L.d. p. into these directions. If a longhorn pen like black G Sou e f is used; & when the  pen holders that follow these directions are used, which are shown in the accompanying diagram, advantage will be taken of these special instructions & drawing. The diagrams for B.S.c pilot, a. A.d, pi is formanent: which assistance, diagrams and next to a teacher with correct ideas of drawing and executive ability with pupils placed under his careful instruction. The short form and long form pen holders show the direct course or keep the lines as per instructions.
