A speech made at a *Mass Meeting* in
Memorial Hall Cleveland, April 13, 1921

impromptu speech substituted for
Scheduled one on Politics

There is not an audience in this country nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the hearts of the people. There is not an audience before which a speaker may dare to international peace that does not respond. There is not anyone in all the world who is willing to speak, in my judgment, who does not want another war. There is no embodied group to say it cannot be brought about, but how are we going to get it, that is the important question, and it is not only before us to decide in our own country, in our own states, and cities, but it is for ourselves individually and to think our way through.

We don't settle that question when we learn a million different points of view, but speak, wait for somebody to act.

Everybody at this time is extremely careful about being non-partisan. I am for everything of that kind, but not waiting too long. It does not matter what party I am to be, it is a nation. 

Today there isn't anybody in the world knows what we are going to do; nobody in any other nation knows to do; but I ask you if there is anybody, anybody in this nation and nobody in the world. What are we going to do with an earnest crusading spirit who is campaigning to make America to lead in the nation to do. We are the people to do that and we have with with that is the greatest and strongest questions which never presented to the nations of the world.

It is a curious kind of psychology that is upon our nation. We have always been a nation in favor of ambition. It was this country, I believe, which had the foresight, we didn't believe in that nation. We are believers in the idea of engaging in war is nation. We are a peaceful people, relying questions and not forced. Well, then, we are the appointed ones to lead in this question.
