My dear Miss Catt:

I am in
the General Hospital, Osteopathic unit #750 - at Los Angeles, about thirty-
present with a fractured leg.  I
have been here 8 weeks today.
I hope soon to be released from
this terrible house of torture, a
cast, so that I can return
to my little apartment at
609 Fairview Place, S. W. Pasadena
Calif. Many friends, wonderful
to me in all ways.
An address may close
friend Mrs. Grace Gaushlb.
Oak St., So. Pasadena who has
all - of me in charge.

Cordially
