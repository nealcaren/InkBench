that all thoughtful people, all the time, of Ohio, of whom so few who have the good of the African race at heart - will agree with me in the hearty philosophy and variant view I have taken of the subject - will (?) go with us further in pamphlet form?  If so, I shall order some for circulation. This is not a kind of thought - in it that it would take a change in any report.  Again I beg to thank you for laying before the American people so forcibly and briefly an address which your absence and a cry to our common friend [Lydians?] McDonald hopefully makes necessary in Ohio. He is the old abolitionist all through and through whom life - and please have him mark one - to whom he will know from whom to receive it.  I remain rather in this day and night to thank you for being with us all the way from your house to my house.  I do what I can to restore it. For the I pray & for the I ask at home. I hope you have not given all plane secondary publicity.

Faithfully yours,
