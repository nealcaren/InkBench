if you will but keep
the eye of your own
Spirit turned within -
for it is there (within
[~~but within~~)] that that
the precious jewel of
truth & bright is to
be sought; & found -
And darling - It
will find it, & take
it, and flux it - and
all men & women will
call you blessed -
lasting but oh so dear
