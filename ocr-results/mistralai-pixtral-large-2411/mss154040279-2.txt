My dear Mrs. Catt:

Permit me to congratulate you sincerely upon the award of the Pictorial Review prize. Few who have received it have ever deserved it more and I am delighted that work so important as yours has been recognized by this group. It has been recognized by everyone else I know, but we are always proud when one more group notices it.

Very sincerely yours,

[Signature: Frances Perkins]
