The Smith sisters of Glastonbury have lately parted with a share of brick stock and with two pet Aberdeens, rather than pay their taxes in the regular way, in our own mint depreciated currency. Cousins Peter Foster, Stephen S—and Abby Kelly, who have been refusing to pay their taxes for several years, because Abby was not allowed to vote, have clearly got sick of the martyr business. And no wonder, for it was rather expensive, and the public has been more inclined to poke fun at, than to sympathize with, the “sufferers.” The Worcester authorities have treated the Foster couple with great forbearance—recognizing that, owing to rather muddled ideas of the theory of taxation, they really believed they were vindicating a principle in refusing payment. The fallacy of their position, as the Times has often shown, rests upon the entirely mistaken notion that taxation is connected with the right of suffrage or any way dependent on it. The world was taxed six thousand years before suffrage was invented, and the citizens of countries where suffrage does not exist are taxed to day without a thought of protest. Minors are taxed, and paupers are taxed, and universally, in the theory and practice of civilized and uncivilized governments, taxation is recognized as the fair contribution of the citizen to the expenses of the government whose protection and conveniences he enjoys. Not to pay taxes is a wickedly selfish principle of the dark ages of human history.
