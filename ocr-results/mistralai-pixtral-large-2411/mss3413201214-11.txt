Dear Journal Friends,

There is to be a suffrage festival here Nov 14 and 15 and we are to have a Woman's Journal booth.  Can you send me any decorations and a large card to have some "Newsie" boys - and I have about 50 subscription blanks.  I've never done anything of this sort and have little idea how to go about it.  But Mr. Murcham${}^{t}$on who is getting up the festival telephoned this morning that Alice Paul had sent her word she would not pay the cost of creating a booth for the Suffragist and other Dr. Mez N. had offered to pay the costs of erecting the booth she would like it to be used for the Journal the paper she preferred to help- I promised to seeMrâ€”
