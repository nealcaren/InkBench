### THE REGISTER ANDER WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 24, 1916

#### When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage

In the Legislative session of 1867, called all over the state through brutal suppression of democratic legislatures, of Gov. Morton refused to enforce the constitution. The great officer of the law was guilty of acts of open rebellion and organized treason. In high places his representative helped to manipulate fraudulent elections and transgress every sacred obligation guaranteed by the national constitution, with open repudiation of the federal troops, still encamped in menacing authority.

In this session John H. Reagan joined his power of smart civil judgement to the earnest and sincere efforts of Gov. Brownlow and other sincere statesmen, in obedience to the national behest then and there promulgated, and faithful to the wisdom and fulfillment of Presidential decree, the Glad God-seeking human souls incarnate, made as living souls who breathe the breath of life turn once more to the fellowship of glorious government.

Women were stunned by the sudden grasp circumstances presented and why should not women be permitted to share the right to protect themselves and the rights invested in her maternal wombs. In the fourteen sessions of the Legislature after the constitutional amendment of 1870 women remained down where human intellect denied her right to share as a free human soul the right of suffrage, which, by the arbitrary power of men and things, she had been deprived.

It required men endowed with spirit and the comprehension of the ineffable to grant this hard postoity. [?] The James P. Irish along over that period was but a meager but recognized part, and who know who know may differ may from military apprehension, but who know may divine the thoughts that inspired the sacrifices that secured this statutory equipment to women.

In proportion to the volume of history apportioned to each member, Senators Irish sparsely mentioned the favoring thought story.

From my personal observation as a young member of the senatorial or legislator branch and occasional little services granted, I am permit privileged to know that Senator Irish shared the spirit of intelligent civilization in culminating the people of the sovereign rights of men and women in the fulfillment of this purpose.

Who would dare dispute the spirit of tranquil equity, that in succeeding sessions fill the senatorial chair, in special executive compartments of greatest interest, could have but know the immът of the occasion that inspired the steady pursuit of consecrated patriotic, manhood and womanhood?

In 1897 at the adjourned session of Tennessee Legislature convened at Knoxville at which I was an exalted spectator, I heard Senator Irish in memorable excuses flushed with distinguished approbation, who proposed to expurgate provisions from the statute books where old thiddle handled by old fogey legislative amendments should be removed because in derogation of existing spirit purified constitutions and administrations.

Subsequently the Federal Courts enlarged lumiere of ancient rights, and I remember how the bountiful charities of Senatorial times has exalted him in my heart forever, and I now see the prophecy:
When John P. Irish spoke for the unmolested seals of the women's rights of Tennessee, and who can say when immemorial solemities.

There was but treasure harrowed, in the presence of still grievous assaults, which he knew and discerned. It was thus he spoke in words of halting, devoid of staleness, in explanation of why:

### WHY IRISH FAVORED SUFFRAGE

'I believe that a woman is as much entitled to the exercise of the elective franchise as any man, and should not be deprived of it alone, any more so than the colored man'.  Why should a man who elect[s] upon the responsibilities of maintaining religion to have to tie his insentients and all in supreme regulation or domestic life the same as a supporter of a common dual obligation. That breath has been relegated to squalid places where she ought to be in an equalized status, only being on account of chivalrous obligations, should have been from the beginning of the immemorial government.

#### MR. IRISH GOING OLD
