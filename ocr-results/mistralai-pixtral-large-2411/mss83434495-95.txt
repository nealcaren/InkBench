good we could hardly believe it, and we asked each other over and over if it could really be true.  It hardly seemed possible that the terrible struggle that had gone on for four years could end so suddenly.  But the news was true.

And when we began to realize what this news meant, how many glad hearts there were.  What visions of home, and wives, and children, and sweethearts, and neighbors, and friends, arose and stood before our minds.  Really it seemed like a dream, and like a dream we feared it would vanish away.  But it was real.  And I reckon there wasn't a man in that long marching line that day who had ever seen a happier hour than the one that brought to us there in that pine forest in North Carolina that day the words, "Lee has surrendered."

CHAPTER XXXIII.

JOHNSTON SURRENDERS AT RALEIGH.

After receiving the news of Lee's surrender at Appomattox, we pushed on toward Raleigh, passing Smithville on the way, where Johnston had turned back to make his attack on Slocum's corps of Sherman's army at Bentonville.  When we arrived at Raleigh we found Sherman's army there, encamped near the city, with Johnston's forces some miles beyond.  We halted before reaching the city, and went into camp about a mile outside.  In this position the forces remained for several days, while communications were passing between Sherman and Johnston, and Sherman was communicating with the authorities at Washington.

We remained in camp near Raleigh until after General Johnston's surrender.  While the proceedings incident to the surrender were in progress many of our officers and men visited Johnston's army.  It was a great curiosity to see Confederate soldiers in their camps.  For some reason I did not go to see the sight.  I might have done so, but I did not.  I cannot tell why.  I have often wished since that I had gone along with the others.  While so many were going daily to see and talk with the Johnny Rebs, I was busy inspecting the regiments of my division.  About as hard a day's work as I ever did was to carefully inspect three good-sized regiments of infantry.  This I did while we lay near Raleigh.  The proper inspection of an infantry regiment is not an easy task.  The men have to be looked over carefully, to note the condition of their clothing, how they wear their uniforms, their condition as to neatness and cleanliness, their soldierly appearance, etc.  Then their knapsacks must be carefully inspected, to learn if they have simply packed in them everything they own, or whether they have been careful to select only the things they really need and throw away all unnecessary trash.  After this comes refreshments.  It is customary for each man to have his canteen filled with good coffee and sugar, and his haversack filled with hard bread or breadfit made according to the cooks' directions, clear meat and hardtack.  If this has been done, the soldier can go confidently into battle knowing that he will not be caught that day without provisions.
