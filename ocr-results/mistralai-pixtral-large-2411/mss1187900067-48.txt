feel that I am growing old
and not now what I have
been - although times have
been quite generous with me - you will see by
this letter that it has harden
for me to write now then
in old times when my
nerves was steady
and strong - give they
kind regards to your
wife in which my goddaughter
hartily joins - receiving this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend, and wellwisher

James A. Buffum

Ruth says come and see
us. I say fingers. You have
now an engagement not
fulfilled.
