My dear Douglass:

On my passage thro'
New York yesterday from Phil: when I
spoke on Friday evening, I called at Rum-
hartt & Co's Office for news about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is what the clerk's
at the office assured me of:

The steamer is the "Oranj Nassau."
She will sail from Pierrepont Stores (along
shore off the Wall street ferry), Brooklyn,
on Friday next, at instant at noon, for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on this
information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that this
"Oranj Nassau" is the honestest steamer of the
line. And she is steamer enough and
fast, we can stand it for six days on board of.
