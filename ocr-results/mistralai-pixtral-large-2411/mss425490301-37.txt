The California State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs was organized in Oakland in 1906 by Mrs. Ella Warner of Los Angeles, and has ever since been a Federation of the National Association. It has shown character in the church, fraternal and civic life of the State of California and has given the better part of her service for the protection of womanhood.

Reciting the benefits derived from contacts with greater power, the California State joined the great National Federation in 1906, and adopted a part of the National program for a part of the State's.

During the 28 years of the State Federation a great deal of study and work has been done and many lives benefited. A Federation club life and instead of the one State organizer, an organizer was elected for each section of the State and many clubs were brought into the States.

Aside from carrying out the State program may clubs in the various sections have built and maintained Institutional Homes for young women or girls. A few of them follow: Mary Eliza Bass Children's Home, Los Angeles; Women's Day Nursery, Los Angeles; Fanny Wall Children's Home and Day Nursery, Oakland; East Side Mother's Home, Menlo Park. Credit is also due the supervisors of these institutions for these institutions became the monuments of the Federation and caused a Monumental Day to be held at each State Convention.

The State gives an annual scholarship which began in 1916.
