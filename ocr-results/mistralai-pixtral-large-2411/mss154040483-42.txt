The full report of the action of that committee has not now been given out. This information is slowly, carefully, consideration was given to the draft convention which, after much discussion, solidified, with four amendments, was formally agreed upon. Full appreciation for our American representative, Miss Grace Abscott, was amply shown.

The subject of licensing is important, and the discussion was so circumspect that a process of examination of those who will operate brothels or workers in connection with this trade goes into every background.

The Philippine Commonwealth Act was renewed. It is expected that legislation in our centers will still be kept and that the traffic in persons will be watched.

### Your Investments

By Eleanor Kerr

**TWO** policies issued by insurance companies which are very popular and very satisfactory to the policyholders of the document order mentioned in our last article are income bonds and retirement annuities.

Many women—and men, too, of course—who have no one dependent on them—who want to provide themselves and have nobody to leave their savings income in the future, find the purchase of income bonds one of the safest means. The insurance company makes annual payments until a certain age, after which, during the insurance company that was said that the deposits for the rest of her life. Should she die before reaching this age, the insurance spokeswoman voices to return to the heirs that the whole money was deposited, and even morning purchase they after having celebrated forty years old might share some of the income payments, but not the aggregate equal to the entire amount paid in, which in this broad income is usually returned to the heirs.

The cost of income bonds varies as to the age of the woman which payment on them begins, and the age at which the income is desired. A person of sixty of age, who wishes to have an income to begin within a year at 65, and a $41 a month would pay an annual premium of about $240, and the policy generally provides for additional payments only if the policyholder lives at the time they happen to begin at the age after their mortgage. Disregarding the fact that interest is paid to the end of their mortality years, the interest we look forward after their interest might be a more moderate rate of about 3 ¾ per cent on the accumulated deposits in the last 200 years, and the former rate, in the profit to the company as well as in the ottoman income. Insurance annuities, companies are accumulating during the twenty or thirty years often is not paid out, then a rate is supplied by far on their mortality table in the time of purchased life of the ordinary mortality table after the savings come into play in the insurance returns. They purchased into the rate of 0.5 to 2 per cent the more ordinary capitalism on the life will have served on the money spent on the whole life of accumulated funds deposited over the years past. Thus the higher compound for the computation of annuities is also used to the retirement annuities.

The single paying for the premium and is generally the lifetime benefit of 5 per cent over $50, and the single premium annuity would thus possibly return at the age 65, giving of $13.50 a month for life beginning a thirty unit. The rate also providing life annuity assets for the sum asked are 105 annuities. The company of them are limited at the age of 65, and of at the lower mortality and purchase having been paid on the income paid. One rightly gives particularly the same principle of 5 per cent a year. This would be applied to the premium the expiration of the beneficiaries and evenuse in mind that who cannot spend payment beginning at the age of 50 paid. In retirement cases and get for food on the age of sixty, and a return of $15 a month towards the current from whose retirement of life $16.71 a month.
