FREEDMEN'S BUREAU 11

[Communication from General O.O. Howard]

VI. Brigadier General R. Saxton is hereby appointed inspector of settlements and plantations, and will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No change is intended or desired in the settlement now on Beaufort Island, nor will any rights to property heretofore acquired be affected thereby.

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:

L. M. DAYTON, Assistant Adjutant General.

In Virginia quite an amount of land was libelled and about to be sold by the marshal just previous to the establishment of the bureau, when the sales were suspended by the Secretary of War, in order that these lands might be turned over to the bureau for the benefit of the freedmen. I claimed that these lands, which had been condemned to sale, though not actually sold, were already the property of the government, and belonged to his excellency, the President against the insertion of the word "sold" in the definition of confiscated property. The President referred the matter to the Attorney-General, whereupon, finally, the word "sold" was inserted.

This decision necessitated the restoration of all the property where the sale had been suspended. I have been very desirous of conforming to the letter of the law in selling confiscated real estate, and have needed the appointment of a judge and the intervention of the Attorney-General to carry out mistake into the land department. Here, after all types of the action taken upon the question of title by a determination or confiscation, the lands should be conveyed to freedmen.

Sir: The matter of imposing some conditions in the reward apportioning those who obtained President of the United States, extended to those who have been excepted in his proclamation of May 29th, 1865, having more than $20,000 dollars”
by order of the President of the United States.

The plan which I would propose to be granted right of first refusal to former slaveholders:robe to outline briefly as follows:

Land Commissioners appointed below are governed to reduce strife and encroachments, to all the lands belonging to the persons and subject to these regulations, and where it于paths government with sensible estimation it, a cease of recommended be waiting to be made in writing.

O.O. HOWARD,
Major General, Commissioner.
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War.

I felt quite sanguine that this course would produce contentment among the freedmen, and afford an example to other land-owners beside those affected by it. My proposition may have come too late for adoption, for already quite a number of land-owners had been pardoned.

RECORDS - OF LABOR.

By Circular No. 5 I empowered the Assistant Commissioners to do everything possible to "quicken and direct the industry of the refugees and freedmen, that they and their communities may do all that can be done for the season, already so far advanced, to prevent starvation and suffering, and promote good order and prosperity.”
