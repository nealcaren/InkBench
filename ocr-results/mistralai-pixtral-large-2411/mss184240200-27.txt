I knew a good deal when
I heard it!!! I won't take
his favor when it is about,
with, or prefer mine when
I have the same objection to give
as he.

I don't know why you
waited to see that scrap
of a letter from my western
friend but I enclose a
copy.

All going
again.

With heartiest
regards to your health
especially if you think of
leaving the rigor of a
New England summer next
July -
