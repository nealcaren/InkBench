Note: Certain abbreviations and symbols are transcribed as they appear in the document. Any illegible sections such as for "Co." are noted with [?] and sections that were left out from an ordered entry sequence are maintained in their original transcription (e.g., duplicate serial number such as 738 is transcribed as it appears on the document). Some insignificant strikethroughs within the original are ignored. The formatting splitting different sections has not been strictly replicated here. Any entries that were manual notes aren't included unless they transcribe significant original text data.
