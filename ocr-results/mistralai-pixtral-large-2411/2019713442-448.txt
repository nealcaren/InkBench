Notes:
- Italicized text that looks handwritten has been preserved as marginalia.
- The ampersand (&) symbol has been transcribed as such.
- Exact spelling, grammar, and punctuation, were preserved as they appear in the image, including the use of quotation marks around the phrase "dough-faced."
- Illegible text was not an issue in this instance. 
- The "ยง" was not transcribed as it was not fully visible and this was primarily for emphasis.

The text is as observed and transcribed according to the guidelines.
