Papa & Mama:

Yesterday we went 
on a pleasant picnic to
Titch Bay. It was an
all-day trip. We had an
early breakfast, & then the
Holbrooks came over, &
we all piled into a little
steam-launch, chartered
for the occasion. It
carries 25, & there were 20
of us. The engine divides
it in the middle, with
wood heaped up on each
side (fancy a steam engine
fire by wood:) & very loud,
was pretty too, this little vessel. Then Sadie is
againется ипl еН год we am well.
