# EMANCIPATION AND COLONIZATION.

The city of Cárden has about 5,000 inhabitants; its aspect from the port is very picturesque and beautiful. Mariners, on their entering, may be guided by a fine fixed light in the Indian village opposite the place, which light can be seen fourteen miles at sea. The principal commerce of this town consists in the extraction of logwood, the annual exportation of which is from four to six hundred thousand quintals. This price generally ranges from 75 cents to $1 25, according to the demand, or the increased supply in the markets.

The logwood is carried to Cárden in canoes of from four hundred to a thousand quintals burden, from Tabasco, Chiapa, Candelaria, Chuntaun, the Ranchos of the East, Palizada, and principally from all the ranchos on the river Uxamacinta, passing through Palizeda. The interior of the country is generally swampy; and its greatest production to this day is logwood. There is also in the interior of the country, a large quantity of cedar, mahogany, and divers other kinds of fine and valuable timber, especially for ship-building; but, until now, they have not been an object of great extraction or exportation.

There are at present ten or twelve establishments for the elaboration of sugar and coffee (sugar-cane rum,) and with time these articles may be produced in abundance for exportation.

What is now considered as the territory of Cárden has about 20,000 inhabitants.

If the country was more thickly peopled, so as to facilitate labor for agricultural pursuits, it would probably be one of the richest tracts of country in the world.

Steam communications could be established from Cárden to the rivers of Palizada, Chuntaun, Candelaria, Mamante, and Cánó de Tabasco, by deepening a little the bars of these rivers, which could be done without any great outlay, and with lucrative results to any one who would undertake the enterprise.

The distance by sea from Vera Cruz to Laguna is two hundred and seventy miles; from Laguna to Frontera de Tabasco, by sea, forty-eight miles; or to San Juan Bautistia one hundred and fourteen miles by sea and river.

Of the 584,810 quintals of logwood exported from Laguna in 1856, but 36,859 quintals went to the United States.

The state of Yucatán contains 47,253 square miles, just the area of Pennsylvania. Sitzee, in his Memoria, published in 1857, gives Right’s computation of the inhabitants in 1855 as 668,623: cities, 5; incorporated towns, 7; haciendas 1,316; ranches 2,629.

M. Gilbert, an intelligent traveler who visited Yucatán in 1861, estimated the population at 500,000.

Yucatán was, under Spain, a captain generality, distinct from the vice-royalty of Mexico; it was called the Intendancy of Mérida.

Hemboldt, in his New Spain, vol. 2, p. 244, writes of the intendancy of Mérida, in 1808, as follows:
