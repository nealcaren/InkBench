Mrs. Inez Haynes Irwin,
240 West 11th Street
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mrs. Irwin:

In reply to your circular letter, I am obliged to say that I am unable to help anywhere along the lines you say, being one of the women who are not *indisposed* to give material help, but who frankly can't.

I am unable, too, to offer to sell books to strangers or to help with committees. I cannot contribute and I cannot send names of wealthy women who might be interested.

I do not believe that the archives can be made possible by small contributions of many members. An endowment of considerable size is required to make it possible.  I do not feel so much enthusiasm for it as I would in the possibility of securing that endowment was more promising.

I am troubled over myself over the problem of what to do with the things I have which belong in such archives at provided the venture does not materialize in time to receive them.

Very sincerely yours,

Carrie Chapman Catt
