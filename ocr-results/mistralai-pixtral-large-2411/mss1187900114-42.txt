Honorable Frederick Douglass,
Commissioner,
Haytian Pavilion,
Jackson Park.

Dear Sir:--

I have the honor to advise you of the completion of plans for a series of practical talks, limited to thirty minutes each, by practical men upon practical topics, connected with the subjects of Forestry, Agriculture and Live Stock, the lectures, or talks, to begin about June 20th with Forestry and continue daily throughout the Exposition. They will be given in the Assembly Hall, erected for this purpose, in connection with the Agricultural Building.

It is the earnest desire of the Department to have these talks international in scope, and far reaching in good results to all interested in the great industries to be covered.

Will you do me the honor, and assist me greatly, by sending me the names of such members of your Commission, or prominent men
