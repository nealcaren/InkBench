### MEMORIAL SET UP TO DR. EMILY LEWI

Friends of the late Dr. Emily Lewi presented a check for $14,000 yesterday to the Society of New York Infirmary to start an endowment fund in her memory.

Income will be used for the care of indigent women patients and children with the infirmary and their children.

The check was presented to Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlipp, president of the infirmary, by Mr. Cyril Spoffer Manter, medical director of the infirmary, at a brief ceremony at a meeting of the trustees in the Fuller Building, 507 Madison Ave.

Mrs. Vanderlipp said of Dr. Lewi: “She was one of the oldest doctors who had been an active member of the infirmary and the Before consummation as the alive women in a time of training and service by women doctors. Without her work and that of her associates, Sloane Hospital would long since have closed its doors.”

Dr. Lewi, who died two years ago, was a pediatrician who practiced for many years. She also served as director of pediatrics at Sloane Hospital.

She was known as an outstanding teacher and diagnostician and was one of the pioneers in endocrinology.

One room in the projected new infirmary building on East 15th St. will be known as the Emily Lewi Memorial Room and the endowment will support it.
