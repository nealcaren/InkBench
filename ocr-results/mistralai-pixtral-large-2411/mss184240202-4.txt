Carry her out of life at
once. The first letter I
had from him here gave
me coherent & sufficient
proof that nurse was proving
incompetent, - though I can't
reconcile it with her apparent
efficiency at 1601. However

immediately conscious that
a proper attendant must
be secured before long.  Coz.
Mary writes me that Lizzie
Lee is not to be had, & has
not health enough for the
place if she were.  I shall

write Sallie T. Love f."th Trustees
that Lord had better do
nursing at $2.00 per week
until we can some profit
