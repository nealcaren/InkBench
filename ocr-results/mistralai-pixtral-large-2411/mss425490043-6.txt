no difficulty in choosing your subject
the luncheon takes place at 1:15 clock PM
and the length of time devoted to ad-
dresses is about not [**more**] than five minutes
at most

Please let me have a brief sketch
which we may use for publication in
our newspapers relative to yourself
and your public work. We would like
to have this by Thursday AM to the coming
week so it can be included in League
notes for next week.

Mrs. Evans and I shall be very much
pleased to have you as our guest
while in our city.
