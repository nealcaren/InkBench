Illegible writing (possibly in a different language):

[*unreadable*]

[*scribbled signature*]

[*scribbled text*]

Russian text at the bottom:
```
РОССIЯ
ПЕРМСKАЯ ПОББДА
```

Marginalia:
- The top left corner has some scribbled text that is mostly illegible: "notez.fe.right" and "since no Ilme" (this appears to be random notes or perhaps practice writing).
- There is a faint fold line across the length and middle of the document, suggesting it was folded multiple times.
  
This document appears to be a historical baptism record from a Nordic region, given the context and language used and seems to have been registered/validated in Russia. The exact year and other details could not be accurately deciphered from the image. The writing is not fully legible in several areas.
