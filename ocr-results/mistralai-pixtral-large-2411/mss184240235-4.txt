My dear Miss Dickman -

Has your throat been troubling you this Winter?  When will you give us the benefit of your school but she?  I want very much to hear you in some of your latest songs, and in any instance to renew my acquaintance with the ineluctable, in Whose care I am always apprehending that the political skin is one political sin com.

Your last bright consummate charm is not so stimulating as your opinions words are the true joys of intercession in the previous goodbye!  This lonely little clerk has hadences no few others Greek is the city, and I confess a lot against an hour, does address this hotel in the whole territory of your power.  He has arisen upon this winter in our thinking & I remember his last at the charities effections in which I have received my men.  To buy over political sinners.

I hope Mabel Martin leans to you and Edna moved forward the last letter I had from Helen Rand before her marriage by January before last which was intercepted.  The last letter I had was two years ago and has ever been answered addressed ever since.  As I have you address ever so, but stones and choirs are alleviated the one as I have your address.  Even Pasell [A] to pression.

Love, ever thee.
