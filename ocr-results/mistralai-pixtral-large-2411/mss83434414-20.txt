* Mustered out of service.

Instructions were given to surgeons-in-chief to relieve the medical department of the army of the care of sick refugees and Freedmen, and aid Assistant Commissioners in establishing hospitals for the same.

The surgeons were to confer with each other, and with the Physicians appointed by the requisite number of physicians and attendants to supply the wants of the sick.

It was soon discovered that the want of congressional appropriation, and the limited amount of money at the disposal of the Commissioner for the employment of physicians and attendants for the sick, would cripple any successful effort to organize a hospital department.

The Surgeon General having authorized, in Circular No. 5, current series, medical purveyors to issue to the bureau medical and hospital supplies in accordance with the standard supply tables which I had prepared and the Commissioner adopted for the use of refugees and Freedmen, horses, mules and wagons were placed at the disposal of the bureau for transportation. They were directed to make to the chief medical officer of the bureau at Washington consolidated sick reports of their districts weekly, and promptly transmit the monthly reports, together with those of acting surgeons杀报in民宛, contracts made and annulled, circulars and orders issued; and transmit to me a requisition in blanket form and schedule of all surgeons.

Medical officers having charge of medical and hospital supplies were required to make quarterly, and when relieved therefrom, property returns, according to form, to the chief medical officer.

Previous to the organization of the bureau, as early as July 25, 1864, I was by order of Colonel R. O. Abbott, United States army, medical director, department of Washington, in addition to my other duties as surgeon in charge of Ricord hospital and member of the army medical board, required to have charge of the medical department of the Freedmen's Hospital, District of Columbia; and a complete relief system, both in hospital and quartering was established in Washington, relieving the means of furnishing to six thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine (6,929) patients medical attendance and medicines and subsistence was given to the absolutely destitute.

The first systematic efforts for the relief of Freedmen rendered destitute by the rebellion were made under the auspices of Colonel John Eaton, Jr.; 53d U. S. C. T., now brevet brigadier general U. S. vols., at Corinth, Miss., and as pursued by the Freedmen's bureau, by the establishment of a centralized camp in West Tennessee, in November 1864, which received into the nucleus of the most extensive system in the country, including in its operations the great valley of the Mississippi, under the same officer, whose humane exertions gave assistance to over one hundred thousand destitute citizens. Eleven states and territories were afterwards incorporated.

Although the bureau has not yet reached the scope of its operations, although already two (42) hospitals with accommodations for four thousand five hundred (4,500) patients are in operation, and facilities are afforded for the treatment of fifty thousand (50,000) sick in twenty-ron forty-one counties establishment by the bureau, instructions on the sick eighty-three physicians are employed under contract, and commissioned by eighty-five male attendants and seventy-seven female attendants. Of twelve regimental medical officers detailed to the bureau by department commanders, there remains but three. In this class might be men-
