Mr. Hough:
We inclose
a copy from the Kansas City Times of the 25th.  I inclose it to you for your perusal, *or denial.*  We know if your Cato Address, and friends for the state, have read the inclosed with much surprise + sorrow.  We have been mater to believe that both New York + Indiana people have been badly sold upon their opposite in Kansas; Standard Bearers Harrison + Morton or reply.  Either confirming, or denying the inclosed we will consider glad to receive such reply

Yours, &C
F.I. Steinruc.
