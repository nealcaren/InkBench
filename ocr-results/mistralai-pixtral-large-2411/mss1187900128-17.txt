I know not where to find papers for them. I appeal to your judgment. 
I have taken been friendly to the Colored Race, having resided many years at Cape Haytien in the Island of Hayti, where my husband [Bayard?] had a permanent Commercial House, under the name of Wilson & Laroche, & Co., He was also known to the present President of Hayti, as for years he was interested in the purchase of Coffee for Mr. Wilson, Laroche, & Co. Mr. Wilson was also counsel for the United States, and the recognition of Hayti was effected [through?] his means. He has earned his record in the State Department.

He is as creditable as none--as his influence public opinion on the Island of the colored people.

Begging your to excuse me for addressing you, I remain

Very Respectfully,

Frances E. Wilson
