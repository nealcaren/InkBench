Some little things I c[ould not transcribe]
put in the little red order
in trumpeter leaving the nest
and the many feet I'm
are to sit my trunks when
news I left, but the worse I had.
See your heart where dear
golden heart he has written
much of this, and I may
not length of time with one been broken.
