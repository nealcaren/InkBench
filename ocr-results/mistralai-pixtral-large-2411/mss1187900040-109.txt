But it really seems that
I can never cease to deplore
what I will for
three years bemoans against
me. - I wonder if I am as
great an idiot to sich others -
Perhaps to the orrues when at a
distance the heart is dead as
a teachings to all pices-
Ignorances of be - He
is better to be afflicted
con is instucture to be
killed afterwards to the form of
of the juggedest Harrison-
prohomті is to tell the experi-
ence what it is to be overturnd
by trouble when we have a
portion the inmiles
share of heart heritige to
lose. Their galdness is less
to them than the largest what
bears the dream.
