shown over and under the massive deck.  Re-embarking, the visitors gave three cheers for the Nanbuc, which were responded to with a hearty good will by the happy crew, who resumed their operations and pastimes.

BEDLOE'S ISLAND.

Crossing the harbor, the steamer pushed rapidly for Bedloe's Island, and we were soon ashore for a brief ramble.  Col. Chas. S. Merchant, of the regular army, received the ladies, several of whom had resided on the island in the days of hospitals and of battles, when Bedloe's Island did such service.  The stay of the party was very short, they contented themselves with a hasty survey of the island and of the harbor through the upper windows of the Colonel's fine residence.  The Colonel's family was gratified by the visit and meriting in attentions.  The donations to the garrison and patients on the island consisted of 400 baskets of strawberries, 2 baskets of cherries, 1 box of whortleberries, 2 barrels turnips, 1 barrel beans, 4 quarts lamb, 2 quarts mochos, 30 bunches radishes and beets. The garrison consists of the Sixty-seventh New York Regiment 300 muskets, and the "popular party" beside some 80 patients.  The hospitals are nearly all empty, and are soon to be pulled down.  Everything is in admirable order, and as clean as a pin.  Dr. Philip Adolphus, U. S. A., is in charge.

FORT LAFAYETTE.

Heading down the harbor our little craft was soon fairly on her way, and Fort Lafayette, a well barbetted structure was famous during the war as the scene of the treason head quarters over acts of treason against the sovereign power of our government. Passing Staten Island, whose beautiful scenery attracted the eye and refreshed the senses, we kept upon the even tenor of our way, enjoying the cool and bracing sea breeze as it came dancing over the waves, from Sandy Hook.  Saluting passing steamers with shrill whistles, waving handkerchiefs to a mail steamer, just coming in with her Ocean load, at 4 P.M. the visitors, and glad to see fair land and bustling harbor were not less so in again being the while, we at last found ourselves at the dock of Fort Lafayette.  Receiving a kind invitation to land, the plank was once more run out, or rather up, and the ladies safely piloted up the perilous ascent.  Gaining the interior, we were escorted through the corridor by Lieut. Smith, to the quarters of Brevet Brig-Gen. Burke, or as he is generally known, "Col. Burke."  The old gentleman was in a very amiable mood, and received his fair visitors in his conventional style and cordial politeness.  The garrison consists of the Seventeenth United States Infantry,
