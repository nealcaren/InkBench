Lovingly yours

You are always to do
what you have done before.  That is if you
have a little cultured
in the letters - Keep love out I beg
me Holy provision too look after it -
Ignorant Lination was round
my affection.

= I cannot write
you with what pleasure
and profound respect
I read your work.
It is as dear to my eye
and as fine perling
value to my feeling
soul to me.
