and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, the Assistant Commissioners of this bureau will once make careful estimates of the amounts of provisions, clothing, &c., which will be needed in the respective districts for the sufficiency of these supplies by monthly instalments within their respective departments, and they will hereafter quarterly, or as often as may be needed, forward like estimates. All estimates must be approved by the Commissioner of the bureau prior to issue.

Teachers, free, transportation, and quarters, have been repeatedly furnished by teachers of refugees and freedmen, to other places than the place of enlistment, when they insisted on enlistment, and they will continue to be so directed by the Commanders of Departments, Divisions and Districts, and the Assistant Commissioners may, in the meantime, continue to take portions of contracts bound for soldiers by forwarding the same to the proper persons.

Therefore, in order that there may be uniformity of action and a clear understanding in their issuance, the following rules will be adopted, and will take effect and be in force on and after, May 1, 1865, to wit:—

Rations will not be gratuitously issued to teachers of refugees or freedmen, or to other persons in the plugin, except for the benefit of such persons; but such rations are authorized by the Assistant Commissioners in this bureau, in his discretion on duty in their fields of labor under, and may purchase rations of the government under proper vouchers, which apply to such purposes to the officially commissioned by the Bureau at plan rates allowed to such rules.

Free transportation will be granted to such teachers on government transports and military railroads and military transports.

Public buildings, or buildings that may have been seized from disloyal owners, not required for military purposes, may be used for occupation for schools, teachers, soldiers’ wives, and refugees.
