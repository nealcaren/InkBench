The fact that the shrewd old gentleman who occupies governor's chair down in   Hartford isn't saying   anything   just about "the horizon" and "the hills" and the "new deal" may perhaps be explained on other grounds than those by New Haven's Republican ex-mayor. It may as somc suggest, that the Demucratic mayor of New Haven, having made a good record, deserves reelection on that as the chief issue_ It may also be that the Democrats, who  gencrally suffered in the Con necticut city and town elections not long ago, have found that the new deal isn't 'ether their best talkpoint, in Connecticut.
