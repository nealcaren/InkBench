## CoLLEGTING THE   MOURNING DRAPERIES .

Towards the close of the month, after the assassination of the President; observing the large quantity of costly drapery with which the merchants and citizens of New York had decorated their stores and residences; it occurred to me that as much of it (after its first use was concluded) would probably be wasted, it would be of much value to the poor widows and of the soldiers orphans upon this idea, I issued the following   notice in the newspapers; and in circulars addressed to the occupants of all buildings where a liberal display was observable Acting

Our efficient Ladies ' Committee will see that it is judiciously disposed of. perthey
