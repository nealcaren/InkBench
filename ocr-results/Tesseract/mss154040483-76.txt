By Carrie Chapman Catt

HE question for our consideration is whether the department of Election and Methods is ficiently   important to make it a part of the work of the   League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less appealing to many women; hut for that very reason it is more necessary for women voters to comprehend  its need. Laws suf-

We were enfranchised in 1920. We ought to have been enfranchised twenty years earlier at   least, and that is not mere talk. The reason why we were not enfranchised before some of you were old enough to take an interest in public questions was that government rarely   functions in this country, and it does not really_function anywhere in the world as There are many causes why it  does not function and any one of these causes may at any time be suflicient to nOra government   such as ouTS. long people yet. delay

Here is the address made by Mrs. Catt at the Cleveland Convention of the League of Women Voters when, at her suggestion, the Committee on Election Laws and Methods was elevated to department of work called Elliciency in Government. This speech was felt to be fine an expression of the failure of our governmental   machinery to register the  people's   wishes that it has been repeatedly asked for by our readers.

These were two questions only in that campaign and there were many others. So diflicult was it for women to the opinions wanted to express in that election that very many of them felt the vote would never he of any value to them. What happened then; happens all the time, hecause there is a conflict between the  state and the nation   and hecause   political machines and bosses do so political juggling over issues they register much gram   when necessitv arose. The combination of these lobbies suffrage has happened over and over again. Presumably the program was that of the liquor interests, but many other interests united in its support. against

There is also the autocracy  of what is known as the boss system to be watched. In one of the states which did not   ratify   there were six men charged with owned absolutely by cal boss, and boldly   and  frankly said that would not vote for ratification nor yet it nor tell any one what would do until had had their orders from their man.

A system in this   country for taking the vote of electors has been worked out. It has been from decade to decade much improved, but there are for honest voters in almost every department   and before the business of taking the vote is a perfectly con ducted one there must be a veritable revolution in the methods of taking the vote. getting the nominations,   making the platforms, and securing the legislation: pitfalls people

A Republican in New Jersey who wanted to support both the League of Nations and enforcement had to choose which he wanted the more; for he could not do both and vote one ticket An Irish Democrat in New York who to go the League of Nations and also dry enforcement found the same difliculty. they dry against wanted against

## Where We Need Reform

Perhaps we need it most in our Ours is a country governed by parties: Parties are of tremendous power in this land, so tremendous that can give the order whether a referendum submitted by the legislature shall be carried rejected, and the obedient   electors walk up to the polls and defeat or the measure. Platforms are made and are supported by those who have interest in them and voters have little Or nothing to say about issues to be included. Party loyalty  is relied upon to carry pledged to the platforms and party successfully accomloyalty usually plishes the aim set by the managers; platthey adopt

Therefore the Committee on Election Laws and Methods recommends that this committee shall be dropped and that Efliciency in Government, which is a more inclusive term than Election Laws and Methods, be made chief department   of the National   League of Women Voters. That is, the committee would magnify and emphasize political work special

Progress is made toward reform; every decade   witnesses   improvement but we are traveling forward too slowly If ours is to be the great leadnation among the world s nations we must not   only look to the   method of the registering of the opinions of the with care than is now the case, but more assiduous attention must to the education of the in the issues that are properly to be decided at the polls. being ing people greater people paid

There are three main reasons for this proposed change:
