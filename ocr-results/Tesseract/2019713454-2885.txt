What Landseer is to what Rosa Bonheur is to horses, what Mor land is to pigs, what Teniers is to Dutch boors, Oscar Pletsch is to children, their painter;  interpreter, mortalizer. It has been said that Pletsch has never had a superior; and probably not an equal, in his specialty of sketching children For presenting the American with the best drawof this admirable artist; Miss Seaverns deserves the thanks of all lovers of art. If you would obtain an idea of Pletsch's genius, his humor; truth; geniality, and beauty; a set of The Nursery , and carefully exam ine his designs. If you are not charmed with his Keeping A Hair-dresser; The Professor; A Hard Day's Wash; Ive Been AMaying; You Can't Come The Children 's   Auction; 'A morning Call,; Cooking Dinner; Getting Ready for Breakfast; &amp;c, I advise you not to set up for a connoisseur. dogs; impublic ings get Shop; Young In,
