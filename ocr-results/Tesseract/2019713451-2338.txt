## Give Special Heed to these Directions.

This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions here given take for granted that thosc on the cover of No. 1 havc bcen studied and followed. In thig No. thc letters formed from thc first four principles arc reviewed, and the terø, t, d;p, 9, are introduced.

The Dlagram on thc cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths . The copy is to be placed in the lines .

Thc Contractions used are a8 follows m. 1., Main Line ; c.1., Connecting Line ; M. Maln Line C. Connecting Line Modified ; pl., Parallel ; Principle ; Element. Slope; Slope; 8., E.

2. The order of instruction is KNOWLEDGE, ExECUTION, CRITICISM .

Becond, ExECUTION . Let them first trace thc copy with pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing the pupils to be very careful as to position, penholding, are explained in the Manual and on cover of No. 1. Do dry

First, KNOWLEDGE. Explain the copy carefully , and have it analyzed into its Principles Teach the nature, peculiarity, slope, beginning and ending of each element ; notice the connections between the principles, and the combining lines between the lettere ; call attention to similitude and parallelism of parts and lines .

not allow the pen to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch ; it should bc high enough from the desk to allow holder to be passed under its right side.

Third, CRITICISM. Criticize the line written, by asking questiong on each particular given a8 knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is a curve, it may be curved the wrong or too much or too little ; ìf sloped, then too much or too little ; the turn will be correct, or too broad, or too narrow . Select one or two of the most prevalent faults, discovered by the answers and by your own observation; for correction, direct especial attention to them, and have onc more line written that may be corrected_ Then criticize these same point8, sec many have succeeded in correcting them, and write one more line. Thus, criticize the execution of each line, and direct attention to the correction of fault after fault until the whole is perfected. Jic, they how

The line formed between two letters by their connecting lineg running into one another at thc middle of the space is termed 4 Combining Line. 4. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes ; the even, for the down. 5 There are five Elements, numbered in tho order in which occur in the principles.

Teachers will find our Manual of Penmanship a complete compendium of the art of teaching writing The Blackboard Tablets are invaluable for presenting the Elemente, Principles, and Capitals, of large size and perfect form_ The Oblique Lineg are 'a great help to the scholars in acquiring correct slope.

## SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES .

COPY 1. KNOWLEDGE . The top of 1 is a little more than half acrosg the box. Mind the of and the distance between them_ Analyze P.1 from Diag. on cover_ P.1 has been fully explained in No. 1, which see, Notice that the second 2 is perfectly straight through 1 of itg height and pl. to the first   2, with which compare it. Call attention to the bend which forms the left side of the turn, and to the way in which the right side slants up directly the turn has touched the base line. Cau tion against making 0 broad turn by turning too soon on the left, or sagging down on the right side slope

EXECUTION First, trace the copy a few times by count, giving special attention to Pogition, Penholding, Rests, and Movements. Next, one column-line  written by count. Thus, Ready , (which means place the pen over, but not on the spot are to start from,) "1,2, ready " or 66 have they

CRITICISM . Ask questions on all the particulars known. Thus, &lt; How many began in the corner ? " How many did not ? " 6( How many made the across ? ) How many not ? " "1 is the right curve of the oval How many made this curve How many the left curve ? " (Show on the board what you mean ) How many made first 2 straight ? Second 2 straight through ? ? Turn too broad ? Too nar row ? &amp;c. top &amp;c., &amp;c.,
