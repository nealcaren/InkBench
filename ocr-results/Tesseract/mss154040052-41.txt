Dear Alice Blackwell:

In this norning paper the news came that Mead has died as the result cf an accident 1s

She used to write to me occasicnally and she had told me how her husband and her sister were both in a hospital, perhaps the same one, vaiting for their call Up Yonder I take it that she was their only scurce of comfort and she went to the hespital every to read aloud tc her husband day

Every once in awhile she would out an article on peace and send it tc a little syndicate of papers that always welconed her articles I presume she did not have much money and I hope she a little pay for thcse articles get gct

She a valiant soul, if ever there was and I am sorry she has 0 one,

Lovingly ,
