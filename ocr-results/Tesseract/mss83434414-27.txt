## SOUTH CAROLINA GEORGIA .

General Rufus Saxton had, as you are aware, been most of the war in charge of matters pertaining to freedmen in South Carolina; Theoperations of the enabled me to visit Beaufort and St. Helena   islands the winter of 1864-'65, and I was schools that I found in existence under his direction and supervision. Several thousand negro refugees, which have been before described as following armies, were received by him, for the most part, in a state of utter destitution, distributed upon different vacant   lands, and cared for   until became   selfsustaining: Judging by his success large work, I gave to his South   Carolina, Georgia, and Florida   temporarily . Colonel Osborne, the Assistant Commissioner met with a serious accident while en route to his post, which detained him for a couple of mouths. to   sickness, General Saxton was delayed in extending   his organization into the interior. A few oflicers and agents, however; proceeded as Lately, South Carolina   and Georgia have been   completely   organized . From South Carolina reports from the interior of the State are with instances of violence and cruelty towards the freedmen_murders, whipping, tying up by the thumbs, defrauding of wages, over-working, combining for  purposes of extortion, &amp;c. From my own observation, I do not infer that such crimes and cruelties give true picture of the state of society. Yet the criminal list isaltogether too great to pass unnoticed.

Those   planters who   lived on the line of General Sherman's march have been obliged to struggle many difficulties in raising a crop this having little material left to work with Thus were unable to make contracts as favorable to the freedmen could otherwise done. The Assistant Commissioner finds difliculty in parties to enter into them for the next year. He reports affairs in Darling ton, Williamsl and Marion districts in better condition than elsewhere. The freelmen here are self-supporting, and there is little or n0 conflict between blacks and whites. A pass and trict. The department   commander had his   headquarters at Hilton Head General Saxton his at Beaufort, and finally at Charleston, and the provisional governor was in the northern of the State. Hence there has been much separate and some  conflicting action the of these officers, and many misunderstandings . Ibelieve; now that the department commander and Assistant Commissioner are both at Charleston, and co-operating, more order and confidence will be the result. In this State the is the presence of colored troops: It is alleged   that its   effect is to disturb   labor throughout district in the vicinity of the   garrison, and the fear is expressed by the white inhabitants that the colored troops will join the negroes in case of insurrection. against year, they they great get have ting burg, patrol part part complete general against feeling large
