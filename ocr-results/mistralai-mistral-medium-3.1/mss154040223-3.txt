Mr. John Nevin Sayre,
Committee on Militarism in Education,
Bible House, Astor Place,
New York City.

My dear Mr. Sayre:

Perhaps you know that I received the "Achievement Award" of $5000 from the Pictorial Review. The achievements for which I am supposed to have received it were for Woman Suffrage and Peace. Woman Suffrage was achieved, but of course I did not achieve it alone -- it was a collective victory. Therefore, I have sent to ten suffragists, who are old, feeble, and more or less needy $100 each, or the first $1000 from my award. To twenty Peace Societies or Organizations with Peace Departments, I have sent $100 each. For myself, I have purchased an Encyclopedia Britannica and to the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War I have given all the rest of the award.

I have not heretofore contributed to your Organization although you know how sympathetic I am with its purposes. $100 is not much, but at any rate you have never received $100 like it before and probably will never again receive one like it; so do with it what you like for the good Cause.

Very truly yours,

(Enclosure
$100 check)
