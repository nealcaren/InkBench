by Paris. You really ought
come over down here before
travelling becomes a wearisome
task. Of course you must
make our house your
home & head quarters for
the South of England. We are
living in a very pretty
country district, with fine
open downs & pleasantly
hilly & undulating country,
not grand in its features,
but very pleasing. I should
like to take you some of
our favorite walks - to
introduce you to some of
our kind friends.
My dear Morton is still
living - & often asks for you.
