Dear Journal Friends,

There is to be a Suffrage festival here Nov 14 and 15 and we are to have a Woman's Journal booth. Can you send us any decorations and a large card? We have some "Newsie" pages and I have about 50 subscription blanks. I've never done anything of this sort and have little idea how to go about it.

But Dr. MacNaughton who is getting up the festival telephoned this morning that Alice Paul had sent her word she would not pay the cost of erecting a booth for the Suffragist and if she, Dr. MacN., had to pay the cost of erecting the booth she would like it to be used for the Journal. The paper she preferred to help. I promised to see to it.
