Hon Fred Douglass
Dear Sir,

Francis M. Adlington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age sends the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument Inauguration
"Father Abraham's Monument"

This monument would seem to say
That Lincoln's dead, but 'tis not so.
In vain the assassin aim'd to slay,
In vain his blood was made to flow.
In vain the vile attempt to kill,
In all our hearts his life lives still.
And while a drop of patriots' blood
Shall flow in any human frame,
'Twill thrill at memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln's name.
This monument we raise to thee,
Great Chief whose mandate made us free,
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
For thee, our true and constant friend.

Also the following

"Address to America Personified"
The world is gazing on thee,
Dispose thy robes with care,
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy golden hair.
"Over"
