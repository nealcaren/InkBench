Six years; six years to observe the infirmities of American politics, you have had, women of America. Will you allow any power whatsoever to steal from you the significance of the vote you struggled so long to win? My suggestion is probably impractical. The only thing certainly right about it is the proposal of rebellion. No wrong was ever righted by obedience to those who have sponsored that wrong. Wrong was ever righted by rebellion against those who stand for that wrong. Think it over, pray, think again. Keep on thinking. You will find a way. When you have it, arise, put aside your ease, your soft indulgences. There is work for you. The primaries need reforming, the parties need renovating and all politics need disinfecting.

Is it true that you women have no influence as regulators, as standpatters? Then try the path of rebellion and blaze a new trail to decency and honor for your party and your nation. You can have influence if you will. Yes, a hundred fold more influence than the Pennsylvania statesman has now.

But you can only win through rebellion. The times call for the fighting spirit of the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence. You have influence whenever you are ready to fight for it. When that time comes, you women will not fight alone. There will be plenty of splendid, big-souled American men to fight by your side. Do not forget that they are many-souled American men who bore the humiliation of being so-called rubber stamps before you were enfranchised. There is no doubt that rebellion now would come when and where it is stormy, but there could be no clearer high-plucked platform now than to demand that the men who seek your support shall support the Constitution.

"It's great to be out where the fight is strong
To be where the heaviest troops belong
And to fight there for man and God."

Never fear, they'll curse you when you go in front, when you lead the men who ought to lead themselves, but never, no never, will they curse you when the victory is won. And the victory will be won.
