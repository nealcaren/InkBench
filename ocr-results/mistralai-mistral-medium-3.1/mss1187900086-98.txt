Dear Frederick Douglass

When we first saw your
appointment to Haiti - and also the
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you -
I began to clip and stick them with
the intention of sending them all on
to you - I sent "lots" of them, but alas!
in the huge piles of editorial scraps
they here all disappeared but three!
I enclose -

It was pleasant to see the
appreciation in which you are held,
while you are alive to see it -
I am not sure that we are glad
to hear you go - We need you
here.
