under public of readers. I hope
that it will have the good effect
of keeping the Negroes of the North
from deserting the Republican
Party; a suicidal step it would
be for them, as your strong and
unanswerable arguments clearly
show. These arguments, coming from
you, must have great weight with
the Colored people, who are the
ones you specially want to influence
by them. So though relieved
from office you are working away
with all your old power. I
hope that you are keeping up
your health, so that you will not run any risks by
travelling or lecturing till summer
comes again. When you last
wrote you were in Cincinnati

about one of your sons, who was ill.
I hope that he has long ago recovered
and that all your family are well.

I hoped that the book of
Mr. Carpenter's sermons & a few
other writings, which my nephew
Prof. Edwin Carpenter of Oxford is
editing, would have been out by
this time, but it will be out
or later before it appears; it is
entitled "Personal & Social Crisis"
& is prefaced by a short
memoir by Mrs. T.L. Cooke.

I am going, about the 20-
Dec for a few weeks to my daughter's
Mr. Blake's. I find it hard to
leave home, but my friend
much wishes me to, & I think
it will be well to do so. I have
now been about six weeks with
them.
