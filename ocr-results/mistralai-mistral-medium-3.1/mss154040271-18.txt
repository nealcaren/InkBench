Dear Mary,
I received a book yesterday the 27th
gift this spring! If this book had not to attain
success with a root when the author (wondershe)
has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary
I should say it mil he most
loathsome book I have ever read! I shall not return
it, nor send it to anyone else. I am sending you
a tiny box of life savers seeds. This is no great gift
but I thought the nicest idea
I had them lift & haven't the remotest idea
what any of them are, but me mil find out
if you are nearer I should like some given you
a garden full of plants from the greenhouse.
I have so many either die in my garden or
act foolish mil I have no more room.
Has proved little blossoms. They need little blossoms.
When you come down I shall take you to see a garden
of my corn. It should be worth looking at.
