James is longing to hear who is going to
Panama as he wants to go, and when James as ignorant
as a mole. Rupert says he needn't reached
home till the mail goes. I don't know when you have
gone yet. There are letters at Colon. John Larrivee
letters are always left there when not carried by
mail. I learn that mail is not carried by
the boat to N.Y. But put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you might
get them soon. I won't write to Panama.
Please accept my collective letter
as one for you. I must go & dress now.
Don't forget to write. She needs letters. So
does Lovingly indeed!
