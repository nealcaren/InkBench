Dear Mr. Douglas

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you or heard from you, and
Christie is now in hopes of pro-
voking a reply. We really are
very much in the dark about
you, I do not know whether
your civil hold office under the
Government, as we have not heard
from the Country I conclude that you
do. I hope that you have not been
hearing & holding meetings
over the country this last winter
as of old. Hope that your health
is good - and that you can report
well of yourself & of your family
