I was fired upon to draw me out the shot at
midnight to murder me and my officers
saying if we got the officers it would not
take long to fix the niggers and with the
most positive evidence that the train which
was to convey my Regt. to Charleston which
was accordingly done and respectful threats
to the effect that not one of them a nigger
officer should ever reach the coast when then
I had to teach Newbury and while getting my Regt. in camp for the
night I was fired at the head passing near
my head a few moments after which I was told
by a colored man of the town not to leave the
camp that night without a strong guard with me
as he heard the men who had fired the shot
say that they intended to kill the col. of that
nigger Regt. before morning that they had
come on the train from Anderson to do and
when at 2 o'clock in the morning a was awake
by the cry of murder in the camp which I soon
found to proceed from Foster Mills of Co. C who
had just been brought into camp from the R.R. depot
where he had been on guard (both) his head

executed him after forming my Regt. in line
often which I took up our march to Charleston
and it is a remarkable fact that no farther
outrages has since been committed upon
any member of the Regt. as none as I get
to Charleston I asked for a court of inquiry
in the case which was granted and in
whose judgement I was exonerated from all
blame but Gov Perry having carried the
story it was brought up and I was brought
before a Court Martial and was honourably
acquitted by a verdict of not Guilty and
I am again on duty. One more pleasing
fact connected with the affair is that W.T.
Bennett was the President of the Court
and that he shook by me like a brother
through it all. I was not all surprised
when Gov Perry came out so strong against
me for what can a man expect from a
man occurring as he did at the time
the position of Gov. of South Carolina and saying as
