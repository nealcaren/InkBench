first to our stomacher's,
our fires fixed for the
night, - ourselves gone to
bed -

But first of all what
a night!

The still lake. - The
faint white knees showing
in erring ranks up the
sides of the mountain
about it. - The dark lines
of smoke rising against
the quiet sky. - The sheep
sunningly washing. The
stars larger & brighter than
one sees in the latitude
land - our quiet camp
fire blazing. Yet none for
food or shelter, oh!
