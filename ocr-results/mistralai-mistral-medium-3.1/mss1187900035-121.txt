I have had a most
advantageous situation
offered me in Russia
as tutor to the first family
in the land - but I rejected it.
I have connected myself
with Mr. W[?] for the Poles
who work in Match factories -
particularly in Bristol. I refused
it again and again until
upon me - this last day,
I received a Telegram
from Petersburg - urging
me to accept the situation.
I was glad to be able
to write to Count Bobr[?]
that I was engaged in
an English family -
who have been
long before I should
have been sent to prison
