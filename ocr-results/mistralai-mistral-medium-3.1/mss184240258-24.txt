Miss Anna Dickinson,
Can. The National Republican Committee
New York City, N.Y.

My Dear Miss Dickinson:

Your valued note of the 6th
was duly received.

I have expressed your thanks
to Mr. Brown for the Indianapolis Journal
reference & to Mr. Progen for the more
extended notice of your address in our
Logansport Journal.

Not only their kindness are well
and join me in expressing our high
regard & consideration for you and
yours.

I was yesterday at Indianapolis where we had a monster demon-
stration. We hope some of your friends
will have a regret Indiana after Nov. 6.

Have noted the influence
& impression you have made where
you have been since leaving here

---
and feel confidence that your
efforts will not be in vain both in
Indiana as well as Michigan
& New York,

Very Respectfully Yours,
W.T. Wilson
