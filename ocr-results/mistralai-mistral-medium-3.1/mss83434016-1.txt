Washington, September 28, 1863.

In section 10, act of March 3, 1863, it is enacted "That the President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause to be enlisted for each cook [two allowed by section 9] two under-cooks of African descent, who shall receive for their full compensation ten dollars per month and one ration per day; three dollars of said monthly pay may be in clothing."

For a regular company, the two under-cooks will be enlisted; for a volunteer company, they will be mustered into service, as in the cases of other soldiers. In each case a remark will be made on their enlistment papers showing that they are under-cooks of African descent. Their names will be borne on the company muster rolls at the foot of the list of privates. They will be paid, and their accounts will be kept, like other enlisted men. They will also be discharged in the same manner as other soldiers.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,
Assistant Adjutant General.

Official: Assistant Adjutant General.
