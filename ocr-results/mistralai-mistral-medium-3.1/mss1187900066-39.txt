Concord June 14 1885

My dear Friend:

I have sent your volume perhaps a dozen times in a fragmentary
form, not having sufficient proofs enough to give you what I wanted.
Just yet I shall send on what advance sheets I have of the whole 650
pages and will send you an early copy as soon as it is bound. As I get
back proofs from others whom I have lent them, I shall send you
more. I have just closed the 14th chapter, Mr. Bronson's account of
his visit to Byron.
