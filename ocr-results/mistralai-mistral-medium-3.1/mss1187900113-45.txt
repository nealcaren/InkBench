I will this aquaint thee with a curious experience to me
revealed by these I would hope that fully known
their trouble could not but make common cause
with them - if so it is but a sleeping malady!

And now let me add that on Easter eve I
was sought by the Director of the Historical
Institute & informed in a noted paper - to tell me he had
proof that "Philanthropic money" as he called it could
be found in the North (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for such work as I had hinted
to which he added the suggestion mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 4 Page 1st
of the Chicago Daily Interocean of 25 March, giving an account
of a successful colored colonization at Tuskegee,
Alabama - to which I refer you, as more to interest
you. It is a number of 6 pages printed at
Tuskegee, & immense circulation; its 21st anniversary & which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair. When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion & counsel how best to proceed
in a matter so near the heart of my people.

I feel sure of your sympathy for the cause &
perhaps for auld lang syne so remote, hopefully
& with very best wishes of the season for your
continued prosperity, dear Sir
most truly yours
