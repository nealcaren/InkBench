Dear Mr. Chapman Latt,

I just finished the superb book
on the great work you have
accomplished during your
wonderfully active life.

This book is a grand inspiration
for all of us in every country.

I was deeply moved by the pages
on your international work and
the meetings in Geneva, some of
which I was fortunate enough
