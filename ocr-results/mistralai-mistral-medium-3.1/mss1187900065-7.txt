And sin-wrecked men with age
Lid graff each golden word,
And with my heart I knew them on
To see my gracious Lord

Agains I stood beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

F. E. W. Harper.

Growing old;
The prison house in which I see
Is falling to decay;
But God renews my spirit's strength
Within these walls of clay.

For me a dimmed slow creeping dawn
Around Earth's far-off light -
But Heaven grows clearer to my view,
And nearer to my sight.
