a lecture in Washington.
Then I said "I'll write" and
this is my letter of inquiry.
Have you given up your
journey to Baylor? If so I
can't help being glad as there
are so many reasons why
I have rather thought of you
both as nearer to us. If I could
have written as formerly I should
not have so long postponed my
inquiries. But I am obliged
to curtail my letters both as to
number & length.
I hope that it will turn
out that you are to pass the
winter in your pleasant and
comfortable home. Why should
you brave the terrors of the
raging seas and many inconveniences
when you are so well arranged
in your quiet and delightful
home? Not for fame or gain those
we already yours - Both of you -
I was glad to see a notice
of your lectures and wish that
I was there to enjoy it. I'm
sure that you can make your
experience very interesting and
valuable. And then Mr.
Douglass has I doubt not his
hands full of literary work
about which you can assist
him if you have not all that
you can do yourself.
I shall write to Miss Paxton
today and tell her all that
I know of your movements
because of so much I am certain
that you cannot decline in
Washington and he also on the coast
to Portland or Prince -
I want Mr. Douglass to avoid
great mental strain and so indulge
his waning years that he
may stay as long as possible with us.
