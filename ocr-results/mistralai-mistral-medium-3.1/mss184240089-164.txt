If you will hurt keep
the eye of your own
spirit turned within -
for it is ~~not~~ (with-in
not with-out) that has
the precious jewel of
truth & right is to
be sought & found -
And clearly - you
will find it, & when
you have it, and
live it - and
all men & women will
call you blessed -
heartily but so dearly,
Susan D. Mott
