Hartford, Connecticut,

If the colonels leaders talk
to announcing the supreme law,
they will find themselves in sympathy
with their best friends in the North.
The abolition of slavery is the
prohibition of discriminating
state laws. The exclusion of
the ballot to the colored man,
these are secure. If the colonels
leaders announce today that they
are for not also punishing by law,
the unauthorized and violent exclusion
of colored people from
particular public professions
will look rather childish. It
will tend to show that the colored
people can vote for the show
than for the substance of citizenship.
