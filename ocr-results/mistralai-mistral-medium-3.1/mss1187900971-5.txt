Grandpa was never called "Fred".
He was first Frederick Bailey the slave.
Changed to Johnson when he ran
away and because the man in
whose home he lived in New Bedford,
Mass. was named Johnson. This man
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglass" asked
grandpa to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, hence
would like to call him self
Douglass instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another and hence-
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass.
These facts - not hearsay.

Later - Just received letter from Fred -
he leaves on his "debating tour" today
and really debates at Harvard. He
meet stop with Cra [abbreviation, possibly for a name].
I've already written
Joe's wife & Mannie and sent Cra. word.
