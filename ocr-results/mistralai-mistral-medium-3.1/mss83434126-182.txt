exhaustion & thirst, and portions of those Regiments nearest
the river, broke ranks, rushed to it, plunged in, and
after slaking their thirst, resumed to their Colonel and re-
formed their lines. But the resistance of the Federal troops
became weak, human nature could endure no more,
a decisive victory seemed about to crown the efforts of
the rebels, at this critical moment a delivery suddenly ap-
peared, Gen'l McClellan, signalled to the Federal gunboats
to open fire on the enemy, soon their ponderous shells
burst amongst them, whole ranks were battered to the
earth, confusion quickly spread through their columns,
and they in a few moments before, so confident of
victory, were themselves compelled to give way,
Gen'l Heintzelman determined to recover the Forts, the
next day, by making a desperate charge. The gunboats
ceased firing, this veteran galloped
from column to column and cheered his men to the
attack, the enemy met them with firmness, but had
gradually to give way, their lines soon broke, and
eventually fled from the field in confusion, The
rebels previously captured a large number of cannon, lying
in portions of the batteries of Randall, Scott, Asper. The
goal of the Campaign was reached in safety, and
the soldiers of the Union, saved the honor of the
nation with the blood of its patriots.
