Jean fed us. Olga alluded the
French W. Volmers and Dodgetarmy
among them and along was
night brought a blue dress and
received a collar.

I'm hoping the war will end
in the South East and chase the Turks
out their Whitepalace and chase the
Nazis home where almost all
will commit suicide.

When we met again and he
to clean as you are,
Mrs. Mary Wellsmorecraftly you'd
be "a shinning woman"

Looking forward
