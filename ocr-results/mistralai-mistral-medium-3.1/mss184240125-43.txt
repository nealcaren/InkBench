I came to Boston in Nov. & made a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken, does not break easily. I thought I should
see you here this Spring, because the papers say so. It has been a trying winter,
but Spring & violets are near the corner.
Cousin Maggie writes me often, & is happy if her bit of house-work mile do itself.
But if she is shut in, she so mates in her "doldrums" that she frets, the hamper
chafes. She has a good practical man, to keep her from doing unheard of things. Isn't
that easy. See she's near - always.

Lovingly,
Mama Lay.
