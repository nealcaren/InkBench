Washington D.C.
Nov. 6th 1867

Dear Father,

Yours of the 1st inst. is just received.
I saw an account of one of your lectures in the
Jersey published in the N. York Tribune, and thought
that you might have other appointments, not hearing
from you. All are well except the baby, he has a severe
cold. Dr. Augusta is attending him, we are afraid he
will have the croup, but hope not. I don't wish to trouble
your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and my
self. I know your mind, and time is better occupied. You
may know the cause of the difficulty, but I know you don't
know the whole truth, and it is hard to find out under
the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone
against us. I look for another war. If you will be at home
any length of time I will write again soon, as I am
very busy just now. Libbie would send love, if she knew
I was writing. Love to Mother and all.

Your aff. Son
Char. N. Douglass
