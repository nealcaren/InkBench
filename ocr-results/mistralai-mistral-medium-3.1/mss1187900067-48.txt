feel that I am growing old, am not now what I have
been - although time has been quite generous with
me - you will see by this letter that it hardens
for me to write now then in old times when my
nerves was steady and strong. Give my kind
regards to your wife in which my good Ruth
hartily joins. Excuse this hastly written note and
believe me as ever your friend and well wisher
James M. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see
