Your rooms actually appear to have been newly papered (or painted) after we apply our exclusive cleaning process.

Dear Madam:

Before you decide to repaper and redecorate your home — why not let us show you how you may save money by cleaning the old surfaces, making them look like new, for a fraction of the cost of new work?

Whether it be PAINT, WALL PAPER, CALCIMINE or TAPESTRY — you'll be surprised how quickly and satisfactorily all traces of "soft coal smoke," dust and dirt can be removed by our special process.

We will gladly DEMONSTRATE our process without charge, in your own home — and furnish you with an estimate as to the cost of our work for one or more rooms.

In addition to our Interior Cleaning, we do INTERIOR DECORATING, EXTERIOR PAINTING, PAPERHANGING, FURNITURE AND FLOOR REFINISHING. Only the best of materials is used — only competent (white) workmen are employed — and our prices are quite reasonable. All work guaranteed.
