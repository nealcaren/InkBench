OLIVER OPTIC'S MAGAZINE.

1869. THIRD YEAR! FIFTH VOLUME!

The immense popularity which the only Juvenile Magazine published ONCE A WEEK has attained, assures the publishers that

OUR BOYS AND GIRLS,

commenced as an experiment, was needed by the young people, and is indorsed by their parents and guardians, who demand A FIRST-CLASS PERIODICAL, and are willing to pay a fair price for such, while they insist that it shall not only contain the productions of the BEST AMERICAN WRITERS who have distinguished themselves in the department of juvenile literature, but also that it shall be of the HIGHEST MORAL TONE.

The publishers of OLIVER OPTIC'S MAGAZINE, encouraged by the success of the past, will endeavor, in the coming volume, to meet the requirements of their patrons for such a work more perfectly than ever before. Having on their Trade List more than TWO HUNDRED JUVENILE BOOKS, written by the most popular authors, they are confident that their unrivaled facilities in this department will enable them to realize their ambition to furnish THE CHEAPEST AND THE BEST MAGAZINE for the young people in the United States. Their aim will still be to IMPROVE THE MIND AND HEART, and while the work shall amuse and entertain, it shall also impart valuable information in ART, SCIENCE, AND LITERATURE, and develop and encourage the purest morality. The publication will continue to be under the editorial superintendence of OLIVER OPTIC, whose books for young people have now reached the unparalleled annual sale of ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND VOLUMES. His works are in every family all over the land, and are largely relied upon by parents and guardians as moral and educational agencies in the training of their children. This popular author, while he writes AN EXCITING STORY, which shall afford young readers no excuse for resorting to the dangerous trash so abundant at the present time, endows his heroes and heroines with pure and noble characters, worthy the imitation of youth, and depicts vice in its true colors, so that the young heart may loathe and shun it. The publishers confidently challenge friend or foe to point to an impure thought or an immoral sentiment on the pages of any of his numerous works. OLIVER OPTIC writes for no juvenile publication except OUR BOYS AND GIRLS, and all his books are issued by its publishers. During the coming year he will continue the LAKE SHORE SERIES, four stories of which will appear in this volume, and which, when published in book form, will cost five dollars, as follows:

LIGHTNING EXPRESS; or, The Rival Academies.
ON TIME; or, The Young Captain of the Ucayga Steamer.
SWITCH OFF; or, The War of the Students.
BRAKE UP; or, The Young Peacemakers.

The issues of these stories in this Magazine affords an opportunity to the young people of the United States which can be presented by no other juvenile publication.
