colony of Virginia, on business demanding speedy attention. He had
crossed one of the several branches of the York river, pushing on
toward Williamsburg, when he was met by a Mr. Chamberlayne, who
had heard of the young man’s fame, and was anxious to have him as
his guest. Washington declined to stop, but Mr. Chamberlayne insisted,
and promised as an inducement, to introduce him to the most
beautiful young widow in Virginia. Washington finally consented to
stop for dinner, with the understanding that he would resume his journey
immediately thereafter. This was agreed to, and he directed his
servant to have his horse ready at the gate as soon as dinner was over.
In the parlor he was introduced to the ladies, including “the beautiful
young widow.” Her maiden name was Martha Dandridge. She had
been married to Col. John Parke Custis at the early age of seventeen,
and now, at twenty-five, was a widow with two children. Her husband
had died only the summer before, leaving her rich. She is described
as being at that time “short, plump, with dark eyes, beautiful as the
hues of the rainbow, and her hair dark and handsome. Her form
though small was full, round, and splendidly developed. She was
charming, fresh, and fragrant as the rose, and gentle as the summer
breeze.”

Washington was at once captivated and thrilled by her rare beauty
and loveliness. The passion of love at once awoke in his bosom, and
she promptly responded to it with a modest blush. ’Twas a case of
love at first sight. He remained for dinner, also for supper, and tarried
all night. Even in the morning he was in no hurry to go, and the sun
was high in the heavens before he was again on his way to Williams-
burg. He remained some time at the capital, and frequently visited
the fair widow. They were married at the White House, the bride’s
home a little over a year-and-a-half afterward, in January of 1758.

From the White House to Yorktown I went by steamer, enjoying
a delightful ride down the York river. But as I went my mind would
ever and anon contrast this ride with the last one I had taken over this
same river. Then I was in the midst of grim visaged soldiers, hasten-
ing possibly on a mission of death. Now I was in the midst of a
thousand happy men and smiling women, on pleasure bent.

Arriving at Yorktown I was somewhat disappointed. The crowd
of people was not nearly as large as I expected to see. But on reflection
I concluded this was not surprising. The location was out of the
way, in a very sparsely settled country, with poor facilities for travel.
All things considered, the attendance at Yorktown was as large as
could reasonably be expected.

The place looked much as I remembered it in the fall, winter and
spring of 1863–64. The fortifications and surroundings remained
