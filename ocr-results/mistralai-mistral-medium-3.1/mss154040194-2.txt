Dear Ms. Chapman Catt,

It was in our program of this year to read lectures on "Famous Women." Ms. Reus Ianculescu and I will do it; she in the L.D.F. and I in the popular evening courses. But as here are no complete libraries in Romania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books necessary for preparation. Therefore, we turn to you as to the other sections of I.W.S.A. to ask your help.

Feeling so much the lack of a fine library we will try at one time with our studies to found one at B[ucharest] and perhaps then we will be able to assemble around it the women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time.

Would your association be able for the generous act of sending us help with sisters and send us one of the standard works on women's movement in your country and specially on women movement in science, literature, and art?

We would speak in a first series of lectures on political and social eminent women and in a second one on the portraits of women in art and science.

But we know so little, it is to say not much
