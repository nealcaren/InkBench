Dear Miss Blackwell,

I am blessed with a
propensity to be always at something. You
are something; still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three successi⟨ve⟩
epistles might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do.

The truth is, it's hot; hot beyond
credulity, to say nothing of death. What resource else
was left but you. The other evening, so it was
spoken of to me as having done this and that
as nurse in the war, I was called on to admit
her. I had to say, yes, I admit what she did.
But must she not be a noble woman to do
so much. Then I said it may all be for us
you and she & me, to some good. So the
only recommendation we can have. But really
I look to see one who did so much credit to
recommend him, seeing whom one thinks
not how much he has done or can do, but how
much he is.

I supposed it was talking Greek,
and can't be further; but you can understand
Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
