Dear John Hall -

You are always so
good. What have you done
now? That is, if you
have a little leisure
in the evenings - read
me both the poems
of "Terror" & "Horror."

= I cannot write
you with what fervid &
profound interest
I read your word.
It is, as Mr. Hogg
says, full of "lasting
value," to me.
