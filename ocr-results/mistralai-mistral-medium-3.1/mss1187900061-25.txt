Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 20, 1883.

Honorable
Wm. Douglas,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglas:
I received your speech delivered on the occasion commemorative of Emancipation in the District of Columbia, and was particularly edified and pleased by your utterances, and surprised at the vigorous brilliancy of your powers after an almost constant exercise of them for nearly a half century in the cause of four million people.
