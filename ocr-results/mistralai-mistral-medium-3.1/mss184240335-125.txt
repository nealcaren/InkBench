The third publick bill was for restoring the Duke of Norfolk's rights where the late Duke's lights were confiscated. Without any debate, this bill passed.

The Earl of Suffolk's motion & treatment of the Royal Family, & many others, was discussed when the Lords were debating the Cardinal's trial & other matters. (Page 359)

The Cardinal was attainted of High Treason & was fined to the King. Almost immediately after his attainder, he was deprived of the See of Winchester & Sir Thomas Audeley was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal.
The Cardinal was also degraded from the Order of the Garter & the King ordered his arms to be taken down from St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

After Cranmer's "detesting," he was made Archbishop of Canterbury, & Chief of the University of Oxford & Cambridge.

After all these doings, he found he was to be deferred as a legate, was to be treated as Rome & with Cardinal's form. More were banished the Church of England due to the suggestion, then Cranmer, Suffolk & Norfolk took his part. The Parliament, not content with the Duke's submission, to show their zeal, they appointed the Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Oxford, Earl of Sussex, & the Bishop of Winchester to be a council to the Duke of Richmond in England. To answer the legatine of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the King accepted & instituted him as the Pope's Legate in England.

The Pope, upon hearing of the King's proceedings, was exceedingly angry. He wrote round to the Catholic Princes, to assist in his restoration, but they were slow in their movements. The Pope then cited the King to appear before him within three months, & if he did not, he would proceed against him by excommunication. The King, upon hearing this, wrote to his Ambassador at Rome to protest against the Pope's proceedings. The King also wrote to all the Bishops of his realm to warn them against the Pope's Bull, & to assist in the preservation of the King's prerogative, & the rights of the Church of England. The King was also declared the only Supreme Head of the Church of England. The King's Book was set forth & commanded to be read in all churches, & the Pope's authority utterly abolished. The King was declared Supreme Head of the Church of England by Act of Parliament, & the Bishops were sworn to uphold this. (They have Closed)
