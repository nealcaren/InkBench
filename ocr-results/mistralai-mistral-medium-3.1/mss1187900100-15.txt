Bailey Tenn. Nov. 9th 1891

Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement on foot here
to move three thousand families out
West. We are trying & making every
effort to get up the money. In the
name of God we call upon you to assist
us & get your friends to assist. Now
this move comes directly from the
cabins of the poor oppressed downtrodden
& outcast Southern negroes if the
northern people refuse to help us we are
dead men without a hope. All we want
is to get away from our oppressors &
then we can educate our children.
We have sent out several letters to remote
friends & we ask you to do the same in
behalf of poor suffering humanity.
For reference of writer address Hon.
L.B. Eaton Memphis Tenn. & P.M. at Bailey Tenn.

I am yours C.H. Mcombs Sec.
