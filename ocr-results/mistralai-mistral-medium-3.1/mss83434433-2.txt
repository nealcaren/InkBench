Dear Sir

I have thought of an expedient to bring
in Carolina which I submit to you. It is this: Gene-
r√°l Moses is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi.
Now if you would disperse with James & see Gene'l
& let him go & stay, his negro & get it out that he has bought
her & would I am sure bring her in & let it be out
that it is an arrangement of mine over which you have
no control. What do you think of it? Let me hear

Yr truly
from your obdt svt
