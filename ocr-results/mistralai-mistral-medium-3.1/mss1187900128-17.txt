I know not where to find pastures for them; I appeal to your judgment.
I have ever been friendly to the
Coloured race, having lived many
years at Cape Haytien in the
Island of Hayti, where my husband
kept a permanent commercial house
under the name of Wilson, Laroche,
& Co. We are well known to the present
President of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee for the house of Wilson, Laroche
& Co. Mr. Wilson was also Consul
for the United States, and the
recognition of Hayti was effected
by him in the State Department.
Be so kind as to write for us to
influence public opinion in the
favor of the Coloured people.
Begging you to excuse me for
addressing you I remain
Very Respectfully
Frances L. Wilson
