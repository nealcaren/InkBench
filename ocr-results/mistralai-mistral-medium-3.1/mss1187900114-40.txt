Life and escape from bondage for me to sell, saying if I sold
them I should have one volume to keep for my reward. I think
I sold ten volumes. They were published by Joseph Barker
of Leeds Yorkshire. My book until 1857 and some one stole it and
I never have seen one like it since.

The remembrance of the above notes prompt me to
solicit you and your wife to a trial visit. I have been
searching for days to find out your abiding home and failed
correctly to get it until yesterday. And now a line from you will
give me pleasure to say when, where, and at what time you can
receive a call from me on yourself and wife (whom I have not met)
our homes there not far apart. Salem Oh.
To you remember Benjamin Pownal and wife and Anti Slavery
days. They had a daughter the married John Deming.
My brother's daughter is married to her son at Salem Ohio.
The Demings have an orphan child in Manufacturer Hull.
Her husband has been in the Fair. Saw her through my glass on
Medician day in your booth awaiting your early answer with best
wishes truly yours. Henrietta Harris
