Department but have not received an
answer yet. I expect one tonight. It has
been beautiful weather ever since you left
and I do not think we will have much
snow but it will be keen and sharp.
Elizabeth is making preparations to read
her lecture next Monday night and have
us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.
I believe she has more sense by other appointments
for her but I think the Governor and
Colonel Lewis will attend it. It is causing
a great deal of noise and confusion being
in the schoolroom and the few who have as
possible. I hope you will have as comfortable
a time as possible and that you
will not return to Mexico. Old Brown
the Governor of Missouri has a row on his hands
he has offered for his capture and it will
turn himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love
and enclosed you will find a note
from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie
will send a few lines.

Your affectionate daughter,
Rosetta Dougherty
