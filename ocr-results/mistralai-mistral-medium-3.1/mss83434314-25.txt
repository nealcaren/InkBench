It sometimes happens—as, for instance, during the temporary absence of the Commander of a department, &c.—that a copy of a letter is received for record in the book, several days after its date, and after one or more letters of subsequent date have been recorded. In such a case it will be copied in the book in the usual way, but a note (in red ink) will be made—between the letter dated immediately prior to the communication in question and the one written next after it in point of date—giving the number of the letter and the page on which it is recorded.
