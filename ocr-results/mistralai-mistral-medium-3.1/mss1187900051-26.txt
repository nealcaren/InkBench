Friend Douglass,

I started from Rochester yesterday
morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake.
Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp
a few miles north of the Rush Reservoir.
I attached a pocket instrument upon the
wire and communicated with the person
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your
first card. Before I left home I read
your telegram, & went to the Rock Sav. Bk.
where the draft was proclaimed and notified
them of its non-receipts, and if your wish
for a duplicate. They said that they
could not give another until they ha[d]
received their ape from the Clearing House
at N.Y., which would be the first week
