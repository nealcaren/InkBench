we make so sure of nature,
blissful meetings, where
farewells are not - Said
I remember from which you
took Frederick's dislike to
me - but at the same
time, I never found
any dearer friend or one
so precious to me. Amidst
the many trials & heartaches
I have gone through, I can
realize that "all things
must work together for
good" - When we reach your
glorious city, we shall be able to look
back on all the way the
Lord has led us to
humble us - I have us -
May our Heavenly Father
bless you. May He ever keep
you in love with Him and a-
ffecting the world.
