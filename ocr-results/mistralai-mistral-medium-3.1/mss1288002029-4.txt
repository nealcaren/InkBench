"The Governor means right," said Mrs. Howe. "He means that, in view of the indigency and ignorance of many of the women of the State, it would not be expedient for them to vote. I believe that women may very well have abstained from voting."

"Do you agree with the Governor in his implication that the ballot may prove to be an unfortunate experiment?"

"The point that I should make," replied Mrs. Howe, "is, who has the right to determine whether it is an unfortunate experiment or not? The portion of the community that has the right to make the decision. There are some who do not admit that universal suffrage is good, but we are not allowed to limit the suffrage. It does not belong to men to give or to take away. By existing forms of law men must give it to us. I do not allow that the obligation to vote implies the right to limit the suffrage. It may appear to some to be an unfortunate experiment."

"How do you view the Governor's proposition to have women vote on the question of suffrage or against themselves?"

"It is a very difficult matter to speak offhand, but I will say that I hardly think that a matter of such evident and paramount importance should be submitted to the vote of a popular convention. It is not a matter for the people to vote on."

"What would the effect be, do you think, of such a vote?"

"I do not see that, if we do settle the question in that manner, and it turns out in our favor, we can do nothing more the same year. We have got the suffrage, goes ahead, and it is anybody's business to keep it settled. Anything which the state is bound to do as of right I don't think it should commit."

"TO THE CHANCE OF A POPULAR VOTE."

"How would the majority of the women vote on this question were it submitted to them?"

"I should feel very uncertain about that. Women of fashion and fortune would go against it, and, while I do not believe there are so many of them, I fear that a great many of them would not support the measure. There are also a good many young women in easy circumstances who would follow in the footsteps of their mothers, husbands, and lovers, and vote against it. But nearly all women graduates of colleges, and all professional women will vote 'yes.'"

"Do you like the Governor's plan of postponing the experiment of voting for school suffrage at the usual public voting places until something which resembles an improvement is reached?"

"Yes, that is a very good idea. In view of the great possibility of falsification, women should vote as men do."

"What do you aim for particularly in the immediate future?"

"I would strike for municipal suffrage. We cannot always command the order in which things are to come. We must never lose a moment's time. We must take advantage of every opportunity."

"What, in your judgment is the outlook?"

"The rapid rise in the culture of woman, and particularly in the study of political and economic questions, are all carrying society in the direction of woman suffrage, in spite of what individuals may do or think."
