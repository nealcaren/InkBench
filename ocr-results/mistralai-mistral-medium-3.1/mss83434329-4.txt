wires—the utter annihilation of all the endearing relations of human life, and the substitution of the single relation which *property* bears to its *absolute proprietor*.

Sir, shall that be the creed of this Republic? Shall the law remain in the very heart of this Republic, which declares that a man may be hunted as an outlaw, and that the moment he is so declared, every man is his enemy? Shall the law remain in force, which, to prepare them for freedom, degrades the race of men to prepare them for the market, and which declares that men may be bought and sold, and that they are not entitled to a trial by their peers, to restore and protect the *domestic relations* which slavery has destroyed? Shall the law remain in force which denies to the black man the right to the soil on which he was born, and which, in the language of the Supreme Court, declares that he has no rights which the white man is bound to respect? Shall this be the creed of this Republic? Shall these be the cardinal principles in my political creed, that, in opposition to my individual, and all the principles of the Declaration of Independence, I am to be made the victim of an unconstitutional and tyrannical law? No, sir, I will not do it. I say now, and I say it with full knowledge of the consequences, that I will not recognize the right of any man to say who shall be my friend, and who my enemy. I will not recognize the right of any man to say to me, “You shall not speak to that man, or write to that man, or employ that man, or be employed by that man.” I will not recognize the right of any man to say to me, “You shall not protect that man in the enjoyment of life and liberty, if you can.” I will not recognize the right of any man to say to me, “You shall not protect that man in the enjoyment of the fruits of his labor.” I will not recognize the right of any man to say to me, “You shall not protect that man in the enjoyment of his wife and children.” I will not recognize the right of any man to say to me, “You shall not protect that man in the enjoyment of the education of his children.” I will not recognize the right of any man to say to me, “You shall not protect that man in the enjoyment of the privileges of a citizen of the United States.” I will not do it. I will not give my assent to any such doctrine. I will not recognize it.

An honorable gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Pierce) has said that no one in his Constituency was in favor of the object of these petitions, and that he should not present them. I am glad he has told us so. I am glad he has told us that he has no respect for the rights of petition. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the system of slavery, and that he is opposed to the abolition of slavery. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the internal slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *domestic* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the foreign slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *piratical* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *murderous* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *infernal* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *accursed* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *unholy* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *damnable* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *infernal* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *accursed* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *unholy* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *damnable* slave trade. I am glad he has told us that he is in favor of the *infernal* slave trade.

But, Mr. Speaker, while I thus repudiate the doctrine of the immediate and unqualified abolition of slavery, I maintain the duty of *immediate and absolutely* abolishing the internal slave trade. I maintain the duty of *immediate and absolutely* abolishing the internal slave trade. I maintain the duty of *immediate and absolutely* abolishing the internal slave trade.

The Southern country has been suddenly flooded with the Northern men with anti-slavery publications, and Northern meetings were, therefore, convened to denounce a participation in the obnoxious measures. These meetings were numerous in the cities of Washington and Alexandria, especially in the latter, where a large receptacle of the slave trade is established. The resolutions of the meeting at Alexandria were more violent, and more likely to lead to immediate action than those at Washington.

Persons having servants to dispose of will find it to their interest to give me a call as I give higher prices, in many instances, than any other purchaser who I know, or may hear of. My permanent business will detain me in the city for several months.

more obvious than the danger of failing to accomplish any thing by a premature effort to accomplish at once all that we desire. I have a plan of my own, and I believe public sentiment at the North is not understood here. I believe, sir, it is fairly misunderstood. A large majority of the people are opposed to certain views and measures, connected with the proposed abolition of slavery, which have been urged upon them. They are not prepared for the immediate abolition of slavery in this District, and I think it would be unwise to press that subject. The people of the North are not so much opposed to the abolition of slavery as they are to the measures which have been adopted to accomplish that object. I am not prepared to say that the people of the North are not in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District. I believe they are. But I am prepared to say that they are not prepared to sanction the measures which have been adopted to accomplish that object. I am not prepared to say that the people of the North are not in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District. I believe they are. But I am prepared to say that they are not prepared to sanction the measures which have been adopted to accomplish that object. I am not prepared to say that the people of the North are not in favor of the abolition of slavery in this District. I believe they are. But I am prepared to say that they are not prepared to sanction the measures which have been adopted to accomplish that object.

Permit me now, Mr. Speaker, to examine, for a few moments, the objections which have been urged against the legislation of Congress on this subject.

We are told, in the first place, that this is a question which concerns exclusively the people of this District; that the petitioners have no right to interfere, and that the people of the North have no right to petition. The preamble to the Bill of Rights declares that a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles and a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty, and to promote the happiness of the people. The Constitution declares that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. The Constitution declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. The Constitution declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States. The Constitution declares that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808. The Constitution declares that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.

But, sir, it is not the Constitution which is the question. It is the power of Congress which is the question. It is the right of the people of the North to petition, which is the question. It is the right of the people of the North to express their opinions, which is the question. It is the right of the people of the North to express their opinions, which is the question. It is the right of the people of the North to express their opinions, which is the question. It is the right of the people of the North to express their opinions, which is the question. It is the right of the people of the North to express their opinions, which is the question.

The following advertisements appear daily, in the principal newspapers of this city:

But, sir, it is said that it concerns this Territory exclusively; that it is a local question, in which the people of the North have no right to interfere. I deny it, sir. I deny it. I deny that it is a question which concerns this Territory exclusively. I deny that it is a question which concerns this Territory exclusively. I deny that it is a question which concerns this Territory exclusively. It is a question which concerns the whole country. It is a question which concerns the whole country. It is a question which concerns the whole country. It is a question which concerns the whole country. It is a question which concerns the whole country.

Sir, I will only say that it concerns the whole country, because slavery is a national evil, and it is the duty of the nation to remove it. It is the duty of the nation to remove it. It is the duty of the nation to remove it. It is the duty of the nation to remove it. It is the duty of the nation to remove it. It is the duty of the nation to remove it. And, sir, I will not be deterred from the performance of that duty by any threats, or any intimidation. I will not be deterred from the performance of that duty by any threats, or any intimidation. I will not be deterred from the performance of that duty by any threats, or any intimidation. I will not be deterred from the performance of that duty by any threats, or any intimidation. I will not be deterred from the performance of that duty by any threats, or any intimidation. I will not be deterred from the performance of that duty by any threats, or any intimidation.
