And I am sure she would
find many old friends.
Let me urge you to honor
us by your presence, and welcome
you as half if not quite
as a Boston alumnae.
As I am uncertain of
your address, I send under
cover to Mrs. Clara K. Hill,
Boston. Sincerely hoping for
the pleasure of seeing you and
Mrs. Douglas, I am
Most cordially yours
Sarah A. Burgett
