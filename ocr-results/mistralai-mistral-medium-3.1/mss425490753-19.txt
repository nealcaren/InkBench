Building the Builders of Chicago
J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year), Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), rally to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked beans go big with Cornelius—Barbara says the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy goes hard for the soup and a big cut of that spicy mince pie.
You are building a better Chicago—we are building better Chicagoans.

RUTH McCORMICK, DENEEN SOUND CAMPAIGN CRIES
Senator Attacks County Administration
By PARKE BROWN
Both United States Senator Deneen and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, who has announced her candidacy for the senate, yesterday was constructed as a desire to see the actual campaign start.
Miss McCormick, who will be in Chicago next week for the opening of road headquarters, told 100 of her followers—Chicago ward committeemen and officers of the women’s Republican club at a luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It was the first time that the senator and the congresswoman appeared together before a political gathering since they became rivals for the Republican nomination.
Mrs. McCormick, just before leaving for Washington, issued a statement charging that a “propaganda factory” is circulating false reports that she is a candidate for the senate, and that she has withdrawn from the race.
“These and other false reports have been spread over the state with such persistence that I have been impelled to credit to the industry of the propaganda factory that is sending them out,” she said.
“I want to say emphatically now that I am in the race for the Republican nomination for United States senator and that I shall be in the race every minute up to the closing of the polls on April 8.
“I have traveled 34,000 miles in the state of Illinois in 1927 and 1928 in my campaign for congress. I am going to make an even more vigorous campaign for the senate. I have already established state headquarters on the seventeenth floor of the London Guaranty building, 36 North Michigan avenue.
“I am returning to Washington today to attend the sessions of the short session of congress. I will return to Illinois in January to continue my regular duties in the house and to speaking campaign immediately on my return from Washington to Illinois.
“I have no intention of withdrawing from the race, and I want my friends to know that I am in to win.”
Senator Deneen, in a statement issued from Washington, said:
“The penalty of what we have done is in the hands of our people. If the people have permitted a few to vote by tolerating the breakdown of law and order and economic and political conditions, then the penalty is theirs.
“The economic laws have moved slowly against the corrupt political machine and the lethargy of the public officials and the lethargy of the public itself.
“The bankruptcy in the character of public officials which has been apparent for years has now followed by bankruptcy in almost every department of government.
“And it is all our fault. We have permitted unworthy prejudice to influence us. We have permitted ourselves to be influenced by small favors to them again and again without regard to good government.
“Now we are paying for it in high taxes, and the people have permitted themselves to be led into the belief that the penalty of what we have tolerated in our local government.
“We are to pay for it in high taxes, impaired police and fire protection, and in the public health, the poor and the sick must suffer, and the funds of the city must go to pay the penalty for our sins.
“The statement of Mrs. McCormick read as follows:
“In this great campaign let us emphasize on my return from Washington to Illinois, I will require a minimum of interruption in the duties of my public office. I have no intention of withdrawing from the race for the Republican nomination for the United States senate.”
