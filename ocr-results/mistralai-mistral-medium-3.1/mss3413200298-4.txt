Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note about
Mrs. Blackwell go unanswered, even
if the check I enclose like to send
must be omitted.

I have always admired Mrs. Blackwell,
and, in late years, have loved her
especially. Her always beautiful Christ-
mas and Easter messages, and her
indomitable spiritual grace are such
lovely additions to the great back-
ground of her life work.

It wrings my heart to know that
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.
There are so many who are! I am one
of them myself, or because I would
share in making the fund which you
are raising.

Bemp a starving artist
is a most pitiable handicap,
in every way, but it is particularly
hard to endure when appeals like
this come.

Thank you for including me
as one of her friends, which
I most heartily am.

Sincerely,

Mary Ware Dennett
