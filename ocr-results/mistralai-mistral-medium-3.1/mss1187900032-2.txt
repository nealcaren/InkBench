Supper we all went to the woods
to skate and skated until Japas
eight o'clock and then came in and
sat talking until time to drop after
hours home they all have consen-
ted for me not bringing my skates
with me and if it is convenient
first that you would have them
sent with my other things. I must
cut this letter short as it is almost
bedtime and are almost up
at five o'clock. I should like to
hear from home once in a while
and you shall hear from me
often. I know this is not as good
writing as you could be
but I am so sleepy tonight

From your affectionate
Son Charles R. Douglas
