not leave their names, but said
they would see her again. Also
that another one, giving the name
of Mary Johnson, called the other
day to ask "if Miss Anna had
anything for them" - I don't know
who she is, though Annie says she
has been here several times before.

My poor old German teacher,
Prof. Reese, has gone to his long
home - was buried last Sunday,
they will remember my speaking
of his failing health.

Wilmington Oct 24th '67
Dearly loved daughter
On this thy mother's birth day
anniversary at hand,
only think! twenty five
mile stones and the
beautiful spring time
of life pilgrimage almost
lift behind thee. How has the
father of the faithfully
been with thee and around
about thee, from the dawn
of life, even until now.
