IN THE LAND O’ COTTON

President Warmly Received in Georgia Today.

VISITED MOTHER’S HOME

ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROSWELL AND ATLANTA.

Many Tender Recollections of His Early Childhood Awakened by Visit to the Old Homestead.

ROSWELL, Ga., October 20.—President Roosevelt today carried out his long-cherished plan of visiting the home of his mother—Roswell, Ga. One of his reasons for coming south was for this purpose.
The President at 7:30 o’clock this morning, and was joined here by Senator and Mrs. Clay, who were his guests at breakfast. He then entered a carriage and was driven to the mansion. This fine old homestead is now the property of J. D. Wing, a lumber merchant of this section, who lives in it with his sister, Mrs. Wood, the postmistress of Roswell. Two old servants who lived on the place during his mother’s young womanhood, one of these is “Aunt Grace,” who acted as maid to Miss Martha Bullock, who afterward became Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, and the other is William Jackson, who decorated the mansion on the occasion of the marriage of its young mistress.
The President was deeply touched as he shook the hands of these old servitors. In company with Mrs. Roosevelt he then inspected the house, calling the attention of the company many incidents connected with his mother’s childhood. Before leaving the mansion he posed with Mrs. Roosevelt for a picture which included “Aunt Grace” and “Uncle William.”

The route of the parade was about three miles long. The President’s train rolled into the terminal station exactly on time, and as it was sighted coming into the city blew whistles and the waiting on the station platform were the reception committee, headed by Governor Terrell, Senator S. A. Clay, Congressman Livingston, Mayor Woodward and Bishop C. K. Nelson. To greet Mrs. Roosevelt was a small committee of ladies led by Mrs. Charles A. Collier, wife of the governor. Mrs. Roosevelt was made an honorary member of the committee on reception.

The President came to a stop at Gov. Terrell and Senator Clay’s car, where he was greeted by Mayor Woodward and other members of the reception committee. The original plan to have the President pass the waiting crowd in the station was vetoed by the secret service, and the party was taken to the street level by a baggage elevator and entered carriages back of the station.
Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th Infantry, acting as marshal of the day; platoon of mounted police; troop of the 12th Cavalry, Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., commanded by Maj. H. G. Sickel; President’s carriage, containing beside himself, Secretary Loeb, Gov. Joseph M. Terrell and Maj. James G. Woodward; carriage containing members of the President’s party; troop of the 12th Cavalry; carriages of reception committee, city council and delegation from the Federation of Trades; Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th Infantry, U. S. A., Fort McPherson, Ga., and staff.
Seventeenth Infantry Band, 5th Regiment Georgia state militia and band; Drum and bugle corps, Atlanta provident regiment; consoling cadets from the Georgia Military Academy, Gordon Institute and Marist College, Governor’s Horse Guards and other military organizations.

The line of march was quickly formed and the escort started for Piedmont Park. The marching order was as follows:

Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th United States Infantry, acting as marshal of the day; platoon of mounted police; troop of the 12th Cavalry, Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., commanded by Maj. H. G. Sickel; President’s carriage, containing beside himself, Secretary Loeb, Gov. Joseph M. Terrell and Maj. James G. Woodward; carriage containing members of the President’s party; troop of the 12th Cavalry; carriages of reception committee, city council and delegation from the Federation of Trades; Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th Infantry, U. S. A., Fort McPherson, Ga., and staff.

The route of the parade was Mitchell street to Peachtree, to 14th, to Piedmont Park.

At the Fair Grounds.
The President arrived at Piedmont Park at 11:10 o’clock. The steam whistles of the state fair blew an enthusiastic welcome and the thousands assembled shouted themselves hoarse as the President entered the grounds. A review of the military escort was held, headed by the 17th Infantry, which returned a few weeks ago from the Philippines.
From the grand stand erected facing the grand stand of the race course the President delivered his address. Dudley Hughes, president of the fair association, at whose invitation the President was present, introduced Gov. Terrell, who in turn presented Mayor Woodward and Mayor Woodward presented the President and was followed by Senator Clay, who introduced the President.
The President’s allusions to the President’s efforts for international peace were received with rousing cheers. Mayor Woodward presented the President with a bouquet of Georgia marigold, a memento of Georgia’s organized labor, prepared by union labor.
As the President arose to speak he was greeted by the immense throng rising and cheering.
(The full text of the President’s speech will be found in another column of The Star today.)
