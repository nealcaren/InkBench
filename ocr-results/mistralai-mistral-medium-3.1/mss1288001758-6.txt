What may do for Sumner -
Just this moment comes the
little boy with a letter
thank you Dear Mama -
Sympathize with the poor
girls feel at Mr.
Bissons decline. But all
things work together for good
to God's souls as Jesus said.
Harry don't never mind,
there must be something good
in store. In somewhere, because
it's done it I am glad
the children are as good as
nice pie. If hope they will
keep so. You may count
to have some on the butter.
Please look and see if there
is any. Love to Mother and
all. But most for
Yourself.
