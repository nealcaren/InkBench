To the Speakers Bureau:

Those roses were sweet, beautiful, simply dazzling, but
Roses and Verboten.

Kindly return my money to dep't to remediate my
character. Please don't disobey orders again.

I have a vile temper, growing viler every day which
shows what politics will do for a woman!

Is a daily comfort, nonetheless the pleasantry of
the Speakers Bureau.
