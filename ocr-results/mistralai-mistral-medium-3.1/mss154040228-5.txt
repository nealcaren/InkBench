Dictated 11-20-'31

My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am in the General Hospital, Osteopathic Unit #780 at Los Angeles, at present with a fractured leg.
I have been here 8 weeks today.
Hope soon to be released from this terrible house of torture, so that I can return to my little apartment at
609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena, Calif. Many friends, wonderful to me in every way.

Address me close friend Mrs. Lois Janes, 1718 Oak St., So. Pasadena who has all -- of me in charge.

Cordially,
Henrietta G. Moore

P.S.
