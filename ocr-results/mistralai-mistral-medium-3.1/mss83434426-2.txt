her heirs or assigns the just and full
sum of four hundred dollars in
current funds; it being for the kind
of a negro slave named Turner which

ner of hirelings with the exception of
a blanket (it is understood by the
parties that should the said negro die
he taken either by the enemy or the
Confederate authorities the amount of the
time lost shall be deducted from the
hire.) For the true payment of which
sum we bind ourselves jointly and severally
our joint and several heirs, executors
and administrators with
our hand, and seals this 4th day of January
1865.     H.T.E. Williams
