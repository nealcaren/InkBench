But it really seems that I am never meant to have what I wish for.
Every thing seems against me. I wonder if home is really determined
to suffer. Perhaps it is the only means of softening the heart, and
of teaching us true sympathy. If so, it is better to be afflicted,
for it is terrible to be indifferent to the sorrows of our fellow creatures.
I hope it is. By sad experience I know it is better to be deceived
by those we love than not to love at all.
Their coldness is worse to bear than the forlorn which breaks the heart.
