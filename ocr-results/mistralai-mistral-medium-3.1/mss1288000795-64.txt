Dr. Lilian Johnson am representing 3 groups of women as to rural organization. Smith Lever bill quits each state $10,000 annually, & more if State Legislature will appropriate equal amount - women will get their fair share only if they demand it. Write to yr Agricultural college & ask to recommend State Suff Assns to do this.
