And am glad to feel that they have
brought me more than they have taken
away. I have lived over and beyond
many vain visions, and am content to
find myself beloved and useful in a
small sphere.

This beautiful, but far away, land, separated
from all my friends, and from the many
interests which have heretofore made my
life. A more complete contrast to a large
city can hardly be imagined than if
surroundings here.

I think you would be sorry for my
mother were you to see her now. Her body
lives, but her mental powers are sadly
impaired. The care of her is onerous
at times, for she is in the border land
between sanity and insanity, and
cannot yet be left to other hands than
mine. She is quite an aged woman -
seventy-five years old.

And yet, Dad, as it is, it is in some ways
easier than the relations between us
used to be. She has no power any more to
spoil my life, and patience is comparatively
easy, because of the feebleness of her
present condition.

But you will wonder why I am in

his beautiful, but far away, land. I was spared
from all my friends, and from the many
interests which have heretofore made my
life. A more complete contrast to a large
city can hardly be imagined than if
surroundings here.

My youngest brother, a most able fellow,
of individual promise, had a brilliant
professional future before him, when owing
to mental strain and overwork, his
health gave way. He fell a victim to that
dreadful disease locomotor ataxia.

He cannot live in New York. The last
winter we were in Madison Square had
a very trying one in regard to weather,
and a very sad one to us, as we were
feeling keenly our recent bereavement
in the sudden death of my eldest brother's
sweet young wife, who had endeared
herself to all our hearts in quite a
remarkable manner.
