cause that I know of none
done with me. The last
time I saw her she scarcely
paid me "the cold respect of
a passing glance." She can,
Mrs. Putnam, quite justly
when you complain that
I did not speak of the
labors in the cause of the
slave performed by Miss Holly.
Thinking of the many other
excellent women who were
not mentioned.
Faithfully yours,
Fredk. Douglass
