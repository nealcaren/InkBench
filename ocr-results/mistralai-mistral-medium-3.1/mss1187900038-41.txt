My dear Mrs. Donglass,

On our return from our three months' tour through France, Italy & Switzerland, we spent a few days at Woodcote, (Crystal Palace) before reaching Bridgeport, and there we found your kind & welcome letter awaiting us. It is always a great pleasure to receive one of your nice long letters, & the one (dated May 25th) was as usual full of interest.

I trust you will have many such adventures as the one you describe as having taken place in Baltimore last winter. It was a mercy that you escaped uninjured, but you might not be so fortunate another time. So do be prudent as to where and how you travel, and remember how very valuable
