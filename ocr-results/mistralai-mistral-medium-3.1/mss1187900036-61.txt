Caroline to be at home
up to your visit. You know
how happy it would make
me. It is so kind of you to
give up the affectionate
trip to Switzerland - but
I think it would be better
about three weeks. I must
be in England on
the 23rd of August. My
father writes that he
will be in Paris - to see me
return to London. They have
not heard from
Louisa for a long time. During the
last six months - she was
quite unwell. Oh! They would
not hear of any separation from their own child.
