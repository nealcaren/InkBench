I do not think
he ever means to
pay me. He is a
very pretty
young man and has a pretty
good disposition but
careless. Lets a bill run till
he says "close
the door" some one has
lent him ten dollars which
he could not pay. He spoke broken English
and I have made
a botch of it. He lost
his purse and I lent him
some. I cut a slip
out of the morning paper
the other night which
said he had given a
much larger sum for your fur
mink robe and
a big sum for yourself. Mr.
