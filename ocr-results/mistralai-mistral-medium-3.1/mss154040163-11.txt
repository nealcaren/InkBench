My dear Steady,

I have to thank you for two letters and the notes and clippings concerning Mrs. Blum. I thank you especially for the clippings for as you suspect, I am interested in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the National Convention, Mrs. Severance brought a letter she had received from Effie Vance, and she had described very vividly how Mrs. Blum had been able to rise above her suffering through Christian Science. Tears flowed as she read it, and she was no great admirer of Mrs. B. I believe she told me that Effie Vance was also getting interested in Ch. Sci. Mrs. B. was one of the most generous and forgiving natures even, and although she also had her weaknesses of character, as we all do, to the rest of us, she was a woman to be admired for very many estimable qualities.
