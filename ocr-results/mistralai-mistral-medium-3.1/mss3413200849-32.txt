You may have already seen - if so, just destroy them. This one - pasted below - struck me as particularly lovely.

I wonder if you knew Dr. Lewi?

[*MEMORIAL SET UP
TO DR. EMILY LEWI
Friends of the late Dr. Emily Lewi yesterday presented a check for $14,000 to the trustees of the New York Infirmary to start an endowment fund in her memory.
Income will be used for the care of ailing women physicians connected with the Infirmary and their children.
The check was presented to Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the board of trustees, by Dr. Marion Manter, medical director of the Infirmary, at the end of a meeting of the trustees in the Fuller Building, 597 Madison Avenue.
Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Lewi: "She was one of the older doctors who had the courage of their convictions and the consecration to uphold the Infirmary as a center of training and service by women doctors. Without her work and that of her associates the Infirmary would long since have closed its doors."
Dr. Lewi, who died two years ago, was a pediatrician who practiced more than fifty years and served as director of pediatrics at the Infirmary from 1930 to 1938. She was known as an outstanding teacher and diagnostician and was one of the pioneers in endocrinology.
One room in the projected new Infirmary building will be known as the Emily Lewi Memorial Room, the trustees said, and the endowment will support it.*]
