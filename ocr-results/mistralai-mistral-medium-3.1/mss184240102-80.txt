Friday Mar 8

My dear friend,

Yours from Detroit came to hand, and I understood you were to be there at just that time but I could not have met you. I was sick for Mrs. L. I was very much disappointed from not seeing you and Mother. I enjoyed myself very well. I do hope that Julia is in better health. I hope it has one long summer.
