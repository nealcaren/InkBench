A. Douglas Esq.
Sir:

Clippings from the Kansas City Times
of the 25th. I enclose to you for
your verification, or denyals. Hundreds
of your Col. admirers, and friends
in this state, have read the enclosed
with much surprise and sorrow.
We have been induced to believe that
both New York, and a Indiana
Caucus be fully released upon to
Cast their Electorate vote for Gen.
Galusha P. Bears. Harrison
Ann Morton. A reply, either
confirming or denying the enclosed,
will greatly oblige
Yours &
A.F. Stevens
