I knew a good speech when I hear it!! I wish I took
his opinion when I was about,
surely I should mine when I
have the same chance to judge
as he -

I don't know why you
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter from my western
friend but I enclose a
copy.

Goodbye
again
with heartiest
wishes for your health
especially if you think of
facing the rigor of a
New England winter next
July.
