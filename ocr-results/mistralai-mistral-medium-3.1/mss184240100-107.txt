Boston Dec'r. 25th.

My dear Miss Dickinson

Your favor of the 19th. containing a draft for five hundred dollars came safely to hand, and I should have acknowledged its receipt at once, but it was found both Leavitt and myself to do even so little. We are more: better and hope to continue so.

At all events we shall try. Xtmas. many thanks, for your kindness - Leavitt sends much love to you and your Mother.

Ever yours Truly,
Wm. Brackett
