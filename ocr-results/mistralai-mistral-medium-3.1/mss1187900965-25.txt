Dear Doniply,

I think the quotation at the head of your article a little bit off color. There is an appeal to mercy, to her as Justice --

I think the following from the same play is better:

"You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life,
When you do take the means whereby I live."

You will pardon the suggestion, Mr. Doniply?
