Columbus O. 5.17.1891

Dear Mr. Hart,

A thousand thanks for helping me on ready to go to Phila. What I desire -- when?

I fully appreciate your great kindness in this service it will be to me. It took so much time at Pittsburgh, but it is good like a meal once a day quite often might if I am able to find one. May I have a line to friend thee
