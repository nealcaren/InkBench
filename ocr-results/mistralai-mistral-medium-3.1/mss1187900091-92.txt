THE RE PUBLICAN LEAGUE,
NEW HAVEN, CONN.,

September 28, 1890.

My dear Douglass:

On my passage thro'
New York yesterday from Phila. where I
spoke on Friday evening, I called at Kenn-
ard & Co's office for news about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is what the clerks
in the office assured me of:

The steamer is the "Oranje Nassau".
She will sail from Pierrepont St. Wharf (along
side of the Wall street ferry), Brooklyn,
on Friday next, 4th instant, at noon, for
Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count our this
information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the
"Oranje Nassau" is the poorest steamer of the
line. But she is steamship and sound and I
guess we can stand it for six days on board.

Yours,
