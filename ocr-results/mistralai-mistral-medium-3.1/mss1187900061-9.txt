instead of making murletta and biscuit I would try
send you a line. I hope you will excuse bad writing
and spelling as you will find. I have seen Miss
Kriger twice since you left. Everything is going
on just the same so I have no news to tell
you all are well at home hoping that
you are. Rosa is well and sends love to you.

Truly your friend
