Mrs. Inez Haynes Irvin,
240 West 11th Street,
New York, N. Y.

Dear Mrs. Irvin:

In reply to your circular letter, I am obliged to say that I am unable to help anywhere along the line. I am doing nothing or not much, at least, for any cause outside of my own responsibility. I have difficulty to perform even those duties. I cannot contribute and I cannot send names of wealthy women who might be interested.

I do not believe that the archives can be made possible by small contributions of many members. An endowment of considerable size is required to make it possible. I do not feel so much enthusiasm for it as I would if the possibility of securing that endowment was more promising.

I am troubled myself over the problem of what to do with the things I have which belong in such archives provided the venture does not materialize in time to receive them.

Very sincerely yours,

Carrie Chapman Catt
