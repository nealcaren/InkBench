ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, a pioneer of woman’s rights. Her father, Henry B. Blackwell, was an abolitionist and practically the only man who really devoted his life to obtaining equal rights for women. One of Miss Blackwell’s aunts, Elizabeth Blackwell, was the first woman to take a medical degree, and another, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, was the first woman to be ordained a minister. Miss Blackwell was graduated from Boston University in 1881, and then joined her parents in working for suffrage and in publishing the Woman’s Journal, carrying the paper on alone after their death until 1917 when it became the Woman Citizen. For many years she appeared annually before the committee of the Massachusetts Legislature to answer the anti-suffrage arguments, and a distinguished lawyer once said he considered her rebuttals the ablest presentations of controversial matter he had ever heard. It was also Miss Blackwell who brought together the two parties of the suffrage movement, whose estrangement weakened them in 1890 into the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association, of which she was secretary for nearly 20 years. For years she has been a trustee of Boston University and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Close to her heart is the cause of the Armenians. She has rendered into English a volume of Armenian poems, as well as one of Russian poems a volume of Yiddish verse, and one, still unpublished, of Mexican and South American poetry. Her biography of Catherine Breshkovsky, “The Little Grandmother of the Russian Revolution,” was at one time one of the “six best sellers.”

Y BUILT WATCH

Accuracy Has Become a World Standard

There are nearly two hundred parts in a Waltham watch. Each part has been developed with amazing accuracy. In many instances, the Waltham watch factory has been the scene of scientific invention.

The hairspring is the heart of the watch, yet its performance to timekeeping is relatively unknown. Waltham also created an original process for hardening and tempering the hairspring in form.

This positively means that the Waltham hairspring is superior to that used by any other watch manufacturer.

The Waltham watch presents you with many other factors of accuracy. It is a watch you can depend upon. It is a watch in which you can have a just pride. With good care it will last a lifetime and its upkeep cost is less than that of any other make.
