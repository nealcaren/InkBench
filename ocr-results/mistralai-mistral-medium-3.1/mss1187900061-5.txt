Washington D.C.
July 15. 1883.

Dear Grandpa,

We received your affectionate letter on the
12th, and we were very glad to hear from you, and to know
that you are getting along nicely.

Everything is passing along smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times almost intolerable. It is now
about nine o'clock and the thermometer stands about 84 1/2.

Charlie has not left yet for the Eastern Shore, and
I doubt whether he will or not; I think the latter as
I do not hear him say any-
