No fear dupgess
My dear Sa

I ran off the rest of the journey,
on my way I read your speech. I thought I
heard you but it pleased me so much, I
had more business with it as I read it;
last night I read it to my father, he
was much pleased & united with me
in pronouncing it Able. You showed
cleverness throughout the country, it will
do much good.

Very truly
C. B. Smith
