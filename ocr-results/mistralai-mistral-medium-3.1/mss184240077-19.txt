dear pour quite a little
hour." once more.
Car says "oh!" I hope
so too, & give thee my dear
love, & my love to Miss
Lucie."
   I wished I might
strike up if I were up to it,
write thee a line
in a telegram tomorrow -
my love to thee, & a dear
embrace & my very whole
heart to my mammie
from
her fine weather ought
to do her good.
