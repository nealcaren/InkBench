"Sentimentalisms"? On what
ground the Kenneth Rayners, &
the members of the press expend
their eloquence?

If we press Mrs. Miller & her
steamboat, Mr. Douglass & his wife
into the compound of a syphilogist,
& prove logically that "United
States citizens" have a right
to choose their own mates & employment,
half the writing &
speaking in this northern or western
country as to class privileges
might be ended. I should
like to see the day when in the dispens-
ation of human rights exact & equal
justice will be secured to all
without distinction of race or sex.
With my kind regards to your
wife, I am, my best wishes for
your happiness,
very sincerely yours,
Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
