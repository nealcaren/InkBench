My dear Miss Dickinson

That your brother has been here
upset many considerations which have
been before a court of much regret, yet
I trust that the impropriety there-
in rest at all or with me. My position is one
of reception to the presidential chair
in an election among a city of patriotic men,
and other persons in the city; and I consider it
as being a public institution
at the request of your brother the city has
larger issues upon it in every respect to
make a lathe[?] gift of
which was to be used for public
use by our fellow citizens.

For the very kind consideration which
you expressed my delay in expressing
my feelings I must ask your indulgence of a lathe[?]
which I have known the use of for a
number of years before since these men
were elected. The fact, undoubtedly, was
to, as I hear them, was known to me, as
I have been here known to defend
the life of any citizen at all times, and
which, as I hear, you delivered last
evening, and at which delivering I was at -
meeting at [?].
