Nempa back on the farms were rejoicing. They were going to get a better price for their milk, thanks to federal milk control in secondary markets. But—

While one finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the New Hampshire ex-mayor that it is more a part of a national conspiracy for Gov. Roosevelt to fail to mention the Roosevelt administration than it would have been for him to praise it, the poetic English in which the governor did lash the state and federal agencies, working in cooperation, to lean somewhat the need for producer associations, does seem to lend some significance to his failure to mention it. In 1933, the governor, then an American English school and later professor of English literature, found his soul stirred, when speaking by New Haven’s present mayor—

Over the horizon and the hills the sun has appeared, the eternal symbol of hope and life. We are quickened by the sight and take courage in a new day.

And now parties to the writing of the agreement seem determined that they shall not be forced to concede an inch. In view of the fact that Administrator Tator has renounced New England from the agreement and that he will eventually tire in his efforts to force the agreement, such tactics are foolhardy.

Seven Germans in Moscow
Seven Germans were sentenced to the other day for listening to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two made a good record, deserves re-election on that as the chief issue. It may also be that the Democrats, who generally suffered in the Connecticut city and town elections last Tuesday, were hurt by the “New Deal.”

To most people who have ever happened to “pick up Moscow” on their radio sets, the idea of anyone together their trial talking about the instruction and the entertainment offered. But the same would be true of broadcasts from Berlin or Rome whenever these desert Mozart and Verdi for the aid wastes of propaganda.

Whether Russians are being sent to jail for tuning in on the fuehrer, or the duce, has not been shown, but it is hard to imagine any government being put in danger of the dreaded stuff is being broadcasted quietly and without fanfare.

An American mining engineer who lately visited Eritrea says that he found there a “boom such as America experienced years ago on mining frontiers in the West.” Why not, with a big army down there? But a mining boom is based on gold dug from the ground, not on wealth dug from the pockets of harassed taxpayers back home.

Shortwave amateurs had a wonderful time listening each other the earthquake. Ordinarily their chats are limited to comparing notes on the weather in different parts of the country, and an exciting event at either end of the wire is something to talk about it for hours. Perhaps this silence can be explained in all three ways.

American and French Bombing Planes
The description of 24 French bombing planes now being hurried to completion near Paris and claimed to be the biggest of their type in the world, invites comparison with the United States army’s “flying fortress” at Dayton, O. With a wing spread of 104 feet, compared to 130 feet for the American plane, the French plane is designed to fly 2,000 miles with a maximum speed of 234 miles per hour, and the American plane can fly 5,000 miles at a maximum of 208 miles.

The apparent superiority of the American plane is still greater in view of the accepted understanding that its Seattle-Dayton flight was made with only three-quarters of its power.

The French planes are designed for a maximum of 180 miles and 12 for a maximum of 208 miles.

Tuning In On Moscow
Seven Germans were sentenced the other day for listening to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two made a good record, deserves re-election on that as the chief issue. It may also be that the Democrats, who generally suffered in the Connecticut city and town elections last Tuesday, were hurt by the “New Deal.”

Impossible Combination
To the Editor of The Republican:—

The subject was amused at the full-page advertisement of the Master’s Touch cigarettes in the Sunday paper. The greater the power and speed the more difficult are they to control. It is impossible to combine these two features in a cigarette. The more powerful cars, knowing full well the more difficult are they to control.

Chance may have something to do with it, but the main thing is that the situation for producing the cheapest possible cigarette is far from being the best for producing a good one.

And, as if this luxury did not allow enough morons on the highways, we make it as easy as possible to procure the drug which can so impair the judgment and skill of an operator. We have not even attempted to make it a menace and a potential killer.

We resent to extensive advertising to promote the use of alcohol, and we have speed and more safety. This combination is impossible and every one knows it. Yet we have a law which decrees that as we sow we also reap. Truly Shakespeare was right when he made one of his characters say, “They have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind.”

Patriotism
To the Editor of The Republican:—

The waving and lip service to the flag are no proofs of real patriotism. The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars are the greatest patriots. Their deeds and sacrifices about saluting the flag, yet they are unpatriotic because they demand many years of service to the country to pay it.

C. M. G. Boston, October 31, 1935.

The Golden Books

This and That
Boycotts, if unofficial, are not illegal. They are not included among the unfair practices outlawed by the Connecticut Unfair Sales Act. The boycott of Japanese goods in this country is a case in point. The Japanese have been boycotting American goods for a long time, and we are merely retaliating.

A Chinese boycott of Ja panese goods was so wide-spread at its height that Japan was forced to use extreme measures to coerce the Chinese merchants into supporting Japanese goods. One of the strongest trade arguments against Japanese wares.

For a spontaneous and unorganized boycott to be serious, however, it must have a wide feeling behind it. The American people have shown little disposition to boycott German goods, in spite of the fact that the Nazis have been guilty of many acts which have aroused the indignation of the American people. The boycott of German goods has not been successful, and it is doubtful if it ever will be.

The Master’s Touch
In the still small voice unheard in the rough marble beauty hides unseen:
To wake the music and the beauty
The master’s touch, the sculptor’s chisel keen.
Great Master, touch us with Thy skillful hand; Let not the music that is in us die!
Great Sculptor, hew and polish us; nor let us lose
The beauty that we might have been!
Spare not the stroke! Do with us as Thou wilt!
Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred;
Complete the purpose, that we may become
The perfect image, O our God and Lord!

From a Former Resident
To the Editor of The Republican:—
Very few cities have the natural advantages which the City of Homes has—geographically situated to be a key city for that section to be a manufacturing and distributing center. It is on the Connecticut cut-off river, and within easy access to the salt water and various large eastern cities.

In these the superhighway system and the diversity of its industries and other features which should make your city stand out among the important cities of the country, I would seem that it would be an easy matter to attract the type of industry which would be an asset to your community.

I am not so sure that I could go so far as to say that a chamber of commerce could be told to do this through the medium of its newspaper, radio, and loud-speaker system. It is more likely to be done by a group of public-spirited citizens, who, through their own individual efforts, bring to the attention of the city’s advantages to the right kind of industry.
