shown over and the massive deck. Re-embarking, the visitors gave three cheers for the Naubuc, which were responded to with a hearty good will by the happy crew, who resumed their operations and pastimes.

**Bedloe’s Island.**

Crossing the harbor, the steamer pushed rapidly for Bedloe’s Island, and we were soon ashore for a brief ramble. Col. Chas. S. Merchant, of the regular army, received the ladies, several of whom had resided on the island in the days of hospitals and of battles, when Bedloe’s Island did good service. The stay of the party being very short, they contented themselves with a hasty glimpse of the sea and of the harbor through the upper windows of the Colonel’s fine residence. The Colonel’s family was gratified by the visit and unremitting in attentions. The donations to the garrison and patients on the island consisted of 400 baskets of strawberries, 2 baskets of cherries, 1 box of whortleberries, 2 barrels turnips, 1 barrel beans, 4 quarters lamb, 2 bags peas, 200 head each of cabbage and lettuce, and 50 bunches of radishes and beets. The garrison consists of the Sixty-second New York Regiment, 300 muskets, and the “permanent party,” beside some 30 patients. The hospitals are nearly all empty, and are soon to be pulled down. Everything is in admirable order, and as clean as a pin. Dr. Philip Adolphus, U. S. A., is in charge.

**Fort Lafayette.**

Heading down the harbor our little craft was soon fairly on her way toward Fort Lafayette, which forbidding structure was famous during the war as the prison of those who had committed overt acts of treason against the sovereign power of our government. Passing Staten Island, whose beautiful scenery attracted the eye and refreshed the senses, we kept upon the even tenor of our way, enjoying the cool and bracing sea breeze as it came dancing over the waves, from Sandy Hook. Saluting passing steamers with shrill whistles, waving handkerchiefs to a mail steamship just coming from over the Atlantic, the passengers, no doubt, glad to see fair land and bustling harbor once more, and taking it easy the while, we at last found ourselves at the dock of Fort Lafayette.

Receiving a kind invitation to land, the plank was once more run out, or rather up, and the ladies safely piloted up the perilous ascent. Gaining the interior, we were escorted through the corridor by Lieut. Smith, to the quarters of Brevet Brig.-Gen. Burke, or as he is generally known, “Col. Burke.” The old gentleman was in a very amiable mood, and received his fair visitors in his casement with courtesy and grim politeness.

The garrison consists of the Seventeenth United States Infantry.
