My dear Dr. Catt:

I am enclosing herewith an editorial written by Mr. F.S. Burrage, owner and editor of the Laramie Republican Boomerang. Mr. Burrage opened his paper for the cause of suffrage during the last hectic days and gave unlimited space in his paper to the cause of suffrage, he has quite frequently in the paper expressed his admiration for you in the way in which you have possessed yourself in the great hours of marvelous victory.

Lovingly yours,

Pictorial Review Award

Seventy-Two Years Young.

Not the least interesting part of the story of Mrs. Catt's distinction as winner of the $5,000 Pictorial Review achievement award was the brief statement that she is now in her 72nd year. She certainly is an answer to Dr. Mayo's theory that the mind as well as the body must be kept young.

Where most men and women have retired on their laurels, Mrs. Catt keeps so overwhelmingly abreast of the times that a jury made up of such differing people as Otto H. Kahn the banker, Carl Sandburg the poet; Senator Capper, a newspaper man, and Madame Louise Homer, a singer, have no hesitation in unanimously deciding that in this year, 1930, the American woman to have contributed the most to our national life in letters, arts, science, philanthropy or social welfare, was Mrs. Catt.

Those who had the privilege of becoming acquainted with Mrs. Catt upon the occasion of her Laramie visit are never surprised to learn about the honors that are constantly being showered upon her. But certainly one of the things that impresses most those who are fortunate enough to know her is the fact that she has never allowed herself to be placed on a pedestal. She continues to be a decidedly human sort of person, in touch with life and interested in life. This fact undoubtedly accounts for her youthfulness and in a measure for her achievements.

My dear Dr. Catt:

I rejoice at the recognition which the Pictorial Review through its committee has given my dear friend. I think I am not interested in the sum of money that was your "prize" but the recognition is what intensely pleased me, because to my mind there need have been no contest on this subject at all; you easily could have been chosen by popular vote if there was such a way to handle it. However, it is very fine and I am very happy.

I hope you are quite well and that there may be a few fall flowers in your garden or there may be some trees which have not yet discarded their summer clothing. I trust you are very well.

Lovingly,
