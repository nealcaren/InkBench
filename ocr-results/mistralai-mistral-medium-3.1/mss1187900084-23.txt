That are thoughtful people, at times too, of whom I for
one have the good of the Opinion
once at heart will agree with
you in the soundly Philosophi-
cal view you have taken of
the subject. Let you address
be published in pamphlet
form &, if so, I shall order
some for circulation. This is
not a new or thought-in it
that I would have changed
in any respect. Again I beg to
thank you for laying before the
American people so clearly
and timely an address. I wish
you would send a copy to
our common friend Legare
McKean Lewis Esq. of Phila
He is of the old aboli-
tionists of Pa. of whom his
life and pleasant pursuits
make one or by which he will know
from whom he receives it.
Do come east in the days
should you come to this city
remember you have a cordi-
al friend, who if you follow it
with suit will come to my house
