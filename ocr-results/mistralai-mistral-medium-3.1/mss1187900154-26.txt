Chicago, Ill., June 19th

My dear Mr. Damples:

I leave for the East tomorrow and now I have just offered
long distance to Mrs. Donglass that I shall be unable to do so. Do make my
excuses to her for not being able to. I remember
her with much pleasure in Paris. I hope
to return to Chicago later in the summer and
then I will not fail to see her and both.
In the meanwhile believe me,

Very Cordially,

Theodore Stanton,
26 West 61st St.,
