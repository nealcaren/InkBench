Washington April 10, 1887

Dear Father,

Your letter dated March 24 I received yesterday, it found us all well, and pleased to hear from you.

Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds is seriously sick with pneumonia. Gerrit S. Logan has been appointed Deputy Recorder of Deeds. The Lawyers are much put out about it. Senator Sherman is making a trip South; in Georgia, a colored delegation called at his hotel, and was refused admission, as soon as he heard of it, he paid his bill and went to another hotel. A colored man by the name of Taylor from Kansas has been appointed to the Liberian Commission. The political outlook at present on the Republican side is wavering between Blaine and Sherman. Congress has made an appropriation for a new Bridge across the Eastern Branch at the foot of Penn. Ave. Business in the Recorder's Office is booming. Gus Wald, the President of the Anacostia R.B. is married. Barradoes has been appointed "Commissioner of Deeds." The President and Mr. Mathews have been taken back in the dumped confirmation of Mr. Trotter. They expected he would be rejected. Lawyer
