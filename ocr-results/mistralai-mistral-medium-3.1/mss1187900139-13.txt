Honorable J.G. Blaine,

Sir: I have the honor to
ask the favor of a leave of absence
from PortauPrince, beginning on the
20th of June, extending the time
required to reach Washington and the
return to again reach PortauPrince,
if the latter shall be deemed my duty.

I am required to state in
this request for leave of absence, the
number of days I was absent from
my post, during the preceding year.
I have respectfully complied with this
instruction or rule, by referring you to
my Dispatch No. 95 dated Dec. 18th 1890,
in which it is stated: "I left PortauPrince,
on the 19th July and on the 26th of the
same month, arrived at my home in
the District of Columbia. On the 3rd Oct.
I was fully prepared and expressed to
start on my return to my post
of duty by the steamer leaving New
York on the following day, but only
received instructions from the Department.
