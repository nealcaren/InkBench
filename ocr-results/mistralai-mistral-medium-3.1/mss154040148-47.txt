My dear Mollie:-
  I gave you this piece for a
cable and now is here. I remain
another day but I suspect that progress
is in the direction of frequency and that you
had not cabled at all.
  Mar 27. I was interrupted here and now see
all things are different and time has passed
your cable has been renewed, and it was such
a relief to get it. Imagine you passing through
that discouraging stage when you think you
will never be well again and when life has
lost all its purpose. But keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. I am so glad
you are better. This would indeed be a
black old place without you dear Mollie.
  I expected tomorrow you a note here
because I thought at first it was a good
cable port & would be a good mail
station, but it seems many American
