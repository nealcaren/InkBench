Mr. Belford has been in the city
long enough to hold two meetings. I shall
not accompany him to Belfast or
in any part of Ireland. He will have
the field to himself. I ought to be with them
at Cork, but it will not be in my power.
I am now about to tell you something
which will make you think me the
most fickle of men. I have decided
to stay in this country six months longer
and I should not wonder if Mr. Wright
should do the same - though I am less
with far less reason than I have to
justify me in staying. I have decided
to stay in consequence of the advice both
of Mr. Garrison and Mr. Thompson.
Both think the present a most
favorable opportunity for rousing
the Anti-Slavery feeling of this country
and bringing it to the aid of the true
Anti-Slavery Society in America.
And each think it would be wrong for me
to leave if Mr. Thompson decided to stay.
