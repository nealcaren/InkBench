ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%

"Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race," Berlin Councillor Declares.

AMSTERDAM, Dec. 12 (Associated Press)--Ten per cent of the children born in Prussia are illegitimate, according to statements made in the Prussian House of Representatives by Dr. Engel, the Berlin Town Councillor.

Dr. Engel, in his statement that this large proportion of illegitimates is an evidence of moral healthiness of the German race, said:

"The abolition of all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children, though it may seem, at first sight, to be a great boon, is really a measure of the greatest danger to the morality of our people. In the case of illegitimacy, the idea of the restriction of families, which has been so much emphasized of late, has not yet penetrated the masses.

"The trible fact, however, is that only one out of every 1,000 illegitimates is cared for by its father, compared with 512 in the case of legitimate children. Illegitimacy is a convincing plea for the card system, which would force the fathers of illegitimate children, married mothers and their children, all mothers who were engaged to men who were killed in the war, and women who were about to be married, to register. Under the card system, the title "Frau" would be given to the unmarried mother. Every journey for a food card would be a torture for the immoral mother.

"The card system would offer the possibility of registration and humiliation. In the hard struggle for existence, the unmarried mother, who must again and again make confession in the shop, would, in many cases, prefer to enter the bonds of matrimony.

"The number of unmarried mothers in Berlin at the present time has reached a total of nearly 300,000 yearly.
