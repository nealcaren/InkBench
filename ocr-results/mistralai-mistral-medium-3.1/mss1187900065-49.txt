I join not which I'll send you, and
since its payment by a mortgage on farm
stock, implements & household furniture.
The stock consists of four fine horses, two
fine Alderney Milch Cows, a fine Alderney
bull, 3 heifers, facing team, farm
wagon etc. - The farming tools are
good condition. Farming implements
all required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at private sale for
$8000 and no less since it sold
two years after spring opens, as it is worth
considerably more money.
They owned not alone one ask this
sum of you, but for the absolute certainty
of the security they offer - no one
I do not tell, but for the emergency
of their situation. Should the place
be offered at Mortgage sale, I would
run the sale privately, as you will
see at a glance.
Can you help them? This is how of their
need? If you can write so
inform me, I see no necessity
papers executed & take them to you
any day you may name.
I feel, for Donglass, that
while your claim upon him is nothing
beyond your regard for their mother,
pleading is unnecessary. If you
can do it, I will be deeply grateful
to you & see that you lose in relying them.
Please write me as early as possible
in enclosed envelope.
