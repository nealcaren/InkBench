WOMEN IN COLORADO

When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage

In the legislative session of 1879, when the amendment proposing woman suffrage was submitted to the lawmakers, and passed the house upon them an additional duty. The amendment was submitted to popular vote. John P. Irish endorsed the amendment through the columns of The Tribune, and a long connection with the newspaper and its editor, he was not averse to the experiment being tried. He was not a radical in the cause, but he believed in testing the question.

Mr. Irish was asked if he had changed his mind since the amendment had been submitted to the people, and he said:

"No, sir, I have not. I am not a woman's rights man, but I believe in giving the women the right to vote, and I would have them exercise that right. Women are taxed the same as men, and they should have a voice in the expenditure of the money. Women are more moral than men, and their influence in public affairs would be beneficial. I do not believe that women will ever vote in as large proportion as men, but I believe that if they had the right to vote, they would vote for the best interests of the community."

In A SECOND SPEECH

Mr. Irish—(am requested by the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Ball) to answer the question as to whether I would vote for the amendment if I were in the legislature today. I would. I would vote for it, because I believe that the women are as competent to vote as men. I believe that they are as much interested in the welfare of the state as men, and I believe that their influence would be beneficial. I believe that they would vote for the best interests of the community, and I believe that they would vote for the best men. I believe that they would vote for the men who would make the best laws, and I believe that they would vote for the men who would spend the money in the best manner. I believe in woman suffrage, and I would vote for it if I were in the legislature today.)

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY

Some Iowa newspapermen carry the erroneous impression that the special law enforcement agents are appointed by the attorney general of the state. This is not the fact. The governor is the appointing power. The law was enacted in 1896, and the first man to be appointed was A. R. McCord of Des Moines, who was made a special agent to enforce the laws against the illegal sale of intoxicating liquors. The law was amended in 1901, so as to include the enforcement of all laws, and since that time the governor has appointed special agents to enforce the law. The law was again amended in 1909, so as to provide for the appointment of special agents by the attorney general, but the supreme court held that the law was unconstitutional, and that the governor was the appointing power.

THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE

The Tribune recently asked the editors of the Chicago Tribune, "Why did not Washington and Madison and Jefferson and Hamilton and the constitution makers meet the situation and give this country an army and navy at the start?" The Tribune comes back with the answer that the men who made the constitution were not fools. They knew that the great danger to the new republic was in the establishment of a military despotism. They knew that armies and navies are the tools of tyrants, and they knew that the great mass of the American people were opposed to the maintenance of military establishments. They knew that the people would not have consented to the establishment of a military despotism, and they knew that the people would not be willing to pay the taxes to maintain a military establishment. They knew that the only way to insure the perpetuation of the republic was to keep the military power subordinate to the civil power. They knew that the only way to insure the perpetuation of the republic was to keep the military establishment as small as possible. The fathers were wise in their generation. They knew that the only way to insure the perpetuation of the republic was to keep the military establishment as small as possible. They knew that the only way to insure the perpetuation of the republic was to keep the military establishment as small as possible.

MR. IRISH GROWING OLD

Nothing is sadder this world than the change that comes over some men as they grow old. They lose their enthusiasm for the views and alarm dependency of age.

I do not know of an illustration more to the point than the speeches which were made in the Iowa legislature when the women of the state were asking for the right of suffrage. John P. Irish was a forward looker in those days, and was among the first to espouse the cause of equal suffrage. He was a member of the legislature at the time when the women of the state were asking for the right of suffrage, and he made a speech in favor of the amendment. He was a member of the legislature in 1870, and he favored the amendment. He was a member of the legislature in 1879, and he favored the amendment.

PRIVATE BRANCH TELEPHONE EXCHANGE

Washington, May 23.—A private branch telephone exchange which has been in operation here for some time, but which only to-day was brought to light, has been suppressed by the postoffice department. The exchange was a scheme to beat the government out of its tolls. It was operated by the Western Electric company, and was located at 1212 New York avenue, in the heart of the retail district.

The exchange was installed for the accommodation of a number of merchants, who were thus enabled to talk to each other over their private wires without paying tolls to the government. The suppression of the exchange was ordered by Third Assistant Postmaster General John H. Connelly, who said that the operation of the exchange was a violation of the government's franchise.
