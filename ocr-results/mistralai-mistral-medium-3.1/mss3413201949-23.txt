(1) The Senseless Waste of War.
When the great war began 47 billions gold War debt-
ood took the bosom of Europe. The total coin money
in circulation in the whole world was about
eleven billions of dollars. Yet the nations plunged
all well into the war, borrowing all they could
not stopping to count the printing paper money.
At the end the international debts were so
great that a universal panic
complicated and burdensome that a universal panic
followed. What senseless waste! Any wonder they
can not pay their debts to us?
Do you know that every man killed in the late
war cost the living $17800?
Let me read from "Little Dialogue", an extract from
a conversation between a king like Prime Minister,
Cyness - Pyrrhus
in the 3rd century before Christ.

(2) When are the people so Will(ing)
When the generation that has not experienced
war ceases to hear the tread of the glorious war
but know the facts refuse to repeat such
history - when women refuse the glamour of
war trappings, war music, war propaganda
and take intelligent stand in elections.
