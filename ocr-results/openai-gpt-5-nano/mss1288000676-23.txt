I can transcribe this page, but the right-hand column is quite small and the text is densely printed, so some parts are not fully legible at this resolution. Below is a best-effort transcript of the clearly readable portions, with unclear sections marked as [illegible].

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to obtain a medical degree and another aunt was the first to become a minister; her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college; became a lecturer against Negro slavery and for women’s rights when more public speaking by women was considered indecency; and throughout her life was one of the most influential leaders of the woman’s movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to the woman’s cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from babyhood in the widely varied activities of her parents, which Miss Blackwell has recorded in her book “Lucy Stone,” Pioneer of Women’s Rights. Miss Blackwell was assistant and editor of the Woman’s Journal for about thirty-eight years; Secretary of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association for about twenty years; and President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. As Miss Blackwell’s chief weapon was the pen, often anonymous, she was not personally in the public eye as much as the platform speakers. But her work of editing and writing for that cause was a powerful influence in the movement.

The atrocious oppressions of the Czars’ government led her to active work with the American Friends of Russian Freedom. Her work for this organization extended over many years and included editorial and communicative efforts in a variety of forms.

Notwithstanding these grave activities, Miss Blackwell remained actively engaged in broader humanitarian and educational efforts, and her influence in the suffrage movement and in international causes continued to be felt for many years.
