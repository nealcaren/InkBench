I can transcribe what is legible and mark the uncertain parts. The image shows a formal letterhead in Romanian (Liga Drepturilor si Datorilor Femei) with a handwritten English-language letter appended beneath. Below is the transcription with unclear portions indicated.

Handwritten letter (English text; every line is as legible as possible)

Dear Mrs Chapman Catt,

We are in our program of this year to read lectures on “famous women.” We [illegible] … [text unclear] and I will do it, she in the L. J. F. and I [illegible] [text unclear] popular evening courses. But as there are no complete libraries in Romania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books, necessary for preparation. Teachers therefore to you as to the other sections of ? to ask your help.

Feeling so much the lips of a few libraries we will try at one time with our studies, to found one at B., and perhaps you shall be able to assemble around it the women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time.

Will you [illegible] me the generous act of your [illegible] and to send us one of the standard works on the women’s movement in your country and especially biographies of your famous women.

We would yearn in a first series of lectures, on public and social [illegible], and [illegible] one or the other standard works.

[End of legible portion – several lines are cut off or heavily faded]

Notes:
- Several names, addresses, and phrases in the header are not fully legible in the image; I have indicated likely forms where readable.
- The body contains multiple legible phrases (e.g., “Dear Mrs Chapman Catt,” “we are in our program of this year to read lectures on … [famous women],” “there are no complete libraries in Romania and not a single feminist library,” “it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books, necessary for preparation,” “we would [ask] your help,” “around it the women in a club,” and “send us one of the standard works on the women’s movement in your country and biographies of your famous women”). The rest is too faded or run together to read with certainty and is marked as [illegible] where appropriate.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or specify the exact spots you’d like me to focus on, I can refine the transcription and fill in more of the illegible sections.
