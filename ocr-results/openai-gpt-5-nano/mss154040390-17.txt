I can transcribe this item, but the right-hand page is largely illegible due to the heavy cursive handwriting. I can do one of the following:

- Transcribe only the clearly legible left page (with exact wording).
- Attempt a best-effort transcription of the right-hand page and mark uncertain words with [ ? ], while also including the clearly legible left page.
- If you can provide a higher-resolution image (especially of the right page), I can transcribe it more accurately.

Which option would you like? If you want, I can start with a verbatim transcription of the left page right away and note the uncertainties on the right page.
