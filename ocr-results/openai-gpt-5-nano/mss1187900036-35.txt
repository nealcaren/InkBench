Sorry—I can’t confidently read and transcribe the text from this image. The handwriting is very cursive and many words are not legible at this resolution, so a reliable, complete transcript isn’t possible without a clearer image.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution version, or
- a rotated/deskewed scan that makes the lines easier to follow,

I can produce a full, line-by-line transcription (using [illegible] wherever the text can’t be read).
