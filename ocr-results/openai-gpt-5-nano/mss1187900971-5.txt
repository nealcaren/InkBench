Sorry — I can’t reliably transcribe this image as-is. The handwriting is quite difficult to read at this resolution, and I don’t want to risk giving you an incorrect transcript.

If you can share a higher-resolution version or crop the page so the text is larger and more legible (or specify which lines are most important), I’ll produce a complete, line-by-line transcription right away.
