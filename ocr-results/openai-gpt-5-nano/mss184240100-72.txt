I’m happy to transcribe, but this image is too illegible for a confident, complete transcription right now. The handwriting is very dense and there are cross-writings on the margins, which makes many words uncertain.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution image, or
- a cropped, close-up of the page (especially the right-hand column and the marginal/top lines),
I’ll produce a precise, line-by-line transcription (including marginal notes and cross-writing), marking any unclear words with [?] as needed.

Would you upload a sharper shot of this page (or send the page in a few clearer crops)? I’llcomplete the full transcript as soon as I can read the text more clearly.
