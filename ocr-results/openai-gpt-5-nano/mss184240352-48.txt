I’m having trouble reading the text clearly from this image (the page is rotated and several words are faint). To provide an accurate, complete transcript I need a higher-resolution image or it rotated to a readable orientation (for example, rotated 90° clockwise so the lines run left-to-right).

If you can supply:
- A higher-res version, or
- A rotated version (so the text is horizontal),

I’ll deliver a full, line-by-line transcription with illegible parts marked as [?].
