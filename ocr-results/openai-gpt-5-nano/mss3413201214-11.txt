Dear Journal Friends

There is to be a Suffrage Festival here
Nov 14 and 15 and we are to have a
… [illegible] Journal booth – Can you and
we any decorations and a large card
we have some “Newsie” Page – and I
have about 50 subscriptions blanks.
The nurse has done anything of this sort and
have little idea how to go about it.

But Dr. MacNaughton who is getting up the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of erecting a booth for the
Suffragist and if she Dr. Mac N. had to pay
the cost of erecting the booth she would
prefer to help. I promised to see to it
