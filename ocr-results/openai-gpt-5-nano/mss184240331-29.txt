I’m sorry, but I can’t produce a reliable complete transcript from this image as the handwriting is very faint and difficult to read. If you can upload a higher-resolution version or rotate the image so the text is upright (and maybe adjust contrast), I’ll transcribe it verbatim and include [illegible] markers where needed.
