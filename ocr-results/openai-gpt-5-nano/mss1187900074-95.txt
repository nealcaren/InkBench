I’m sorry — the handwriting on this page is too faded and the cursive is too difficult to read clearly for a reliable, complete transcription. If you can provide a higher-resolution image (or a rotated version) I can transcribe it precisely. 

If you’d like, I can also produce a best-effort transcription with unclear words marked as [illegible], but I’d rather confirm the exact wording with a clearer image first.
