Sorry — I can’t reliably read the handwriting in this image to provide a complete transcript. The page is quite small and the cursive is dense, so many words are not legible enough to transcribe accurately.

If you can upload a higher-resolution scan or a clearer photo (preferably 300–600 dpi), I’ll transcribe the entire item exactly as written. 

If you’d like, I can also attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for the uncertain parts right now, but I’d prefer a clearer image to ensure accuracy.
