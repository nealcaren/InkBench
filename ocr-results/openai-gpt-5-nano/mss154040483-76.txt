I can transcribe the page, but parts of the text are faint and not fully legible. Here is a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers where I cannot confirm the exact wording from the image.

Whose Government is This?
By Carrie Chapman Catt

THE question for our consideration is whether the department of Election Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it a part of the work of the League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less appealing to many women, but for that very reason it is more necessary for women voters to comprehend its need.

If any other department of the League should be dropped, for example, Women in Industry, Social Hygiene, Child Welfare, other organizations would be responsible for the necessary work to be done, as they were before these departments were adopted by the League of Women Voters; but if the political department be dropped there is no other body of women to take it up.

We were enfranchised in 1920. We ought to have been enfranchised twenty years earlier, but that is not the reason why we were not enfranchised long before some of us were old enough to take an interest in this question. The problem before us is to determine how the League can best handle the work of Election Laws and Methods in the light of our general program and aims.

Controlling Groups

A small group of people determined to oppose promised legislation, if provided with money, as were the brewers and distillers, may hold back legislation and prevent action being taken, even though the masses of the people demand that action be taken. What the wets did to the suffrage amendments may be repeated if the League fails to organize public opinion effectively.

[Several lines of text here are illegible in the image. The following paragraphs are partially visible:]

A system in this country for taking the vote ... (illegible) the League to do its part ... (illegible) the next step in the campaign. There is also the autocracy of what is known as the boss system to be watched. In one of the states which did not ratify there were men who did not accept the vote as the right of the people.

Where We Need Reform

Perhaps we need it most in our platform making. Ours is a country governed by party lines, and the platform must reflect the will of the people. The ballot must be made to bear the messages of the voters clearly, and the government must be held to its promises.

There are three main reasons for this proposed reform. First, we must champion the rights of the citizen in the selection and accountability of government. Second, we must simplify and improve the machinery of elections to prevent corruption and inefficiency. Third, we must educate voters to understand the issues and the processes by which they are decided. (illegible)

These were two questions only in that campaign, and there were many others. So difficult was it for women to register the opinions they wanted to express in that election that very many of them felt the vote would never be one they could use to advantage. (illegible)

The text continues beyond what is legible in this image, including discussion of reform, the role of the League, and related topics.

If you’d like, I can try again with a higher-resolution scan or crop to improve legibility, and I’ll produce a fuller, more accurate transcription with fewer [illegible] gaps.
