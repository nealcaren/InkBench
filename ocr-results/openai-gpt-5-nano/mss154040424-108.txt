I’m sorry — the image is not clear enough for a confident, complete transcription. I can read parts of the right-hand page, but there are many scrawls, insertions, and cross-outs that are not legible enough to transcribe accurately without guessing. If you can provide a higher‑resolution image (or separate pages) I can produce a full, exact transcript.

In the meantime, here is the best-possible transcription of the clearly legible parts from the right-hand page, with uncertain portions marked:

If you can share a sharper copy or two separate pages, I’ll provide a complete verbatim transcript with all cross-outs and marginalia preserved.
