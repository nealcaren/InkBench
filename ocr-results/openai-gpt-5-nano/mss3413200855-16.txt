I will give mother fifty- 
I have a feeling that I did not send my check to the Cambridge League for the National League. I am enclosing a check for [amount unclear], if I have already paid will you destroy this check. My own such books are in Cambridge so I cannot work it up. 

I hope Mrs. has been getting some rain, enough to keep down the forest fires but not been deluged as we have been,

it has rained almost incessantly since early day; from the first to Nineteenth of June we had fifteen days of rain. Will probably be home by the middle of July and will come to learn the amount of the fund. 

Very cordially
Zara Lee Bot
