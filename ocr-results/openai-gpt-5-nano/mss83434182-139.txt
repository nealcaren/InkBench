I can read the header and column structure, but the individual rows are not legible enough to transcribe accurately from this image. Here is what I can clearly read:

- Page number: 134
- Title on the page: UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN
- Left margin label: BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINAâ€”Continued
- Column headings (left to right): 
  - No.
  - Name
  - Rank
  - Co.
  - Reg't.
  - Grave
  - Date of death
  - Remarks

The rows containing the soldier names, units, and death details are not legible enough to transcribe precisely from this image. If you can provide a higher-resolution version or a cropped area focusing on the table, I can provide a complete line-by-line transcription.
