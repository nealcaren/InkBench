Here is my best effort at a complete transcription of the legible text. Some portions are very faint and I’ve marked uncertain parts with [illegible].

Top margin / header (very faint)
- HQ? 67 USC
- Port Hudson July 7, 1861

Main body (right-hand page)
- Turn over at once and supply
- Ordnance —

Right-hand margin (vertical note, faint)
- Doc 621854? Port Hudson July 7, 1861

Left margin (vertical lines are faint and partially illegible)
- [illegible text running vertically; appears to be brief directives or notes related to the main instruction above]

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a scan with a bit more contrast, I can attempt to read and complete the uncertain portions more accurately.
