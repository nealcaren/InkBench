I’m sorry — I can’t produce a reliable, complete transcription from this image. The handwriting is too faint and several words are not legible, even with careful inspection.

If you can provide a higher‑resolution version or a crop with better contrast (or both), I can attempt the transcription again and mark clearly any uncertain sections with [illegible].
