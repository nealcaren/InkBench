I’m sorry — the handwriting in this image is too faint in many places for me to produce a reliable, complete transcript. Several words are illegible, and I don’t want to guess inaccurately.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image (or a cropped version that focuses on the text), I can give you a precise, line-by-line transcription with unclear words marked as [illegible].
