THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
FOR THE
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

Headquarters, Fourteenth Avenue or 22nd Street
New York January 26, 1885

To The Probate Judge of Hudson County, N.J.

I herewith enclose the Last Will and Testament of Miss Ottilia [illegible] who died, as I am informed in the City of Paris, France, August 21st 1884. I have decided not to offer the same for probate, because I do not propose to qualify as executor, but, in view of the fact of other persons having interests in the estate, under the Will in question, I deem it my duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to your entertaining an application for administration on the estate, with the Will annexed.

Please state, however, that it is the intention of The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on the trusts mentioned in the Will, to claim the property to which it is entitled.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect,
[Signature]
Henry Bergh
President
