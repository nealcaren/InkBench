My dear Douglass:

On my passage thro’ New York yesterday from Philad. There I spoke on Friday evening, I called at Ken- hood & Co’s office for news about the sailing of our steamers. And this is what the clerk in the office assured me of:

The steamer is the “Orange Nassau.”

She will sail from Pierport Stores (along side of the Wall street ferry), Brooklyn, on Friday next, 4th instant, at noon, for Port au Prince.

I presume that we can count on their information as entirely reliable.

I have always understood that the “Orange Nassau” is the poorest steamer of the line. But she is [illegible] and worn and [illegible], and fares we can count on for his days on board of the line.
