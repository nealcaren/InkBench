My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to congratulate the world upon having you in it in all these eighty years to inspire and lead humanity to do the best to advance freedom and civilization.

You have been a recognized thinker and leader in many fields where men and women are proud to follow. My only regret is that the United States has not yet had the courage to elect a woman to the office of president. You have been my candidate for that place for many years. How proudly we should all have campaigned for you!

It is impossible to express adequately our appreciation of all you have done for men and women of the whole world.

It has been a great privilege and joy to work in the ranks with you so wisely at the head.

We all in this household wish you a very Happy Birthday with deep gratitude and congratulations.

Affectionately,

Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,

My dear Mrs. Johnson,

[As a sealed-deliver?] letter from Mrs. Stanton just received, requests that I write you the answer to some questions that she has asked us that you will receive this letter before your meeting on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place, present, which to place its collection when it gets it and must raise money which to provide a place for and for maintenance; because it could guarantee to provide this to my library and that of the National Suffrage Association I have arranged to place this collection with the Congressional Library and that they have pledged that this collection will be kept intact for twenty-five years. Very many books, of small importance, will accompany by that time [illegible].

The Congressional Library is [ ? ] interested in books, but at the Smithsonian we already have [ ? ]. They are just completing a large addition to their building and are not cramped for space. I have told the Women’s Archives Committee that my collection will go to Washington.

The Congressional Library is [ ? ] interested in books, but at the Smithsonian [ ? ]. I have written to Alice Stone Blackwell that we have no record of Lucy Stone there and that it is very important that she should be included. The Smithsonian is not only interested in books, but in [ ? ] objects, and I have some memoranda that I will add to these already there. In addition to these I have put together a personal collection of photographs [ ? ] the suffrage movement and the leaders [ ? ]. The [ ? ] of pamphlets and [ ? ] will be included.

Hastily,

Carrie E. Catt
