OFFICE OF
G. B. BARNES,
SECRETARY OF THE
REPUBLICAN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,
OF RANDOLPH COUNTY.

Cuthbert, Ga., 189

Printed [G?iven] Your [minds] for the Cause, I wish you would send me one of them [named] [Douglass], and I wish you to do me this favor as I have spent a great deal of money this year for the Republican Cause, and is now greatly in doubt for the same. And the Republican [Committee] [has] sent a [petition] to Mr. [Granamann?] Postmaster to the Postoffice at this place (Cuthbert, Ga). This will help me to secure my home for the money spent for the party.
