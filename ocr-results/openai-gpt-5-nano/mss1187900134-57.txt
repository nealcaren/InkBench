Dear Madam,â€”

We enclose sketches for the order you so kindly gave us August 31st. The ones marked #1 and #2, you can have your choice of as agreed upon in our contract. The letters are to be round raised letters, and the rosettes are to be the bronze work that you selected in our office. We enclose a regular form of contract, and if you decide that either design #1 or #2 is satisfactory to you, you can sign on the bottom line of both contracts, and return them to me, and I will sign them and return one to you.

We also send a design marked #3, with two very handsome leaves made in bronze, and applied to the granite in the same way as we do the rosettes. If this should suit you better than the other tablets, You can sign the contracts with the clause for #3 design, and return them all to us, and we will sign them and return one to you.

We appreciate very much the placing of this order in our hands, and we shall take pride in executing it in the very finest way, and making it entirely satisfactory to you.

Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain

Yours respectfully, J. Weston
