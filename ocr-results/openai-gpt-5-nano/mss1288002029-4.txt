I’m having trouble reading the text in this image clearly enough to provide an accurate, complete transcript. The clipping is small and the print is faint, so many words are illegible.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution version, or
- a cropped image that focuses on the clipping (without the surrounding page),
I can transcribe it exactly.

In the meantime, I can attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for uncertain words if you’d like. Would you prefer that?
