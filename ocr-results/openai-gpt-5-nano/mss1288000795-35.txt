I’m unable to confidently read the handwritten text in this image. The script is quite faint and several words are unclear, so a reliable full transcription isn’t possible from this view.

If you’d like, I can provide a best-effort transcription with unclear words marked as [illegible], or you can upload a higher‑resolution version (better contrast, or a direct crop of the text) and I’ll transcribe it verbatim. Which would you prefer?
