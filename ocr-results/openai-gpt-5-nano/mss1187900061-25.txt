Sorry — this image is quite faint and a number of words are not legible enough for a reliable full transcript. I can provide a best-effort transcription of the clearly readable parts and mark the unclear sections with [illegible]. If you can upload a higher-resolution version, I can produce a more exact transcription.

Best-effort transcription (with unclear parts marked):

Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 25, 18[illegible].

Honorable
H. H. Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass!

[illegible text] speech delivered at the session commemoration of Emancipation in the District of Columbia and [illegible] particularly [illegible] by your Excellency [illegible] [illegible] and [illegible] at the request [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] a half century in the [illegible] case and [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] for near [illegible] a half century in the [illegible] sense of [illegible] [illegible] [illegible].

If you can share a sharper image or a crop of just the text area, I’ll re-run the transcription and fill in the [illegible] parts precisely.
