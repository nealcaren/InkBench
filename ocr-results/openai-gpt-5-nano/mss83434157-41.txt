I can transcribe the clearly legible parts, but much of the page is too faint to read with confidence. Here is what I can make out exactly, with uncertain portions marked:

- No. 40.
- SPECIAL PUBLICATION.
- 1865
- [illegible signature line / handwritten text across the right side]

The rest of the text is too faded or obscured to decipher accurately. If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped close-up of the right-hand area, I can attempt a more complete transcription.
