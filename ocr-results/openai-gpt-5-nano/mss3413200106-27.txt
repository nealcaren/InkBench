Dear Miss Blackwell,

I am blessed with a [propensity] to be always at something. [You] are something, still you will not [dare] an illogical conclusion, as three successive [epistles] might tempt a less [reasonable] creature to do. The truth is, [it's] hot, hot beyond [cred], to say nothing of [dead]. What resource else was left but you. The other evening, so it was spoken to me as having done this and that as nurse in the war. I was called on to admire her. I should to say, [I admire] what she did. But must she not be a noble woman to do so much. When I said it [my] will for me you and she and I, to some good. He [the] only recommendation we can have? But really I [look] to see one who [needs] me. seeing whom one thinks not how much he has done or can do, but how much he is.

I [preface] to say I was talking Greek, and not [no] further; but you who understands Greek is [this] really so [minutely].
