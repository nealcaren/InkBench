I’m unable to provide a reliable, complete transcription from this image. The text is faint and difficult to read, especially the handwriting. If you can provide a higher-resolution version or a cropped close-up of the area with the text, I’ll transcribe it exactly, including any uncertain parts as [?]. 

If you want, I can at least note what is legible now:
- The page shows a heading that appears to read “ABSTRACT I.” and “No. 41.” (vertical orientation scrolling).
- There is a handwritten portion, and a year that seems like “1865,” but the rest of the handwriting is too faint to decipher accurately.

Please share a clearer image or specify a region to zoom in on, and I’ll produce a complete transcription.
