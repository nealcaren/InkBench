Here is a best-effort transcription of the two-page item. Some portions are faint or partially legible in the image; where text is unclear, I’ve marked it with [illegible] or [unclear].

John continued giving concerts as long as there were any brothers‑in‑law, sisters‑in‑law or neighbors to sing with him, and finally, he gave one when his little girl was five years old. She sang The Yankee Boy.

All these things have been highly amusing to me. What has become of them all I do not know, but one brother lost his wife and five children and then died himself. Perhaps they were all taken off in that way. They certainly were a great family and most entertaining.

I hope you are well and enjoying life.

Lovingly,

Boston, Mass.

My dear Miss Blackwell:

I am sorry to trouble you again about that annuity.  
The annuity has gone through and yet there remains something  
to do.

I enclose a paper which they ask both you and me to  
sign. You must have a witness, but not a notary, so any one  
will do.

I could tell the Insurance Company to send the checks to me and they would do it, but all insurance companies have a rule that any check must be endorsed by the actual person receiving the money; therefore, when two people are the beneficiaries of an annuity, the check if not otherwise agreed. Every check, therefore, would have to be sent over to Boston for your endorsement and sent back to me for deposit, hence the necessity for getting authority to have all the checks sent to me.

The annuity has gone through and I have the policy.  
I deposited with the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, [illegible] and received annual [illegible].  

The total income from the [illegible] is [illegible] per year.  
It is my intention to divide that equally with you. You will, therefore, receive [illegible] each year for your life. I thought [illegible] particular method would make the division for you more clear. The first payment will be made on [illegible] and will be sent to you. I shall then [rest of sentence unclear].

Notes:
- The right-hand page includes the date and address at the top, beginning with Miss Alice Stone Blackwell and continuing with the business about the annuity. Some numbers and words are not clearly legible in the image; I’ve marked those with [illegible].
- The text on the left page flows into the right page (the right page begins mid-sentence with “carry her out of life at once.”), so this transcription treats the two pages as a continuous letter.
- If you can provide a higher‑resolution image or a zoomed-in section for the garbled segments, I can fill in the missing words more precisely.
