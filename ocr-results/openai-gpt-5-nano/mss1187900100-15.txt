Bailey, Tenn. Nov. 9th 1861

Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement afoot here to move three thousand families out West. We are trying & making every effort to get up the money. In the name of God we call upon you to assist us & get us friends to assist; now this voice comes directly from the cabins of the poor oppressed down to the remotest Southern Negroes & if the northern people refuse to help us we are dead men without a hope. All we want is to get away from our oppressors & there we can educate our children. We have sent out several letters to remote friends & we ask you to do the same in behalf of poor suffering humanity. For reference of writer address H. B. Eaton, Memphis, Tenn., & P. Matt Bailey, Jr. 

Yours Very Truly, C. L. McComb Sec.
