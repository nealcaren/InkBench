I know not where to find justice for them; I appeal to your judgement; I have ever been friendly to the colored race, having lived many years at Cape Hayti in the Island of Hayti, where my husband keeps a permanent commercial house under the name of Wilson, Lasoche & Co; We are well known to the present President of Hayti, as you know he was interested in the purchase of Coffee for the house of Wilton, Lasoche & Co; One Wilson was also known for the United States, and there recognition of Hayti was effected. Be so kind as to write for us to influence public opinions in the eyes of the colored people. Begging you to cause me to address you I remain
Very Respectfully,
Frances L. Wilson
