I’m not able to produce a reliable complete transcript from this image. The page text is too small and faint for accurate transcription, especially the individual names and details in the table.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image (or a cropped image focusing on the table with better contrast), I can transcribe the entire item precisely. Alternatively, I can transcribe the clearly readable header and column headings now and mark the uncertain parts with [illegible], but that wouldn’t be a complete, faithful transcript of the full page.
