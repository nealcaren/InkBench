Dear Sir

I am an Ex Union Soldier and
have endeavored to be a con-
stant Republican ever since
the organization of that party.
I have resided in the South a
greater portion of the time
since the Civil War and in
very humble sphere in life
have been a friend to the
colored race. It certainly seems
to me that the curse of absolute
slavery is still rests upon this
country and bears heavily
upon the colored race. I reside
at present in the country and
bear the utmost respect for your
principles and efforts toward
the advancement of the colored
people.
