man has equaled in the past and now
can hope to exceed in the future.

Our dwer the obligations end with the race,
the whole nation has reason to be grateful
for the large and lofty example of
patriotism given in the man and so
beautifully and fitly expressed in the oration.

I can only add my individual Thanks
from the depth of my heart for the
strong and true words of wisdom, given
by way of advice to my own people and
for the benefits which will result to each
and all of us because of the Union wide
effect which your oration will have upon
the better portion of the white people of the
country, thinking and hoping that you may
be spared many, many years to instruct
and influence for good this Great American
Nation- I am, my dear friend, most
Gratefully Yours) William H. H. Hart,
