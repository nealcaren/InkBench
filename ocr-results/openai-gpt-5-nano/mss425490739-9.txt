I can transcribe this, but the image is small and some text is difficult to read. I can provide a best-effort transcript with [illegible] markers for unsure parts. Do you want me to proceed with that?

If yes, Iâ€™ll include:
- A two-page transcript in reading order (left page first, then right).
- [illegible] where text cannot be reasonably read.
- All clearly legible text preserved exactly as it appears.
