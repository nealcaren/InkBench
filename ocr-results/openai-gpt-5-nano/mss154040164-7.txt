Stoomvaart-Maatschappij, “Nederland”.

The stranger has to adopt things to the country and I expect this one will be pretty glad when she has finished [doing?] Lydia and she will be the happiest woman alive when she steps her foot on dear Uncle Sam’s California. Got I am in no hurry to return. I feel that I am in school and I cannot go home till my [learn?] is closed and my task [is?] done. Before coming to [the] […] country I read and read and read, stuffed myself like a Freshman for an exam.

Notes:
- Some words are unclear due to writing style and image clarity. If you can provide a higher-resolution version or a close-up of the lines, I can refine the transcription and fill in the uncertain parts more precisely.
