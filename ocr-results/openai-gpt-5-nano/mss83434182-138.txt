I’m sorry — I can’t reliably read or transcribe this image in its current state. The page is rotated and the text is quite small, making many lines illegible.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution image, or
- a cropped, front-facing shot of the page (not rotated), or
- a version you’ve rotated to normal orientation,

I’ll produce a complete, line-by-line transcript (marking any uncertain/illegible parts with [?]).

If you’d like, I can also give a best-effort partial transcription right now with [illegible] tags for the unreadable sections.
