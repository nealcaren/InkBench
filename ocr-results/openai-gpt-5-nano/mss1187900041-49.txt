Washington D.C.
April 15th 1869

Dear Father,

Your reply to my letter was received yesterday.

From what you said in your letter to Lewis I learned that you supposed I was discharged for neglect of duty, or some other such cause; but such was not the case.

Genl. Howard did not know at first that I was among the number, and he instructed me afterwards that had I been a member of the Law Department would have been released. The following is the truth:

Mr. Langston has taken charge of the Law Department of the Indian University, and has about twenty colored students.
