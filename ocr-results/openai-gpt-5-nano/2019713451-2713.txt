This is now the only Report of Fashions published in the United States that we know of, if we except a few lithographic prints, which are scarce copies of last year's European Reports, most villainously colored, and mere caricatures of the French, English, and German plates, from which they were copied. This is the only original American Report of Fashions; therefore, let those in favor of American Union and Independence buy no copy of foreign fashions, under any pretence, for they are either foreign or bogus.
