I can provide a transcription, but several words are difficult to read. Iâ€™ve done my best to preserve the legible text and marked uncertain parts with [illegible].

Brooklyn March 7th, 18[66?]
My Dear Mr. Douglass

I send you a clipping from the Brooklyn Eagle of the 6th inst., and [illegible] not beyond your [illegible] and would not have been consulted [illegible] in the chambers of a Republican paper, is especially [illegible] [Remember/remembered] when it comes from a [Red Hot] Democrat.

All things considered I think you have every reason to congratulate yourself on 206

Note: Several words near the middle and bottom of the page are not clearly legible in this image; I can re-check if you provide a higher-resolution scan or a closer crop of the center portion.
