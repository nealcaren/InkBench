Hon Fred Douglass  
Dear Sir  

Francis M Adelington of Weymouth Mass. 86 Years of age desires the following offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration “Father Abraham’s Monument.”  

This Monument would seem to say That Lincoln’s dead, but tis not so.  
In vain the aspassed aim to slay;  
In vain the blood War made to flow.  
In vain the vile attempt to kill  
In all our hearts he’s living still.  
And while a drop of patriot blood  
Shall flow in any human frame,  
Will think at memory of the good  
The great and noble Lincoln Name.  
This Monument we raise to thee  
Great Chief whose Mandate Made us free  
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascended  
For Thee, Our true and constant friend.  

Also the following  
“A [drip] to America Personified”  
The World is gazing on thee.  
Dispose thy robes with care  
And with thy precious jewels  
A crown thy Golden hair  
“Over”
