I can transcribe it, but this image is quite difficult to read in several places. A higher-resolution image or a clearer scan would help ensure a complete and accurate transcript. If youâ€™d like, I can provide a best-effort transcription with uncertainty markers (e.g., [illegible]) for the unclear portions. Would you like me to proceed this way?
