My dear Dr. Catt:

I am enclosing herewith an editorial written by Mr. F. S. Burrage, owner and editor of the Laramie Republican Boomerang. Mr. Burrage opened his paper for the cause of suffrage during the last hectic days and gave unlimited space in his paper for the cause of suffrage. He has quite frequently in the paper expressed his admiration for you in the way in which you have possessed yourself in the great hours of marvelous victory.

Lovingly yours,

However, like thyself, I am most immediately conscious that a proper attendant must be secured before long. Coz.

Mary writes me that Lizzie Lee is not to be had, & has not health enough for the place if she were. I shall

Lovingly,

Note: The bottom newspaper clippings pasted on the pages contain additional text, but the handwriting and print are partially illegible in the image, so those portions could not be transcribed with confidence. If you’d like, I can attempt a more focused pass on those clipped sections to try to extract any readable lines.
