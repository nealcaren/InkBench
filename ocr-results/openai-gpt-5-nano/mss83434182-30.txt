I’m having trouble reading this image clearly. The page is rotated and the text is small/low-contrast, so I can’t produce a reliable complete transcript right now.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution image, and/or
- orient the page so the text is upright,

I will deliver a full line-by-line transcription, preserving exactly what’s on the page and marking any illegible sections with [?]. If you’d like, I can also give a best-effort partial transcription from the current image with all clearly readable parts.
