I’m ready to transcribe, but this image is too faint and the cursive is very difficult to read reliably. I don’t want to guess and provide an inaccurate transcript.

Would you like me to:
- attempt a best‑effort transcription with [illegible] markers for unreadable sections, or
- receive a higher‑resolution / clearer image (or the original page) so I can produce a precise, complete transcription?
