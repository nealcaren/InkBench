I can provide the full transcript, but this image is quite faint in places and several words are not legible. Would you like me to proceed with a best‑effort transcription and mark uncertain words as [illegible] (or [?]), or would you prefer I wait for a clearer/high‑resolution image to ensure a precise transcription?
