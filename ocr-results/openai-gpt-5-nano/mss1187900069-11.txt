I’m happy to transcribe, but the handwriting in this image is quite difficult to read clearly. I don’t want to guess and provide an inaccurate transcript.

Could you provide a higher-resolution version of this page, or crop/adjust contrast so the text is more legible? If you’d like, I can also produce a best-effort transcript now and mark uncertain words with [unclear] or [illegible] so you can verify them later.
