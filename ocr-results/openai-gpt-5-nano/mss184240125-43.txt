I came to Boston in Novr to make a short visit before winter, & I am still here, now waiting for winter to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only been to the Opera a few times. I have seen more of the celebrities, they were too costly. My heart is not broken, nor but here easily. I thought I should see you there this spring, because the papers said so. It has been a trying winter, but spring & violets are near the window. Aggie writes me oft’n, & is happy if her bit of house-work will do itself. But if she is shut in, she so hates in- door duties. That she frets, the harness chafes. She has a good-practical man, who keeps her from crying unhears of things. Saint’s easy. God bless you dear – always. Lovingly, Mama Lee.
