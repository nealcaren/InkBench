146 WHO AM DE MUDDER.

BONES.—Perhaps she thought she could hatchet.
JOHNSON.—I suppose you understand poultry?
BONES.—Yes!
JOHNSON.—Then perhaps you can answer this question. We'll suppose a hen lays a dozen eggs, along comes another hen and hatches these eggs, now who is the mother of the chickens, the hen that lays the eggs or the hen that hatches them.
BONES.—Are you talking to me?
JOHNSON.—Of course I am.
BONES.—What sort of eggs were these?
JOHNSON.—It doesn't matter; supposing a hen lays a dozen eggs, and another hen hatches them, who is the mother?
BONES.—Why don't you ask somebody else, dat's too simple for me.
JOHNSON.—I'm afraid you do not know it.
BONES.—Yes, I do!
JOHNSON.—Then who is the mother?
BONES.—What sort of hen was she, just a common ebery-day hen, I suppose.
JOHNSON.—It doesn't matter, supposing a hen lays a dozen eggs and another hen hatches them, who is the mother?
BONES.—You want to know, who's de mother?
JOHNSON.—Yes, of course I do!
BONES.—Why, de—de—de—who's the father?
JOHNSON.—That's nothing to do with it.
BONES.—Yes it is, I must know who de father is.
JOHNSON.—Ah! I can see you don't know it.
BONES.—Yes I do; you say, one egg lays a dozen chickens along comes another egg and sits on de chickens, and hatches a dozen hens.
JOHNSON.—No, I did not say that!
BONES.—Oh! you're all mixed up.
JOHNSON.—I'm afraid it's you that are mixed up. I said, "Suppose a hen lays a dozen eggs, and another hen hatches them, who is the mother?"
BONES.—Why, de hen that lays de eggs!
JOHNSON.—Oh! no; the hen that hatches them is the mother.
BONES.—No, sir; I can see dat your education on poultry has been sadly neglected.

AN AWFUL RESPONSIBILITY.

BONES.—Say, Mr. Jonsing, you don't come to see us now like you used to one time; mother's been enquiring about you lately.
JOHNSON.—How is the old lady?
BONES.—Oh! she's first class.
JOHNSON.—No, I’ve not been down to see her for quite three months now. I remember the last time I paid her a visit I'd been travelling in the interior for some time, and when I got to your house it was just dinner time, and your mother asked me to take a seat at the table, which I accepted; and I ate a very hearty meal; having just arrived from off a long journey my appetite was very keen.
