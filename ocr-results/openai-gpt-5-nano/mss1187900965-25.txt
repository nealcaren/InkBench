LAW OFFICE OF
ROBERT G. INGERSOLL,
1421 NEW YORK AVENUE.

WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov 6, 1883

Dear Young Lady,

I think the quotation at the head of your articles a little bit off color. There is an appeal to mercy rather than to justice — I think the following from the same play is better.

“ You take my house when you do take the means whereby I live.”

That both maintain my house. You take my life,
When you do take the means whereby I live.

You will pardon the question. What keeps you [illegible] day?
