toward the close of the war. The few days we lay in camp there witnessed the stirring and eventful scenes around Peters­burg which culminated in Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, and saw General Joseph E. Johnson’s army retreating through North Carolina, followed by Sherman. About the time we went into camp at Faison the battle of Bentonville was fought, probably not more than twenty-five miles from us. 

While we lay in camp at Faison Station an incident occurred which in its result was quite important to me; and it was so unique in its character that I deem it worth relating briefly. Had the result been different I might not care to tell the story. 

Although no enemy was near we kept a good picket line, for we did not know when the night would appear. The Confederates had a habit of coming at unexpected times, and experience had taught us the necessity of constant vigilance. We were short of lieutenants, and I found myself detailed one morning to take a lieutenant’s place on the picket line. At the same time that the Adjutant detailed me thus, he notified Captain Riley of Company K that he had been detailed as brigade officer of the day. I don’t question now but what all was right and straight in the transaction, but I felt at the time that I was being imposed upon. Officers in the army lay much stress on rank, and when I saw myself detailed to do a lieutenant’s duty on the picket line, and the captain of another company going out as brigade officer of the day, I thought I was not receiving fair treatment, and so informed the adjutant, using pretty strong language. But my hot words didn’t change matters any, and we went out just as we were detailed. 

I was in charge of the men from our regiment, and fortune so arranged matters that we were placed directly opposite the headquarters of General Terry, then commanding our corps, and not more than thirty or forty rods from his tent. Soon after we went on duty Captain Riley, brigade officer of the day, came along the line, and in addition to giving me some general directions, instructed me specially that it was the order of General Paine, commanding our division, that no person be allowed to pass any portion of the picket line held by his men except on a pass given or countersigned by him. The order seemed unusual to me, and I asked him if he was sure he was not mistaken, and the order as he gave it to me was exactly as he had received it from the division office of the day, Major Brazee. I had full confidence in Captain Riley’s word, and resolved to execute the order strictly, although I was sure somebody was making a mistake. 

Very soon a detail in charge of a sergeant came from the corps hospital, desiring to pass through the picket line out into the woods to
