Here is my best effort transcription of the page. I’ve marked unclear or unreadable sections with [?].

1601 Mt. Vernon Street,
Philadelphia.                                         Oct 23rd 92

[Sta for Duspass]
My Dear Sir,

I am left here yesterday on my way I heard your speech; I thought I heard you must pleasure declare it. I had more mis[read] with it as I thought; last night I read it to my father; he has much pleasure & united with me in [???] it [though] I should declare it though [the country] will do just good.

Yours truly, [signature illegible]

Notes:
- The top lines (address/date) are clear, but the line directly under the address before “My Dear Sir” is difficult to read and appears as “Sta for Duspass” (unclear).
- Many small words in the body are faint or slanted; several terms are uncertain and shown as [?] where readability is too low to be confident.
- The closing signature is illegible in this image.
