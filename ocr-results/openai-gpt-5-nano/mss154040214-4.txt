Miss Rose Manus,
Jacob Obrechtsstraat 67,
Amsterdam-Zuid,
Holland.

My dear Rose:

I have done a great deal of thinking about marriage.

Mrs. Ashby said that if I ever intended to cross the ocean again, this was the time to do it. As a matter of fact I had about made up my mind never to cross that ocean again, yet, after reading her letter, I thought hard upon that subject. I finally concluded that there really was no particular help that I could give.

I am not so familiar with the Alliance now. I do not know the women who are the workers. My generation, like Annie [????], are saying good-bye to you, who are younger, are putting our tasks on younger shoulders.

The great question is what to do with the Alliance. If I could go over with a pocket full of money for you all, I think you would be glad to see me, but alas, everybody is poor here at present. Everybody has lost money and income, but the taxes have gone enormous high and yet they do not bring in much, because people have so little that can be saved. The depression did not reach us until after it had made much trouble for Europe. Now we are getting it full blast. It is amazing that all the plans made for the general situation have had so little effect upon it. It simply grows worse and worse.

At present, I can see no prospect in any direction of receiving money here for the Alliance. The organizations are all struggling hard to get money for their own budgets which have been cut down.

Looking back over the history of the Alliance, it would seem that Great Britain and the United States have furnished the major quantity of money the Alliance has cost. Now these two sources are more or less cut off, and no other country known to me is likely to come forward and take their places.

I have written to Mrs. Ashby and I enclose a copy of the letter which repeats much that I have said to you. Those ideas may not be good ones. If that is so, it is because I do not know the situation well.

You must not think of me as a person who can run

any more, so if I should go to Marseilles, Alda Wilson must go with me and I would have to hurry back.

This year I went to Washington, as usual, but I came down with a cold and was in bed most of the time that we were there. I then came home and went to bed again. I stayed there a week and occupied my room a good deal longer time. My cold has now gone away and I am feeling fairly well, with the exception of my feet and legs, but, dear Rose, I can no longer make speeches.

I hope you will soon be all right again. We shall be meeting again some of these days.

Lovingly,

CCC: HW.
