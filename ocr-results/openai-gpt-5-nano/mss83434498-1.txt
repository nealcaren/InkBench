I’m unable to reliably read the text in this image to provide a complete transcription. The clipping is too small/low-contrast for accurate line-by-line transcription.

If you can share a higher-resolution image (or crop the clipping to a larger size), I’ll provide a full, exact transcript with illegible portions marked as [illegible] (or [????]) as per the transcription guidelines.
