I can transcribe what’s legible, and mark the uncertain parts. Some words in this image are faint or cut off, so I note them with [illegible] or [unclear].

Transcript

Norwhich (Newmarket?), July 18, 1891.
My dear friends:—

Charlotte and I congratulate you upon your safe arrival back to Washington. Charlotte is [unclear] in [Norwich/Newmarket] for a few weeks. Mrs. [Moore/Moores?] remains at New Haven. Mrs. [C?] comes frequently to pass the day with me and I return the visit. She suggested my writing to you. Writing has become [quite burdensome] to [her?] [and] to her [it is] becoming [burdensome?]. But that she has improved since her arrival on the island is clearly evident. She did not think of walking out at all when I was in New Haven— now she does more walking than [illegible].

Notes
- The city name at the top is hard to read; I’ve noted it as “Norwhich (Newmarket?)” in case it’s one of those.
- Several names and short phrases are not clearly legible in the image (likely names like Moore/Moore/Moore[s], C[harlotte] etc.). I’ve indicated those as [illegible] or [unclear].
- The last line finishes mid-sentence in the image, so I couldn’t supply a full closing.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped close-up of the header and the two lower lines, I can refine the transcription and fill in the missing names and wording more precisely.
