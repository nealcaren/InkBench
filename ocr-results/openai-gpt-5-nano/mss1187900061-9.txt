Instead of making Murlea and Bisket I would try send you a line. I hope you will because bad writing and spelling as you will find. I have seen Miss Reed twice since you left, every thing is going on just the same so I have no news to tell you all are well at home hoping that you are. Rosa is well and sends love to you.

Truly your friend
Louisa Sprague
