Here is a best-effort transcription of the legible text from the item. Some portions of the page are difficult to read; I have marked uncertain or illegible parts with [illegible].

Elements.
Principles of Small Letters.
Scale of Lengths.
Principles of the Capitals.

Give Special Heed to these Directions.
This No. is the sequel to No. 1, the preparation for No. 3. The directions here given take for granted that those on the cover of No. 1 have been studied and followed. In this No. the letters formed from the first four principles are reviewed, and the stem-letters, t, d, p, g, are introduced.

The Contractions used are as follows: — m., l., Main Line; c, L, Connecting Line; s, n, etc. (illegible portion)

The Diagram on the cover shows the Elements, Principles, and Scale of Lengths. The Diagram above the copy, the part made at each Count, the Principles, and the way the copy is to be placed in the lines.

SUGGESTIONS. The only possible way of teaching penmanship successfully in a school is to have all the scholars write the same line in the same book at the same time. The order of instruction is Knowledge, Execution, Criticism. First, Knowledge. Explain the copy carefully, and have it analyzed into its Principles and then into its Elements. Teach the nature, peculiarity, slope, beginning and ending of each element; notice the connections between the Principles, and the combining lines between the letters; call attention to similarity and parallelism of parts and lines.

Second, Execution. Let them first trace the copy with dry pens. Then have one line in the column written, directing the pupils to be very careful as to the copy to be placed in the lines.

Third, Criticism. Criticize the line written, by asking questions on each particular given as knowledge, which the class answers by raising their hands. The errors lie, of course, on each side of the truth. Thus, if the line is a curve, it may be curved the wrong way, or too much or too little; if slope, then too much or too little; the turn will be correct, or too broad, or too narrow. Select one or two of the most prevalent faults, discovered by the answers and by your own observation, for correction, direct special attention to them, and have more line written than you may be able to correct.

Then criticize these same points, see how many have succeeded in correcting them, and write one more line. Thus, this exercise will be continued until the whole is perfected.

GENERAL RULES. 1. Begin and end in the corners. 2. Every principle touches both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the sides of the oval written downward; the ovals, the second upstroke of and v, and the second and fourth of w. See Manual, Chap. III. The Connecting Lines are the rest of the curves written upwards. The Turns unite main to connecting lines. Sometimes the main and connecting lines unite in a point; this is termed a Connection. The line formed between two letters by their connecting lines running into one another at the middle of the space is termed a Combining Line. 4. The odd numbers are used for the upstrokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are five Elements, numbered in the order in which they occur in the Principles. There are six Principles in the small letters; from these, with the addition of a few exceptional parts, all the small letters are made. 6. The red lines mark the columns, each of which is divided into three oblongs or boxes. Write down the columns always. 7. The m. s. is 50° from base-line.

N.B. Teachers will find our Manual of Pennmanship a complete compendium of the art of teaching writing. The Blackboard Tablets are invaluable for presenting the Elements, Principles, and Capitals, of large size and perfect form. The Oblique Lines are a great help to the scholars in acquiring correct slope.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE COPIES.
COPY 1. KNOWLEDGE. The 1’s and 2’s are [illegible] respectively. The top of 1 is a little more than half across the box. The middle slope of 2, and the distance between them. Observe Rules 1, 2, 3, 4. Analyze P.1 from Diagram on cover. P.1 has been fully explained. Notice that the second [illegible] is perfectly straight through [illegible] the first line. The second 2 is 50° from the base line. The remaining directions are [illegible].
