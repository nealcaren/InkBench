commitment signers. Only when several of these parents had expressed their desire for help in meeting the spiritual needs of their children was the first step toward establishment of a Sunday School taken.

On December 13, 1946, four mothers met with Dr. Thurman and Mrs. Bachels, the study group chairman, to determine the general direction in which to go, and the first steps to be taken. All agreed that they wanted their children to have opportunity to discover a sound spiritual basis for everyday living; that whatever they were taught should be so basic that nothing needed be unwarranted later, but that all would contribute to building desirable foundations for lifelong growth. The few books Dr. Thurman had amassed were distributed to the mothers for study, comment and exchange.

Dr. Frank had suggested Miss Ruth Adams, a student at San Francisco State College, as a possibility for the teacher we needed. Miss Adams was invited to visit the church to get the “feel” of the Fellowship Church ideal. After her visit and an interview with Dr. Thurman she met with the mothers to complete preliminary plans.

In the meantime the mothers had inspected the available rooms, and decided that the children should meet in the soundproof radio room at the rear of the downstairs auditorium during the Church hour.

From six children on January 13, the attendance rose to twenty on April 20, 1947. Miss Lilian Raymond, a nursery school teacher, began helping and now the group is divided, with Miss Raymond in charge of the younger children. Kindergarten chairs have been provided through the courtesy of two friends of the Church.

In response to the request of the mothers for guidance in carrying their part of the responsibility, the “right person at the right time” has again appeared. Miss Alice Ellis of the Child Guidance Department of the San Francisco Schools asked for information about Fellowship Church just to be invited to meet with Miss Adams and the parents on Monday, May 5.

Since this meeting Miss Ellis has set aside an hour every other week for individual appointments with the mothers; there has been further discussion and activity and questions stimulated by their Sunday experiences, etc.

The need for music has found a distinctive solution. A zither is used by Sue Thurman, accompanist, to furnish music for the group, and several young members of the Church will be trained by her to carry on this musical program.

FELLOWSHIP CHURCH MUSIC (second column, heading on the left page)

A National Associate member of Fellowship Church remarked recently that it was worth a trip across the country to join in the hymns of this particular congregation and to hear the singing of the Fellowship Choir. Beginning in the spring of 1946 as a sextet with an occasional soloist, the present choral unit has grown to a choir of [text unclear]. The choir is an important part of the church’s life and has provided musical leadership for the congregation during the past years. It is composed of lay members and students, with a number of the singers training for professional careers in music; the group is under the direction of [text unclear]. They give regular Sunday services and special programs, and have participated in a number of community events in the city.

[Several lines are illegible here; the gist concerns the size, formation, and activities of the Fellowship Church choir and its role in the church and community.]

The choir’s repertoire includes Continental and American sacred works, and the group has enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with visiting choirs and soloists. The choir’s growth has paralleled the growth of the church’s youth music program, and its members have benefited from the leadership of the church’s music director, who also teaches at the local college.

The article closes with notes on the choir's contributions to the life of the church and to the broader community, including its role in worship and in cultural exchange.
