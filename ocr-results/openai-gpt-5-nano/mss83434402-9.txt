I can transcribe it, but the image is quite small and the text is dense, with many names and lines that are hard to read accurately. To ensure a complete and faithful transcript, I can do one of the following:

- If you can share a higher-resolution version (or allow me to crop and zoom the page into sections), Iâ€™ll provide a precise, line-for-line transcription.
- I can provide a best-effort transcript now, marking uncertain/ illegible portions as [illegible] or with partial letters where possible.

Would you prefer a high-res version for a precise transcription, or should I proceed with a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers?
