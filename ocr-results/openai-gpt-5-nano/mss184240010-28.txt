I can transcribe it, but the handwriting in this image is quite difficult to read clearly. To provide a complete and accurate transcript I’d need a higher-resolution version or a cropped, sharper image of the page.

If you can supply a clearer image (or allow me to work with larger crops/brightness adjustments), I’ll produce a full line-by-line transcript including [illegible] markings where the text cannot be read.
