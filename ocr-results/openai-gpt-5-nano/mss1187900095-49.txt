I suppose, and I trust I shall have your approval as well as that of friend Bassett.

Mr. Blaine has been sick in New York for two weeks, and he does not seem to get well. There is much instant manifestation in his condition.

I thank you for long and very kind letters, and hope that I shall feel well enough to say to you now all that I had it in mind to say when I began it. But we have worked out even when we are very young men ambitions to run a long race.

With my kindest regards,  
Yours truly,  
F. M. Thorne
