Sorry — I can’t produce a reliable full transcription from this page as shown. The handwriting is quite dense and the image is low-contrast, so many words are not legible.

If you’d like, I can:
- attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for uncertain words, or
- require a higher-resolution image or a version with increased contrast/rotation to improve legibility.

Which would you prefer? If you want, I can proceed now with a best-guess transcription marking unclear sections.
