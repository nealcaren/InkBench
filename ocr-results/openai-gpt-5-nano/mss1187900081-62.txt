Here is my best effort transcription of the letter. Some portions of the handwriting are difficult to read, so I’ve marked uncertain words with [illegible] or [unclear]. If you can provide a higher‑resolution image, I can refine those.

Ellis House, O. B. Stanton, Prop.
STANTON HOUSE, Abilene, H. H. Stanton & Son, Prop’s.
UNION PACIFIC HOTEL, Topeka, H. H. Stanton.

Ellis, Kansas, Oct 26, 1888

A. Morehouse Esq.
Dear Sir:

The enclosed
[illegible] from the [Kansas City Times] of the 25th I enclose to you for your verification or denial as to [your] [illegible] antagonists, and [friends] in this state, have read the enclosed with much [suspense] and sorrow. We have been induced to believe that both New York, and Indiana could be fully [illegible] up to cast their electoral vote for our [Galvest?] Standard Bearers, Harrison and Morton. I reply, either confirming or denying the enclosed, will greatly oblige.

[illegible] or [illegible]
[Signature]
[illegible] [illegible] Evening

Notes:
- Several words in the body are not clearly legible in the image, including some after “The enclosed” and the closing lines. If you can share a higher-res version or a zoomed crop of the body, I’ll fill these in precisely.
- The header appears clearly as the Ellis House stationery with the listed properties and the date. The recipient looks like “A. Morehouse Esq.”, but please confirm if you have a different spelling.
