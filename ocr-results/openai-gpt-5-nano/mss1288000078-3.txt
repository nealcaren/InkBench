I’m happy to help, but this image is too faint to read reliably. I can’t provide an accurate complete transcription as-is.

Options:
- If you can upload a higher-resolution version (or a cropped, higher-contrast scan), I’ll transcribe it exactly.
- Alternatively, I can give you a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for unclear words based on this image. Let me know which you prefer.
