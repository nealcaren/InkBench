I’m sorry — I can’t reliably read the full text from this image. The handwriting is quite difficult to decipher at this resolution, and a complete, accurate transcript would require a clearer image (higher resolution, better contrast, or a rotated/scanned version).

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution version, or
- a rotated image that makes the lines easier to follow,

I’ll provide a full, line-by-line transcription (marking any illegible words as [?] where needed).
