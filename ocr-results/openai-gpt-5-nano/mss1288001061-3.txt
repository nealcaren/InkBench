I can transcribe it, but the handwriting on this image is very faint and several words are not clearly legible. If you’d like, I can provide a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for uncertain parts, or you can supply a higher-resolution image and I’ll produce a precise verbatim transcript.

Would you like me to proceed with a best-effort transcription using [illegible] markers for unclear sections?
