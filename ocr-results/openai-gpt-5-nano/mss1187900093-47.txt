Here is my best-possible transcription of the visible text. Some sections are faint and illegible, so I’ve marked unreadable parts with [illegible] where appropriate.

Right column (top to bottom):
- we already yours - Both of you —
- I was glad to see a notice
- of your lecture and wished that
- I was there to enjoy it. I’m
- sure that you can make your
- experience very interesting and
- valuable. And then Mr.
- Douglass has I doubt not his
- hands full of literary work
- about which you can assist
- him if you have not all that
- you can do yourself —
- I shall write to Miss [illegible]
- is day, and tell her all that
- I know of your movements —
- because of so much I am certain
- that you cannot leisure in
- Washington and be also on the road
- to Porto — and Prince —
- I want the Douglans to avoid
- great mental strain and so indulge his waning years that he
- may stay as long as possible with us.

Left column (the visible portion is very faint; the rest could not be read clearly):
- a lecture in Washington —
- then I said “I will write” and
- this is my letter of inquiry —
- Have you given up your
- journey to Hartford? If so I
- cannot help being glad at the
- chance to be of use to you —
- and to entertain you if I can
- in any way that will be of
- benefit to you. [illegible]

If you can share a higher-resolution version or a scan with better contrast, I can tighten up the transcription and fill in more of the illegible segments.
