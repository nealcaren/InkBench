I can provide a transcription of the left-hand column, but parts of the text are quite small and faint. Below is my best effort with unclear words marked as [illegible].

LIBERIA, a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1820 by the American Colonization Society (see Colonization Soc.), and established as an independent state in 1847, is between 4° 20′ and 7° 20′ N. lat., and stretches along the Atlantic from the Sherboro River on the W. to the Pedro River on the S. E., a distance of about 600 miles. Its area, which is steadily increased by purchases from the native tribes, was estimated in 1890 at 14,000 square miles. The shore is elevated and rocky in the S.

Many streams flow to the ocean, but none of them navigable for more than 20 miles from the mouth; the most important are the St. Paul, [illegible], and the Cape Mount River. The climate is thoroughly tropical. Of the two seasons the dry lasts from October to June, and the wet from June to October. In the dry season the average heat is about 84°F, the thermometer seldom rising above 90°F. The natives, who are of various tribes, are described as [illegible], though they have made some progress in education and civilization under missionary effort. Coffee, palm oil, cotton, and gum are among the principal exports. The population is [illegible], the government is a republic, and the capital is Monrovia.

If you’d like, I can try to refine this further with a higher-resolution image or more of the page visible, and I’ll mark every uncertain word more precisely.
