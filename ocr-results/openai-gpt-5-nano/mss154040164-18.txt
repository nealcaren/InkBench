My dear Sidney:

I cannot think I could possibly convey to you the very great pleasure and satisfaction your breezy letter gave me. I wanted to know all that you told me, and you told it clearly that it was like a conversation with you.

The Christmas card came and was hung up on the door and was there for a day or two. They tell us that travellers in the tropics must beware of diarrhoea, but I thought myself quite immune as I had not had such a thing for thirty years, but I got one somewhere and was in bed a week. All our troops had a turn at it, but we fortunately did not. I did also get your good by cable in Southampton and certainly did acknowledge it by return.
