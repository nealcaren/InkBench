I’m sorry — this image isn’t legible enough for a reliable full transcription. The handwriting is very faint and several sections are hard to read, so I risk providing an inaccurate transcript.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image (or zoomed-in crops of the two pages), I’ll transcribe it verbatim and preserve line breaks and punctuation exactly.
