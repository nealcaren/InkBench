Here is my best effort at a complete transcription of the page, with uncertain or illegible parts marked clearly.

Georgeville, P. L., U.S. 8?

Papa & Mamma:

Yesterday we went on a pleasant picnic to Fitle Bay. It was an all-day trip. We had an early breakfast, & then the Holbrooks came over & we all piled into a little steam-launch, chartered for the occasion. It carries 25, & there were 25 of us. The engine divides it in the middle, with wood heaped up on each side (ferry a steam-engine run by wood) & the back of the boat something something.

[Note: The remaining lines on the page are cut off or obscured, so the rest of the sentence is illegible here.]
