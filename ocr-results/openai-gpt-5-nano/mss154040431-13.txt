I can transcribe the clearly legible parts, but the rest of the clipping is too small/blurred to read reliably from this image. Here is what I can read exactly:

- ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%

- "Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race," Berlin Councillor Declares.

The remainder of the text on the clipping is too faint to decipher accurately. If you can provide a higher-resolution version or a cropped zoom of the clipping, I can complete the transcription line by line.
