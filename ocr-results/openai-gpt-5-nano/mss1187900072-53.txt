I can provide a transcript, but the image is quite faint in places and several words are hard to read. I can give you a best-effort transcription with unclear words marked as [illegible]. If you’d like, I can also try again from a higher-resolution image or a different orientation.

Best-effort transcript (with [illegible] where unreadable):

may wish you hoping not to be wearisome.
Charlotte writes that she received an invitation from Mrs. Dane [Marie Nicholls?] to attend an Alumnae gathering in Washington, before which Stephen [Fletcher?] [daughter] Alice had been invited to read a paper. Charlotte listened to her address with absorbing interest for her parents as well as for her ward, and said it was a very enthusiastic description of the gown-ment of all the collected that are worthy of the name. Miss Porter is a teacher in the Girls High School in Boston. Where may Cousins, Editor of the One who died, father of above — also teachers.

Notes:
- The passage contains several uncertain names and terms that are not clearly legible in the image (e.g., “Mrs. Dane,” “Marie Nicholls,” “Stephen [something],” etc.). I’ve indicated possible reads where they appear.
- If you can provide a higher-res version or confirm some of the names from context, I can refine the transcription further.
