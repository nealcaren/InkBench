I can transcribe it, but the image is too small to read all the text clearly. To ensure a complete and accurate transcript, please provide a higher-resolution version or a cropped scan of the page.

If you’d like, I can attempt a best-effort transcription now and mark the uncertain parts with [illegible] or [?], but I don’t want to guess text that isn’t readable. Would you prefer:

- A best-effort transcript with [illegible] where I can’t read clearly, or
- A request for a higher-res image to deliver a precise, line-for-line transcript?
