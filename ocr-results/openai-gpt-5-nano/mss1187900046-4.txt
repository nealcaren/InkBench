My Dear father.
I have received your kind letter and was very glad to hear from you, but I am so sorry that you feel so. A heart going to Rochester; I hope it will be all right there, when you go there. I shall take good care of your letters and not think of distroying them in any way; we have had a few very pleasant weather.
