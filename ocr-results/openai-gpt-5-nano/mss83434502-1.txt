I’m glad to help, but the handwriting in this image is too faint to read reliably. Here is what I can make out with confidence, and I’ve marked the unclear portions:

- Jan 1865
- Huntsville Ala…
- Co K 73rd Indiana Vol.
- A delicious dinner spread
- [illegible text about it being furnished by …]
- [illegible text about color]

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a clearer scan, I can transcribe the remaining lines more accurately and produce a complete transcript.
