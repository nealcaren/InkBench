Sorry — I can’t provide a reliable complete transcription from this image. The handwriting is very faint and many words are unclear, so a faithful transcription would require a higher-resolution image or a clearer scan.

What I can make out with confidence:
- The line that reads: "The sex that is qualified for the scaffold is qualified for the vote" (quote appears clearly, though the surrounding text is faded)
- A fragment suggesting a date: "began in 1905, was later driven underground" (partially legible)

If you can provide a higher‑resolution image or another page in better focus, I’ll produce a full, line‑by‑line transcription with [illegible] markers where appropriate.
