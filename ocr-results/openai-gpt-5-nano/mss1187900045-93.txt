Transcription notes:
- The handwriting is highly cursive and several words are not clearly legible even in the image. I have preserved the letters that are readable and marked unclear words with [illegible]. I transcribed in the reading order that the page presents (right-hand page first, then the left-hand page as it appears). Where the text continues on the facing page, I include both sides in sequence.

Right-hand page (top-right to bottom-right)
we [illegible] the life [illegible] of [illegible] at once. The first letter I had from him here gave me coherent & sufficient proof that nurse was proving incompetent, - though I can’t reconcile it with her apparent efficiency at 1601. However, like thyself, I am most immediately conscious that a proper attendant must be secured before long. Coz. May writes me that Lizzie Lee is not to be had, & has not health enough for the place if she were. I shall

Left-hand page (as it appears on the opposite page)
[illegible text begins here; the handwriting is very crowded and many words are not readable]
[several lines of text are indeterminable due to heavy cursive and overlapping ink]
[there are phrases that appear to reference responsibility, concern for health, and arrangements, but the exact wording is not legible]
[the page ends with additional lines that cannot be confidently read from the image provided]

If you’d like, I can try another pass with a higher-resolution crop or you can share a sharper image of this page. I can also annotate specific sections you’re most interested in (e.g., the passages about the nurse, the health of Lizzie Lee, or the mention of “1601”) and attempt to improve legibility on those parts.
