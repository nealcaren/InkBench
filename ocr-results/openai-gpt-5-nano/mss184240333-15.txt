I’m sorry — I can’t produce a reliable full transcription from this image. The handwriting is highly cursive and many words are unclear or damaged, making it difficult to read accurately. If you can provide a higher‑resolution image, a clearer scan, or a version with better contrast (or rotated upright), I can transcribe it line by line and mark uncertain words as [?].
