Sorry — I can’t confidently read all of the small print on this image to provide a complete, accurate transcript. If you can supply a higher-resolution version (or a cropped version of the two pages with better clarity), I can transcribe it verbatim.

If you’d like, I can also attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for unclear sections using the current image, but it may be incomplete or inaccurate in places. Would you like me to do that?
