Dear Miss Blackwell,

We will be very glad indeed to have you on the committee even though you can take no active part. Enough Jimmie Higgins turned up to do the work, & no reasonable person could expect you to do the detailed work of the committee.

We will probably have a banquet as soon as we can get a place together, as that seems to be the time honored method of raising money.

The National Committee informs me that a broadcasting station with license can be bought for $50,000. But they want to raise more, a total of $260,000; hardly to get a more powerful station, & partly to have an endowment to cover operating expenses in case the commercial users should attempt to boycott us.

Fraternally,
Alfred Baker Lewis
