I’m happy to transcribe it, but the current image is too low-resolution and the handwriting is very difficult to read. I don’t want to guess and produce an inaccurate transcript.

If you can provide:
- A higher-resolution scan (300–600 dpi) or
- Clear crops of each column/page,

I can produce a full, faithful transcription (with illegible parts clearly marked, e.g., [?], [illegible], or [unclear] as appropriate).

If you’d like, I can also attempt a best-effort partial transcription with the clearly legible sections and mark the uncertain parts.
