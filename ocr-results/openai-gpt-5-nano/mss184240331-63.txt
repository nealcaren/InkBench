Sorry — I can’t produce a reliable, complete transcript from this image as it stands. The handwriting is quite faint and many words are illegible, making a faithful transcription risky.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution image, or
- a crop of just the handwritten portion, oriented upright,

I’ll transcribe it verbatim. Alternatively, I can give you a best-effort version with [illegible] markers for uncertain words if you’d like.
