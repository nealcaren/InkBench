I can transcribe it, but the handwriting in this image is quite faint and many words are difficult to read. I can provide a best‑effort transcription with uncertain words marked as [illegible]. If you can share a higher‑resolution image (or confirm the date/recipient), I can improve accuracy.

Would you like me to proceed with a best‑effort transcription using [illegible] where I can’t read clearly?
