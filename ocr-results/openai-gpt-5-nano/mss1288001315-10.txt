SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING
THE RETURN OF
WOMEN AS POOR LAW GUARDIANS.

Reasons for having Ladies as Poor Law Guardians.

Because the larger number of Paupers are women and children.

Because the great evil of Pauperism can only be diminished
by more care in the bringing up of children.

Because the girls brought up in Pauper Schools require the
superintendence of ladies to ensure their better training for
domestic work.

Because experience has shown their utility in the Unions where
ladies have been elected as Poor Law Guardians.

Because so many women are Ratepayers that they should be
represented by women as well as by men.

Because ladies are accustomed to visit among the Poor, and
are well acquainted with their requirements.

Because ladies have leisure and can give careful attention to
matters brought before the Boards of Guardians.

Because many of the women who are brought before Guardians
ought to be dealt with only by their own sex.

Because ladies being accustomed to household management
are certain to exercise rigid economy in details.

For these reasons the support of the ratepayers to
secure the election of a fair proportion of women as
Poor Law Guardians is earnestly requested.

*An Annual Subscription of 2/6 constitutes membership of the Society.

For general information apply to the Hon. Sec.,
Miss L. M. Cooper, 20, Cromwell Place, South Kensington.
