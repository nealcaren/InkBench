I can transcribe it, but the page is quite small and the text is densely printed, making many entries difficult to read reliably from this image. If you’d like, I can do a best-effort transcription with uncertain parts marked as [illegible], or you can provide a higher-resolution image (or a scan of the page). Which would you prefer?

If you want a best-effort start now, I can provide what is legible (headers and the main column titles) and mark the unclear rows, e.g.,

- 68 UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN
- BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA—Continued.
- [Table headers—approximate read, vertical orientation]: Name, No., Rank, Co., Regiment, Date of death, Grave, Remarks.

Then I’d list the first few entries that are readable and note [illegible] for the rest. Would you like me to proceed that way?
