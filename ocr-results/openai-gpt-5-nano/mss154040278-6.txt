I’m happy to transcribe, but this image is quite difficult to read clearly. I don’t want to guess and provide something incorrect.

Would you like me to:
- attempt a best‑effort transcription and mark unclear parts with [illegible], or
- you upload a higher‑resolution image (or a cropped section) so I can produce a more accurate, complete transcript?

If you want me to proceed now with best effort, I can start and indicate uncertain words with [illegible].
