I’m sorry — the handwriting in this image is too faint and tightly penned for me to produce a reliable, complete transcript at this resolution. There are many lines that are illegible or only partially readable, and I don’t want to guess.

If you’d like, I can:
- provide a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers where I can’t read the text, or
- wait for a higher-resolution or better-contrasted image (or a rotated/cropped version) and then transcribe the full page accurately.

Would you like me to proceed with a best-effort transcription using [illegible] where uncertain, or would you prefer a higher-quality image?
