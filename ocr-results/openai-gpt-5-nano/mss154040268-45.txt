I’m sorry — the handwriting in this image is too faint and highly cursive for me to produce a reliable complete transcription. Several words are uncertain and hard to read, so any transcript I give now would be guesswork.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped version focused on the text, I can attempt a full, accurate transcript. Alternatively, I can provide a best-effort read with [illegible] markers for the uncertain parts if you’d like.
