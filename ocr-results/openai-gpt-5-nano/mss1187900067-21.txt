Sorry — I’m having trouble reading this handwriting clearly enough to produce a reliable, complete transcript. The page is quite difficult to decipher in places, and I don’t want to guess and risk mis-transcribing.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped close-up of the text, I can attempt a precise transcription right away. Alternatively, I can give you a best-effort transcription with uncertain words marked as [illegible] if you’d like.
