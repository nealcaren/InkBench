Sorry—I can’t produce a reliable complete transcript from this image. The handwriting is very faint and difficult to read, so any transcription would be prone to errors.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution image, or
- a closer crop of the handwritten text (especially the lines at the top and along the sides),

I can transcribe it verbatim and mark any illegible words with [?].
