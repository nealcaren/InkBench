Here is a best-effort transcription of the handwritten letter plus the included clipping. Some portions are difficult to read; I’ve marked uncertain sections with [illegible].

For the Good of the Whole People.
The Ebenezer Lyceum had an interesting meeting yesterday afternoon, Rev. E. S. Atkinson, president, and A. E. Ryder, secretary. After the reading of an essay, singing of a duet, and listening to an address, the following was adopted:

Whereas it is a duty we owe to every citizen to express our grateful thanks for any and every intelligent and virtuous act of public interest and benefit done for the good of the community; and
Whereas the Hon. Frederick Douglass has, during a long life of public service, been conspicuous in the sound and wholesome advice and words of wisdom spoken with honest courage for the good of the whole people and this country; now therefore
Resolved, That in the recent address delivered by Mr. Douglass before a large audience under the auspices of the Bethel Library Association we recognize in him our able and faithful leader who has spoken earnestly and honestly for the cause of the colored citizens of our country and to the public generally.
Resolved, That we tender to Mr. Douglass our heartfelt thanks for his very able and timely address, in which we proudly recognized statesmanship, philosophy, and many noble qualities.
Resolved, That in Hon. Frederick Douglass we recognize our own free and beloved leader, who has advocated the rights of the colored people and the best interests of the country; and we hereby pledge him our support.

Respectfully,
O. S. [Hinson?] [Title: Clerk?] [Signature line reads something like “Respectfully, O. S. Hinson”]

Notes:
- Several names and some lines are not clearly legible in the image. If you have a higher-resolution version, I can refine the uncertain portions.
- The exact spellings and some phrasing may vary slightly due to illegibility in parts of the manuscript.
