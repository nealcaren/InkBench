I’m happy to transcribe it, but this image is too small and the text is too faint to read reliably. I can’t provide a complete and accurate transcript from this version.

If you can supply:
- a higher-resolution image, or
- a crop of the text area (focused on the column headings and entries),

I’ll produce a precise, line-by-line transcript (preserving line breaks and any unclear parts with [illegible] where appropriate). For reference, the visible line at the bottom appears to read “BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA” and the page number shown is 22, but I can confirm the rest only with a clearer image.
