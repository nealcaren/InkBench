I’ll do my best with what’s legible, but parts are unclear. I’ve marked uncertain words with [illegible].

Right fragment (Block B):

ages as defined by section one, [illegible]
ce he shall have obtained the permit
required the refer by the laws of the
regulations ade the reunder.  has been found inadequate in destroying

Note: The two fragments appear to contain the same or very similar wording, with only small differences being legible. The last word of the first line in each fragment is unclear, and several other words are obscured.

Handwritten small sheet (bottom image)
A small handwritten fragment is visible, but most of it is not legible in this image. What is readable looks like a list of short words or names (e.g., a few repeated terms like “Griddly/Griddley” and a sequence that resembles days or brief notes), but the handwriting is too faint to transcribe reliably.

If you can share a higher-resolution version or a zoomed-in crop of the two printed fragments (especially the portions around the uncertain words), I can fill in the missing pieces and provide a complete, exact transcript.
