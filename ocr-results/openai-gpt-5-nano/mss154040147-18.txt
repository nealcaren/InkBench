I can try, but this page is very difficult to read due to the cursive handwriting and some bleed-through. I can provide a best-effort transcription with uncertain words marked, but some sections may be wrong. If you’d like, I can also re-check it at a higher resolution or with a rotated view.

Here is my best attempt (with unclear words in brackets):

never know, and though think him we are sending missionaries into these Heathen, I got so mad, […] away to Albany and tear the dome off the Capitol; The world is a curious mix, but surely and no one country has acted the liberal[ity]. The dollar is about converted to be a Buddhist! [Then] [I] sent the key of that tax and I [have] given one that cost […] if you will send this one. It’s going via Liverpool and I told them I didn’t care how long it took. For return, I think my Buddy […] friend will come to Budapest

If you can share a higher-res image or confirm some of the uncertain words, I’ll refine the transcription precisely.
