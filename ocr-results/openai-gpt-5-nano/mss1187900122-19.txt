Here is my best effort at a complete transcription of the handwritten item. Some sections are very difficult to read due to the cursive and fading; I’ve marked uncertain words with [illegible] and used brackets for unclear phrases.

London Sunday May 6, 94
Dear Mr. Douglass:

Your letter directed to Manchester has followed me around till it reached me here. I am indeed glad to get it. When I write I [illegible] had not seen your letter to [illegible]. I asked, since seeing it I know from what he said others said, that while they did not expect “gush” [nay they say you the same compliment I do, in knowing you to be incapable of such a thing] still they would have [illegible] better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. Mr. [illegible] thought that since the Society had failed so miserably and I was [illegible] left [illegible] better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. [illegible] the [illegible] since the Society had failed so miserably and I was thus left [illegible] [illegible] for myself. [illegible] 

[Another paragraph or two, largely illegible, continuing with references to “you would not” and comments about what was said by others, and opinions about the Society and plans.]
