I’m happy to transcribe this, but several parts of the handwriting are too unclear in this image to read reliably. I don’t want to guess the wording.

If you can provide a higher‑resolution version or a clearer scan, I’ll produce a complete, exact transcript. In the meantime, I can supply a partial transcription with [illegible] markers for the unreadable sections. Would you like me to do that?
