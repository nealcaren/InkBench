subject at length. I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing that opinion, and now lay the matter before you, and recommend you to take such steps as will preserve the rights and honor of the State. It may well be doubted if the officering of the whole of our troops does not belong exclusively to State authority, as by strict reference to the Constitution they may be found to be in point of law, militia. If mortifying to find entire brigades of North Carolina soldiers in the field commanded by strangers; and, in many cases, our own brave and war-worn Colonels are made to give place to Colonels from distant States, who are promoted to the command of North Carolina troops over their heads to vacant Brigadierships. Some of these promotions are charged to North Carolina, which enables the authorities to say that we have had so many appointments, when in fact we have notâ€”the appointees not being citizens of our State. This is fast breaking down the pride and patience of our officers, many of whom are reporting to me their intention to resign, alleging that the road to honorable promotion is almost closed to our citizens. This is not right, and forms a just cause of complaint both in our army and with our people at home. We are willing that our soldiers should follow any General capable of leading them, but we contend that as a matter of sheer justice, our soldiers are entitled to receive their fair proportion of the honors won by their gallantry and endurance.

I would also recommend that the existing prohibition against the distillation of spirits from all kinds of grain be continued during the war. There is no grain to spare for such purposes, and all the medical needs of the country and army can be abundantly supplied by the liquors made from the fruit crop. Should even the supply for the army fail, it cannot be doubted that it is much better for the soldier to go without spirits than that his wife and child should be without bread.

I also recommend that a law be passed providing for a rigid punishment of all persons who may be convicted of speculating in any of the necessaries of life, under the false pretence of being government agents.
