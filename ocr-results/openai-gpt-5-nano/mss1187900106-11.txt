Here is a best-effort transcription of the page. Some portions are unclear; I’ve marked uncertain words with [illegible].

Dear [illegible salutation]: Here I am, away up in the North West, on my first visit to my youngest daughter, Adelle, the wife of R. B. Scott, who happens to be absent, just now, in discharge of his official duties, at “Goosoo Lake,” in the “Okanagan Country,” as they call it here. For a year and a half, until two weeks ago, was almost a perfect blank in my life’s journey. To be blind, is a terrible calamity to any human being. Since the surgical operation, two months ago, which extracted the Cataract from my left eye, and then waiting for the soreness and sensibility, to light, to Subside, two weeks ago I got my new spectacles with [special] glasses mounted to my left eye, and now, with the aid of that glass, I can see almost as well as ever. So much for [C?] and for science. Thanks to Providence, [who has] man [discovery] and skill for my holding out so long. Nature has dealt kindly with you and me. We may yet become [illegible].
