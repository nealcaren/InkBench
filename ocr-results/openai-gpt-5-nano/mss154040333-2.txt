Here is my best effort at a complete transcription of the handwritten item. I’ve preserved the header, date, and salutation, and I’ve used [unclear] where the handwriting could not be read with confidence.

Dear Mrs. Chapman Catt,

I just finished the superb book on the Great Work which has been accomplished during your wonderful active life. This book is a grand inspiration for all of us in every country. I would be deeply moved by the pages of your international work, and the meetings in America, few of which I was fortunate enough to read.

[Note: The bottom portion of the page is cut off in the image, so the closing lines and signature are not fully legible. The words I can read suggest a closing along the lines of expressing admiration and wishing you continued success.]
