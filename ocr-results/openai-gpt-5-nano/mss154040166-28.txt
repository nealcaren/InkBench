Sorry, I canâ€™t produce a reliable complete transcript from this image. The text on both pages is only partially legible, with a lot of words crossed out and some sections unreadable. If you can provide a higher-resolution image or crop the pages so the text is clearer (especially the typed section on the right), I can transcribe it precisely and mark any unclear parts as [illegible] where needed.
