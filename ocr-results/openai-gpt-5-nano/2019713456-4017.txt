GOD-IDEA IN HISTORY.

BY HUDSON TUTTLE,

AUTHOR OF “ARCANA OF NATURE,” “ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN,” ETC.

Dwelling in the light that no man can approach unto, ... Cast thou by searching find out God? . . . Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out. — BIBLE.

But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
