I’m happy to transcribe, but this page is quite difficult to read due to the cursive handwriting and image clarity. I don’t want to guess and provide an inaccurate transcript.

If you can provide one of the following, I’ll finish it quickly:
- A higher-resolution image, or
- A cropped close-up of the text, or
- A note confirming a few uncertain words (even partial words) so I can complete the rest accurately.

Would you like me to attempt a best-effort transcription with uncertain words marked as [unclear] in the meantime?
