I’m happy to transcribe it, but the handwriting in this image is quite difficult to read clearly. I’m worried I’d misread many words. If you can provide a higher-resolution version or a cropped close-up of the text, I can produce a precise, line-by-line transcript.

If you’d like, I can also provide a best-effort transcription now with unclear words marked, e.g., [illegible], [?], or [unclear], so you can see where the gaps are. Would you prefer that approach?
