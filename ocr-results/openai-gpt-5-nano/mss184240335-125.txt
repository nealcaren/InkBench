I’m happy to transcribe it, but this page is very densely handwritten and a lot of words are hard to read even at this size. To ensure accuracy, I can do one of the following:

- Provide a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers wherever I can’t read a word.
- Wait for a higher-resolution image (or a clearer crop) and then transcribe the entire page verbatim.

Would you like me to proceed with a best-effort transcription and mark uncertain words as [illegible], or would you prefer a clearer image to ensure a full, exact transcript?
