Mr. B. F. Leighton,
Dear Sir:

Yours of the 6th inst was duly received, the contents of which was care- fully noted by Mr Lewis English.

In reply he desires me to say that he has no disposition, whatever, to make any change regarding a stone step on the premises referred to in your letter.

On the contrary, he desires Mrs Helen English attention called to the fact that said premises is in immediate need of improvements both in and out, the walls, the broken blinds, and especially the sanitary arrangements; make it almost intolerable.

It is badly in need of a coat of paint, which, in its conspicuous position, makes a most detectable appearance.

It is the only residence in that immediate neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to the Landlord.

Respectfully yours,
Joseph Douglass
