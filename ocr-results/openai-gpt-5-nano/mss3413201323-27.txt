I can do a full transcription, but the current image is too low-resolution to read reliably in many places. I donâ€™t want to guess and introduce errors.

Would you like me to:
- attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for uncertain words, or
- wait for a higher-resolution scan (or a sharper crop) of the page and then transcribe it completely?
