I can transcribe the document, but the handwriting is quite faint in places. Below is my best effort with unclear sections marked as [illegible].

World's Columbian Commission.
Office of the
Director-General of the Exposition.

CHICAGO, ILL. June 18th

My dear Mr. Dunlap:

I [am] for the East â€” con? tomorrow morning, & now I have put off to
lay my calling on you & Mr. Douglass that I shall be unable to [respond].
Do [me] the [courtesy] to [excuse] me for [my] [absences] to your wife for me. I remember
her with so much [kindness], in Paris. I hope [to meet] them [to] Chicago, later in the summer;
Then I will not fail to see you both, and the memorable [event] that [is] to be.

Very truly yours,

Thomas Stanton,
2 6 West 61st St.,
New York

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or specify the uncertain portions, I can refine the transcription further and fill in the missing words more accurately.
