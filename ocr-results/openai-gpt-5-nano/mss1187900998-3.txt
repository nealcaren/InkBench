Sorry — I can’t confidently read all of the handwriting on this page in its current image. The cursive text is quite faint and several words/figures are illegible, so a complete, accurate transcription isn’t possible from this view.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped version (especially the left page’s entries and the right page’s itemized list), I’ll produce a full, line-by-line transcription and mark any unclear portions as [illegible] or with [?] as appropriate.
