I can transcribe it, but this image is quite difficult to read due to handwriting and quality. If you can provide a higher‑resolution image or confirm that I should proceed with a best‑effort transcription using [illegible] markers for unclear sections, I’ll finish it.

Would you like me to:
- Provide a best‑effort transcription with [illegible] for the unreadable parts, or
- Wait for a clearer image before transcribing?
