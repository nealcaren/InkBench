Sorry — the handwriting in this image is too illegible for a reliable full transcription. I can attempt a best-effort transcription with many [unclear] markers if you’d like, or you can share a higher-resolution image (or a rotated/cropped version) and I’ll transcribe it verbatim. Which would you prefer?
