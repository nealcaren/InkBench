Notes:
- Some attribution lines after a title (e.g., illustrator or author) are a bit unclear in places; I preserved the wording as legibly as possible from the image.
- If you’d like, I can annotate the exact spots that are uncertain with [ illegible ] markers after you confirm which lines you want checked.
