Here is the best-possible transcription of the visible handwriting. Some words are faint and partially illegible, so I’ve marked uncertain portions with [illegible]:

G.O. F6

Pvt F Akins 1st South Carolina

Charge Mutinous Conduct

[illegible] to be shot to death

[illegible] to [home] look

Note: Several words are difficult to read on the image; the lines after “Charge Mutinous Conduct” are not clearly legible. If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a close-up of the lines, I can refine the transcription further.
