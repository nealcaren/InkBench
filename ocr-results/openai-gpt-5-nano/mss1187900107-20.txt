I’m sorry — the handwriting in this image is too faint for me to read accurately. I don’t want to guess and give you something misleading.

If you can provide a higher-resolution scan or a clearer crop (and ensure the page is upright), I can produce a complete, faithful transcription. Tips to improve readability:
- Increase contrast and brightness.
- Crop tightly around the text.
- Provide each page at its own crop (even if multiple pages exist, transcribe in order).
- If possible, scan at 300–600 dpi.

If you’d like, I can also attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers where the text is unclear, and you can confirm later.
