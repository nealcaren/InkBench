Dear Father,

Yours of the 4th inst. is just received. I saw an account of one of your lectures in New Jersey, published in the New York Tribune, and I thought that you might have other appointments, not hearing from you. All are well except the baby; he has a severe cold. Augusta is attending him, we are afraid he will have the cough; but hope not. I don’t wish to trouble your mind about the affair between Nathan and me, and my self I know your mind, and time is better occupied. You may know the cause of the difficulty; but I know you don’t know the whole truth, and it is hard to find out under the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone against us, look for another war. If you will be at home any length of time I will write again soon, as I am very busy just now. Libbie would send love, if she knew I was writing. Love to Mother and all.

Your aff. Son
