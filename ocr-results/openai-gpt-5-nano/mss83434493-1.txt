I’m sorry — the handwriting in this image is too faint for me to read reliably, and I don’t want to guess or provide an incorrect transcription.

If you can supply a higher-resolution version or a cropped close-up of the text area, I can provide a complete and accurate transcription. If cropping isn’t possible, a version scanned at 300–600 dpi or a direct upload of a clearer copy would help a lot.
