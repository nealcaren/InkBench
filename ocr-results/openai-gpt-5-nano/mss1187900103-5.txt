I can transcribe it, but the image is quite faint and the handwriting is difficult to read. To ensure accuracy I should either: 
- get a higher‑resolution version, or 
- proceed with my best guess and mark uncertain words as [illegible].

If you’d like me to proceed now, I’ll provide a best‑effort transcript with [illegible] markers for the unclear parts.
