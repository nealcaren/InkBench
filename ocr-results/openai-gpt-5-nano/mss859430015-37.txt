My dear daughter.— Miss Mack came yesterday and brought the box and visited with me awhile. She said she had a nice time up and working at home and clearing away weeds in the back and the like.

We were very glad to talk with you Sunday night. It helps Parker, felt we are doing very well at present. Brother and family are quite well. He doesn’t come so often now, is still working out at Jackson, and they are getting welfare there. I hope you are well and won’t overwork because you comes home. Now that school is out I suppose some of the children will be over to stay, much love from Mother.
