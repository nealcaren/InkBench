A FIRST-CLASS PERIODICAL,

and we willing to pay a fair price for such, while they insist that it shall not only contain the productions of the BEST AMERICAN WRITERS

who have distinguished themselves in the department of juvenile literature, but also that it shall be of the HIGHEST MORAL TONE.

The publishers of OLIVER OPTIC'S MAGAZINE, encouraged by the success of the past, will endeavor, in the coming volume, to meet the requirements of their patrons for such a work more perfectly than ever before, giving on their Trade List more than

TWO HUNDRED JUVENILE BOOKS,

written by the most popular authors, they are confident that their unrivalled facilities in this department will enable them to realize their ambition to furnish

THE CHEAPEST AND THE BEST MAGAZINE

for the young people in the United States. Their aim will still be to

IMPROVE THE MIND AND HEART,

and while the work shall amuse and entertain, it shall also impart valuable information to

ART, SCIENCE, AND LITERATURE,

and develop and encourage the purest morality. The publication will continue to be under the editorial supervision of OLIVER OPTIC, whose books for young people have now reached the unparalleled annual sale of

ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND VOLUMES.

AN EXCITING STORY,

which shall afford young readers no excuse for resorting to the dangerous trash so abundant as the present day, and depots for wise instruction and moral culture.
