I can transcribe whatâ€™s clearly legible, but the page is too low-resolution to confidently read most of the individual entries. Here is what I can confirm from the image:

Transcription
- 142 UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN
- NATCHEZ NATIONAL CEMETERY, MISSISSIPPI

Column headings (as they appear along the page):
- No.
- Name.
- Rank.
- Co.
- Regiment.
- Date of death.
- Sec.
- Grave.
- Original place of burial.

Legible items (only what is clearly readable):
- The header and column labels are readable as shown above.
- Some portions of names/entries are not legible in this image (marked here as unreadable).

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped section focused on the table (or a scan oriented the right way up with more contrast), I can deliver a full, line-for-line transcription of every row, with illegible words marked as [?].
