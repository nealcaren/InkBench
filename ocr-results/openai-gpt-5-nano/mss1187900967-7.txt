I’m ready to transcribe, but this image is too unclear for a reliable full transcription. Many words are faint or overlapping, and I don’t want to guess incorrectly.

Could you provide:
- A higher-resolution version, or
- A zoomed-in crop of the text area, or
- A second image of the same page with better contrast?

If you’d like, I can still attempt a best-effort transcription with [unclear] markers for the unreadable parts and note where I’m unsure.
