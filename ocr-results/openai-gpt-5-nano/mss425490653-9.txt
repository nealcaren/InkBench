Delegate to the International Peace Congress.

The following letter which was received one morning about the middle of December, 1918 thrilled me with surprise and joy. Dear Mrs. Terrell, it read, it gives me real pleasure to inform you that at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Peace Party, which in the section for the U.S.A. of the International Congress of Women for Permanent Peace, held in New York City November 24, you were elected as one of thirty delegates and alternates to the International Congress of Women which it was arranged to meet at The Hague in 1915 should meet at the time of the Peace Conference at the end of the War.

The letter stated that it was likely the meeting would be held either at Paris or The Hague and the time not be either the first week in February or early in May.

“We realize,” the letter concluded, “that this is not an easy journey which we are inviting you to take under crowded conditions, in winter, to a warm country. But we earnestly hope that your love of human welfare will minimize the difficulties and that you will be able to go with us.” Faithfully yours, Alice Thacker Post, secretary of delegates from the U.S.A.; Post was the wife of Mr. Louis Post who was then Secretary of Labor under President Wilson.

I was working for the War Camp Community Service at the time and was in the South trying to induce some of the committees of the large cities to sanction the establishment of centers for colored women and girls. After completing the summary of the conditions which obtained in these cities I sent it to headquarters and gave a leave of absence to go as a delegate to the Peace Congress which would be held in Europe. This was granted in the following letter: “My dear Mrs. Terrell: Thank you for the summary; it is a fine piece of work and the classification workers are delighted with it. It will help us materially in understanding the problems of the cities you visited. We wish to express our appreciation of the devoted service you have given during the past months, and will willingly grant you the leave of absence to enable you to make the important trip abroad. Wishing you success in your new undertaking, Very sincerely yours, (signed) Geo. L. Dickie, Director Field Department.”
