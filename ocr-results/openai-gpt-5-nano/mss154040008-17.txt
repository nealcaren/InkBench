I’m not able to produce an accurate transcription from this image in its current state. The handwriting is very light and overlapping, and the orientation makes reading difficult.

Could you provide:
- a higher-resolution scan, and/or
- the page rotated to read left-to-right (upright), and
- a crop if needed to exclude glare?

Once I have a clearer image, I’ll supply a complete transcript (with [sic] for uncertain words or brackets for illegibles as needed).
