quite anxious to see you both. That is me of the greatest difficulty about this place, I am unable to keep up with current events unless the papers are sent from home, and I miss reading the daily papers very much.

Hoping that I have not put your patience to a very severe test â€” and that you will favor me with an early reply, I will close, with much love I am,

Your aff. grand-daughter, Kattie.
