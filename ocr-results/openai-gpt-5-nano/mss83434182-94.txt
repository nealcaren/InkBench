I’m glad to help, but I can’t provide a reliable complete transcript from this image as-is. The text is very small and rotated, and I can’t clearly read the individual entries to transcribe them accurately.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution version of this page, or
- a cropped region with legible text (centered on the table and column headings),

I’ll produce a full line-by-line transcription.

What I can confirm from the current image:
- The page footer (appearing upside down) reads: “BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA” and the page number “68.”
- The page appears to be a roster or register with multiple columns (likely Name, Rank, Unit/Company, Regiment, etc.) and many rows, but the individual entries are not legible enough to transcribe accurately.

If you can re-upload a clearer version, I’ll transcribe every legible character exactly as written.
