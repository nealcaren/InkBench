I can try to transcribe this, but the handwriting is quite faint and many words are not clearly legible in this image. I don’t want to guess and misquote the text.

If you can provide a higher-resolution image (or a crop of the page) or confirm a clearer scan, I’ll produce a full transcription. In the meantime, I can mark clearly read sections and indicate uncertain parts with [illegible] or [unclear].

Would you like me to attempt a best-effort transcription with placeholders for the unreadable portions, or would you prefer you provide a better image first?
