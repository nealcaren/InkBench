I’m happy to transcribe this, but the image you provided is too faint/bleed-through to read reliably in several spots. To give you a complete, accurate transcript, I’d need a higher-resolution image or a cropped, higher-contrast version of the page.

If you can provide one, I will deliver a line-for-line transcript with [illegible] markers where appropriate.

What I can confirm now (header and date at least):
- MRS. MARY WARE DENNETT
  81 SINGER ST.
  ASTORIA, LONG ISLAND
  NEW YORK CITY

- May 21, 1935

- Dear Mrs. [illegible]:

From the rest of the page, there are many words that are too faint for confident reading. With a crisper image I will transcribe the full text exactly as written, including punctuation and any marginal notes.
