Here is a best-effort transcription of the legible text on the page. The form is largely blank with only the header text readable; many parts are not legible in this image, so I’ve left uncertain areas as [illegible].

(Form No. 13.)

MUSTER ROLL of Captain [illegible], Company ( [illegible] ) of the [illegible] Regiment of the United States Army. (Colonel [illegible] ), from the [illegible] day of [illegible], 186–, when last mustered, to the [illegible] day of [illegible], 186–.

PAY ROLL of the Company from the [illegible] day of [illegible], 186–, when last paid, to the [illegible] day of [illegible], 186–.

[The remainder of the page contains column headers and a large grid for names, dates, and notes, but these fields are currently blank or illegible in this image.]

If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a crop that shows the header area more clearly, I can supply a more exact and complete transcription of the entire item.
