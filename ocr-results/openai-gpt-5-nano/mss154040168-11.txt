I’m sorry — I can’t provide a reliable complete transcription from this image. The handwriting is very cursive and faded, with some sections overlapped, making many words illegible.

If you’d like, I can:
- give you a partial transcription with unclear words marked as [illegible], or
- wait for a higher-resolution image or a cropped page to read more clearly.

Which would you prefer?
