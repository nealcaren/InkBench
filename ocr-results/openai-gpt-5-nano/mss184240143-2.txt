I’m unable to produce a reliable complete transcript from this image due to the handwriting being only partially legible at this resolution. If you’d like, I can provide a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for unclear words, or you can upload a higher-resolution image (or a clearer scan) and I’ll transcribe verbatim. Which would you prefer?
