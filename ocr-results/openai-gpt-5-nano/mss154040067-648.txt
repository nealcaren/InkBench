Here is what I can read clearly from the image. The rest appears to be a long list of individual sponsor names that are too small/blurred to transcribe reliably at this resolution.

[The rest of the page appears to be a two-column list of individual sponsor names (e.g., MRS., MISS, etc.). The lines are very small and largely illegible in this image, so Iâ€™m not able to provide an accurate, complete transcription of the names themselves without a higher-resolution scan.]

If you can provide a higher-resolution image (or a crop that focuses on the sponsor lists), I can give you a full, exact transcription of every line in the sponsor lists.
