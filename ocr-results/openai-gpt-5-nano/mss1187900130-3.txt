I did a best-effort transcription of the handwritten telegram, but parts of the cursive are quite difficult to read. I’ve marked clearly uncertain spots with [illegible] and left the clearly readable portions as written.

If you’d like, I can try again with a higher-resolution image or a closer crop to improve readability of the faint cursive and fill in more of the missing words.
