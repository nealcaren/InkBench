Notes:
- Several words are faint or stylistically written in a way that is not clearly legible, so I’ve indicated them with [illegible] or [word unknown].
- The overall layout seems to be a card or notebook entry with names/addresses and a note about sending a photograph, along with Dayton, Ohio, and a street address line.
