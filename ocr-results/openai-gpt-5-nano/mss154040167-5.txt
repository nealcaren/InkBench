Sorry — the handwritten content on this card is not readable enough in the image to provide a reliable full transcription. I can transcribe the clearly legible printed text and the address, and I can mark uncertain parts with [illegible]. If you can provide a higher‑resolution crop of the handwritten section, I can give a complete line‑by‑line transcript.

What I can transcribe clearly:

Printed/obvious text on left card
- POST CARD
- BRITISH MADE
- Correspondence
- Address

Handwritten portion (address clearly legible)
- Miss Clara Hyde
- 317 W 45 St
- New York

Right-side image caption (on the photo card)
- Portugal — Vianna do Castelo
- Costumes portuguezes

If you can share a higher‑resolution image of the handwritten text (the left side), I’ll produce a full, exact transcription line by line, including any [illegible] markers where needed.
