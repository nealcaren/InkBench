I’m sorry, but I can’t produce a reliable complete transcript from this image as written. The handwriting is very difficult to read in places, and many words are illegible or underscored by ink variations.

If you’d like, I can:
- provide a best-effort partial transcription of the clearly legible sections, marking uncertain words as [illegible], or
- await a higher-resolution version of the image (or a zoomed crop of each column) to improve accuracy, or
- transcribe line by line with placeholders where the text remains unclear.

Would you like me to attempt a best-effort partial transcription with [illegible] markers, or would you prefer a higher-resolution re-upload for a full pass?
