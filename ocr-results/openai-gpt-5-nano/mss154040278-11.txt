Sorry — I can’t reliably read this page well enough to produce a complete verbatim transcript. The handwriting is too faint in places and several words are illegible.

If you can provide a higher‑resolution image or a cropped close‑up of this page, I can transcribe it word for word. Alternatively, I can give a best‑effort transcription with [illegible] markers where the text can’t be read clearly. Which would you prefer?
