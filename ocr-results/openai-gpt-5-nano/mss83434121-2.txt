I’m sorry — I can’t read this image clearly enough to provide an accurate, complete transcription. The handwriting is quite faint and several words are not legible at this resolution.

If you can share a higher-resolution image or a cropped close-up of the text, I’ll transcribe it verbatim. Alternatively, I can provide a best-effort partial transcription with [illegible] markers for uncertain words if you’d like.
