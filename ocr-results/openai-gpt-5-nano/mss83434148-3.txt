I can read the header and the printed/clear lines, but several parts of the handwritten text are too faded to decipher confidently. Here is the best-possible transcript with unreadable sections marked.

Transcript (with unreadable portions indicated)

No. 27.

No. 4 ABSTRACT E. [illegible] 1865.

LIST OF STORES RECEIVED FROM
[signature in pencil, illegible]
Genl. C. McClurk? [or similar]
Cmdl. Lt. 29th? U. S. Army, Quartermaster U. S. Army,
at [illegible] the United States [illegible].

Notes:
- The handwriting around the signature line is not clearly legible; the surname could be “McClark,” “McClurk,” or similar, and the preceding title initials are uncertain.
- The line ending with “Quartermaster U. S. Army” is legible, but the lines after that (location stamps like “at the …”) are too faint to read.
- If you can provide a higher-resolution crop of the central area or a rotated version, I can try to refine and complete the transcription.
