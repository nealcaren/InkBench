I can transcribe it, but the image is quite low resolution which makes many words illegible. I donâ€™t want to guess and provide an inaccurate transcript.

Would you like me to:
- attempt a best-effort transcription using [ ? ] for clearly unreadable words, or
- wait for a higher-resolution image (or a clearer scan) to produce an exact transcription?
