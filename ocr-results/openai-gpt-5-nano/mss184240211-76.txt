I’m having trouble reading this page clearly—the handwriting is very cursive with words crossed out and several sections illegible at this resolution. I don’t want to guess and give you a wrong transcription.

If you’d like, I can:
- provide a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers for uncertain words, or
- wait for a higher-resolution or better-cropped image (or rotated properly) and then transcribe precisely.

Would you like me to attempt a best-effort transcription with [illegible] markers, or upload/attach a clearer image?
