Lynn Mass. Dec. 1/81

Editor Woman’s Journal,

Dear Madam,

Enclosed you will find $2.50, which I send to pay for the Woman’s Journal, to be sent to my address, for one year. I have hitherto received the papers through a friend, but I think I will have one of my own now, so that I can have some to give away.

I received your letter last Monday, and I wish to thank you for your evidently careful perusal of my manuscript, and for your friendly criticism of my work. I feel more encouraged by your commendations.
