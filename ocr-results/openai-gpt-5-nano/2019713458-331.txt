Sorry — I can’t reliably read enough of this image to provide a complete transcription. The handwriting is faint and the orientation/contrast make many words illegible. If you can share a higher‑resolution version or re-upload with the page oriented upright and better contrast, I’ll transcribe it verbatim (marking uncertain words as [unreadable] or [bracketed] as you prefer).
