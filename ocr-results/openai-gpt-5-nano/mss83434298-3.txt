I can provide the parts that are legible, and mark the unclear sections. The image is quite faint, so several words and numbers are not readable with certainty.

Notes:
- Several lines and the exact names/dates are not legible in the image.
- The central portion appears to be a typical Civil War era voucher layout (dates, subsistence, forage, clothing, total amount), but the exact figures and names require a higher-resolution image to transcribe precisely.

If you can provide a higher-resolution crop of the central block or confirm any of the faint words (especially the recipientâ€™s name and the dates), I can finalize a precise transcript.
