Sorry, I’m having trouble reading this page clearly enough to provide an accurate, complete transcription. The handwriting is quite faint and some words are unclear.

Could you upload a higher-resolution version or a sharper crop of this page? Even a slightly zoomed-in version (or a scan at a higher DPI) would help me produce a precise transcription. If you’d like, I can also attempt a best-effort read now and mark the uncertain parts with [illegible].
