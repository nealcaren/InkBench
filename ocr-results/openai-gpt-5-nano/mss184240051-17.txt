I’m sorry — I can’t confidently read this image enough to produce a complete transcript. The handwriting is very small and tightly spaced, and many words are not legible at this resolution.

If you can provide a higher-resolution version (or a cropped close-up of the text), I can transcribe it fully. Alternatively, I can provide a best-effort partial transcription with [illegible] markers for the unclear parts. Let me know how you’d like to proceed.
