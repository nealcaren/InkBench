RECONSTRUCTION:

A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE L. STEARNS.

ELMER, SALEM CO., N. J. Feb. 27, 1865.

Sir,— I lately received from you two communications, in which you advance certain propositions, and ask my influence and support for them.

1st. To organize the anti-slavery men of the country.

2d. To bring their combined influence to bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the social and political institutions of the Rebel States, and to remodel our financial system, in order to correct abuses growing out of slavery.

3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew, Massachusetts, as seat in the Cabinet at Washington, as an able and faithful exponent of anti-slavery principles and measures.

I reply — I am not acquainted with the peculiar abuses of our “financial system” growing out of slavery, nor aware that some champion of freedom might not be as proper as the present occupant to fill the Cabinet, etc.
