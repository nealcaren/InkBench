had amassed for them a fortune of nearly $150,000, was not as grateful to them as true. His mistress, however, always treated him as kindly as she dared. On the approach of our armies, he remained till all had left but himself and family. Being assured by our officers that the President's Proclamation was true, he also quietly came in. Spirited and proud, he is the most humble of all. He refuses to sit in the presence of whites, and touches his hat to you at every address.”

(From a recent speech of ex-Governor Wright of Indiana.)

“As to the cant about the negro's ability to take care of himself, he had these facts to relate, and he would do so without comment: In 1862, the rebel Legislature of South Carolina raised a committee to inquire into the expediency of enfranchising the 5,000 free negroes of Charleston. That committee reported against it, and stated that those 5,000 free negroes paid into the treasury of Charleston annually $27,000, and that their property amounted to $1,500,000. Out of that amount of property $300,000 worth of it was composed of slaves. That the 9,000 free negroes of New Orleans in 1860, were worth as much per capita as the white people of Louisiana; that these free negroes had their own schools, their own benevolent societies, &c. These facts, he contended, proved that the free negro was capable of taking care of himself. He also stated that a lady who owned 500 negroes in 1860 told him that she had lost them all but 200 by the beginning of 1864. That year she made a contract with them to cultivate her farm on the shares; and that last year, under such a system, where the negro was working for himself as well as for his mistress, the 200 made her more money than 500 had done in slavery.”
