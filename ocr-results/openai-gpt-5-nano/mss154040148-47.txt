I can provide a transcription, but the handwriting is quite difficult to read in places. Here is my best effort with uncertain words marked.

1 Port of Spain
Mech 26, 1923

My dear Mollie: I gave you hope for a cable and money is here. We remain anxious day but I suspect that progress is in the direction of recovery and that you have not called it off.

Mech 27. I was overwhelmed here and now there are changes in my different and time has passed your cable has been renewed, and it was such a relief to think it. I imagine you passing through that discouraging stage when you think you never shall be well again and when life has lost all its power. But keep up your courage and you’ll pull through. I am so glad you are better. This world must be a [illegible] place without your dear Mother.

Note: Several words and phrases in the middle of the page are not clearly legible, particularly the exact wording around “Mech 27,” the description of changes and the exact line about the cable, and the final couple of lines. If you can provide a higher-resolution image or a cropped section focused on the text, I can refine this transcription further and replace uncertain words with [unclear] markers.
