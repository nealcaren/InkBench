I can transcribe this, but the image is a bit too small to read all lines clearly. To provide a precise, complete transcript, I need a higher-resolution version (or at least a closer crop of the page).

Would you like me to:
- proceed now with a best-effort transcript and mark unclear sections as [illegible], or
- wait for a higher-res image so I can produce a more exact full transcription?
