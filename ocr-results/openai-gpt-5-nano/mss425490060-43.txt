Here is my best effort transcription of the handwritten page. I have marked uncertain portions with [illegible].

hiccough and was very near death, when a visitor to him, [Or Biggs], went our dentist there said he could cure him, and put one drop of turpentine on his nare. The hiccough stopped and he is up and about to-day. The doctor had tried every thing without aid, and as this can not possibly harm him I thought you might try it for your husband! They have too few men of the calibre of Judge Terrell, to lose there if anything can be done to ease them, and I trust by the time this reaches you, you will not need this or any other remedy that your husband will be able to take home, and I trust by the time this reaches you you will not need this or any other remedy that your husband will be able to recover.
