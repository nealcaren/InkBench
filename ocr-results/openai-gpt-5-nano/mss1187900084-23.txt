I can transcribe it, but the image is quite faint and the left-hand page is rotated, making many words illegible. I don’t want to guess and risk giving you an incorrect transcript.

Would you like me to:
- provide a best‑effort transcription with unclear words marked as [illegible] or [unsure], or
- wait for a higher‑resolution image (or a clean scan) to produce a full, exact transcript?

If you’d like a best-effort now, I can start with the clearly legible portions (noting where I’m unsure) and indicate where the handwriting is too faint to read.
