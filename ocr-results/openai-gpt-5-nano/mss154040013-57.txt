We arrived at our Peking Hotel about 3 and did not go out again. On Sunday we lunched with Minister and Mrs. Calhoun. We enjoyed looking at the embroideries and curios they had picked up. I conclude that the Legations in Peking are hot beds of gossip. Here we learned that the story told by the wife of the Dutch minister and the Secy of the Italian Legation about the Empress Dowager is untrue. That when the Government gets the Summer Palace in a proper state of repair to be habitable all the year around, she will be asked to go there. Mr. Calhoun said that the Treasury has never given an accounting of the Â£5,000,000 it borrowed from the Belgians, although the National Council had implored it to do so, and the Legations had assured the Government that it would never secure foreign confidence until it did. Naturally this gives grounds for the rumor that it was spoils and that Dr. Sun got his big slice. I also learned that when the Revolution began the American Government moved to maintain neutrality and that no country should take any action concerning China without the consent of the others. This it did in order to protect China from the depredations of those Nations which had designs upon her. This now keeps the U.S.A. from acknowledging her independence, as she must now wait for the others. Perhaps she will be outwitted in the game as certainly England always seems to hold the trump.
