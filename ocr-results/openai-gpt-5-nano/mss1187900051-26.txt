Friend Douglas.

I started from Rochester yesterday morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake. Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp holes north of the Rush Reservoir. I attached a pocket instrument upon the wire and communicated with the person who took my place during my absence. He telegraphed me the substance of your postal card. Before I left home I read your telegram, and went to the Rock Sav. Bank, where the draft was procured and notified them of its non reception, and if your wish for a duplicate, They said that they could not give another until they had received theirs from the Clearing House at NY, which would be the first week [in May / in August / in September] â€¦ [text cut off]
