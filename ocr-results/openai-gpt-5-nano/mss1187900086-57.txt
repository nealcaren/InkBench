My dear Bassett,

Soon after your previous excellent letter, and before I could see him about the Consultation & Dr. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, without notice or warning, departed from Washington for Bar Harbor, where he now is and is decided to remain till October; at least to say the papers. He evidently formed the climate of Washington at this season, combined with the pressure of the office seekers to much for him.

In my last interview with him, I was convinced that time, toil, and society, had made inroads upon his health and constitution; and that he must either take rest, or rest would take him.

For this, and other reasons, knowing that a personal interview with him would be far better for us than writing them, I have not mentioned the Dr. Thomas proposal to him as yet. The President too, is so much out of the city, going as often and staying as briefly in the city, and giving his time so exclusively when here that the members of his Cabinet, that I have been unable to see him since Mr. Blaine left.
