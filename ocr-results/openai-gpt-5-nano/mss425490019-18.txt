I’m not able to provide a reliable complete transcript from this image. The handwriting on the page is overlapped by writing from the back, making most of the lines difficult to read accurately, and I don’t want to guess and misinterpret the text.

If you can provide:
- a higher-resolution image, or
- a crop that focuses on the front side with less back-writing (or remove the back side),

I can produce a precise, line-by-line transcription. Alternatively, I can annotate the parts I can read with [illegible] for the uncertain sections once you share a clearer image.
