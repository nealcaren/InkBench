I’m sorry — I can’t produce a reliable complete transcript from this image as it’s currently shown. The handwriting is small and densely written, the page is rotated, and many words are not clearly legible at this resolution.

If you can provide any of the following, I’ll transcribe it fully:
- A higher-resolution version of the page, or
- A rotated (upright) version, or
- A cropped area focusing on the columns/text you want transcribed

I can then give you a precise, line-by-line transcription (including any unclear words marked with [?] where necessary).
