I’m afraid the handwriting in this image is too faint and convoluted for a reliable full transcription at this resolution. I can provide a best-effort reading with illegible parts marked, but it may not be fully accurate. If you can upload a higher-resolution or better-rotated version, I can produce a more complete and exact transcript.

Best-effort transcription (with uncertain words in [brackets]):

[Line 1]
[unreadable] to tell her about
the League [is crowd-faced]?

[Line 2]
We are meeting tomorrow
to come to [definite] conclusions about the
[design], [in] scope, etc.,

[Line 3]
For the Memorial Tablet
in Washington on which
the National [House] [Roll?]
names are to be placed.

[Line 4]
Your plan to have [the ?]
narrative take place at the [hours] of our Council

[Line 5]
meeting in Washington? I am
very [grateful] to you.

If you can share a sharper image or confirm any unclear sections, I’ll adjust and provide a precise, line-by-line transcript.
