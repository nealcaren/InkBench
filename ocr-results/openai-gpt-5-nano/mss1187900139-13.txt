Sorry — I can’t read this image well enough to provide a fully reliable complete transcript. The handwriting is quite faint in many places, and several words are not clearly legible.

If you’d like, I can give you a best-effort transcription with uncertain parts marked as [illegible] or [word not legible], or you can share a higher‑resolution version and I’ll transcribe again.

Here is a best‑effort partial transcription with [illegible] for the unclear sections:

Honorable
James G. Blaine

Sir, I have the honor to ask the favor of a leave of absence from your Department, beginning on the 20th of June, [illegible] the time required to reach Washington and [the time to] again reach [Port ???], if the latter shall be [deemed] my duty.

I am required to state in their request for leave of absence, the [number] of days I was absent from my post during the preceding year. I have [faithfully] complied with this instruction by referring you to my dispatch No. 95 dated Dec. 18th 1869, in which it is stated: “I left Portland, Maine on the 19th July and on the 28th of that month arrived at my home in the District of Columbia. On the 3rd Oct I was fully prepared and expected to go to start on my return to my post by the steamer leaving [New York] next day.” 

[End of legible portion; rest of text is too unclear for an accurate read.]

If you can provide a higher‑resolution image or a closer crop, I’ll complete the transcription precisely.
