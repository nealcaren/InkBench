WRECKS

AND

RESCUES.

By an EARLY MEMBER of the BOARD of MANAGERS of the A. F. G. S.

REVISED BY THE PUBLISHING COMMITTEE.

LIFE's ocean has its wrecks–o'er which we weep–
Strewed 'long the coast and foundered in the deep;
Its rocks and shoals, the treacherous calm beneath,
Its stormy blasts, that spread destruction–death.
It has its RESCUES too–for Christian hands
Stand on the shores of time, with outstretched hands,
To succor th' imperiled, and to save
From dangers here, and death beyond the grave.

NEW YORK:
AMERICAN FEMALE GUARDIAN SOCIETY,
