fired upon to draw me into the Street at
midnight to murder me and my officers
saying if we get the officers it will not
be long to fix the niggers and with the
most positive evidence that the train which
was to convey my Regt. to Charleston which
was accordingly done and repeated threats
to the effect that no one of them d-d niggers
officers should ever reach the Coast alive then
said to this that after I reached Newbury and
while getting my Regt. into camp for the
night I was fired at the ball passing near
my head of few moments after which I was told
by a Colored man and of the town
camp that night-without a Strong Guard with one
as he heard the men who had fired the Shot-
Say that they intended to kill the Col of that
