SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING

THE RETURN OF
WOMEN AS POOR LAW GUARDIANS.
___

Reasons for having Ladies as Poor Law Guardians.

_

Because the larger number of Paupers are women and children.
Because the great evil of Pauperism can only be diminished
by more care in the bringing up of children.

_

Because the girls brought up in Pauper Schools require the
superintendence of ladies to ensure their better training for
domestic work.

_

Because experience has shown their utility in the Unions where
ladies have been elected as Poor Law Guardians.

_

Because so many women are Ratepayers that they should be
represented by women as well as by men.

_

Because ladies are accustomed to visit among the Poor, and
are well acquainted with their requirements.

_

Because ladies have leisure and can give careful attention to
matters brought before the Boards of Guardians.

_

Because many of the women who are brought before Guardians
ought to be dealt with only by their own sex.

_

Because ladies being accustomed to household management
are certain to exercise rigid economy in details.

_

For these reasons the support of the ratepayers to
secure the election of a fair proportion of women as
Poor Law Guardians is earnestly requested.
