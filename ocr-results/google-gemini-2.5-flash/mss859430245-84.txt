The Spectrum in Philadelphia is packed with NSA members as the organiza- tion holds its 24th General Meeting with nationwide representatives.

The New Freedom Bell is rung heartily to open the NSA General Meeting, which saluted the City of Philadelphia and the United States Constitution.

In presenting the bell, Mr. Wil- liams exclaimed, “Long live the Constitution! Long live the City of Philadelphia! Long live freedom!”
Mayor Goode said he was “proud to accept this gift of free- dom.” It is a reminder, he said, “of the fifty-five men who came to- gether here two hundred years ago to give us the Constitution that has influenced the course of democra- cy around the world.”

Then, he and Mr. Williams rang the New Freedom Bell seven times, tolling it “high and loud” in the city to which it was dedicated on this summer’s evening.

After viewing the parade, which featured a great percentage of NSA groups, Frank Conforti of the Philadelphia Police Depart- ment remarked, “It’s great to see young people with a clear look in their eyes. If all the youth of Amer- ica could have the glow that these kids have, we’d have no problems in this country.”

Added William Marrazzo, city commissioner for the Water De- partment: “I’m overwhelmed by the obvious spirit of NSA, which conveyed the connection between very positive values and putting them into action. I’m particularly glad that my children were here to see this.”

July 4, Philadelphia, Pennsyl- vania: This was NSA’s day. Some 7,500 members from throughout the fifty states gathered at the Spec- trum for the organization’s 24th General Meeting. The New Freedom Bell was also present, as was Phila- delphia Mayor Goode and local U.S. Congressman Thomas Foglietta.

The scene was bathed in patri- otic hues. The entire arena had been transformed into a replica In-

dependence Hall. The hall’s chan- delier, enlarged tens of times, hung from the rafters, courtesy of the NSA stage crew. The stage itself was a huge replica of the chair used by George Washington when he presided over the Constitutional Convention, again a product of the stage crew. Around the circumfer- ence of the building hung window frames; through these peered the faces of the Founding Fathers, along with that of Soka Gakkai In- ternational President Daisaku Ike- da. The delegates, as they chose to view themselves, were all dressed as colonial patriots. Indeed, the scene was set for a resounding af- firmation of the principles which set America free, and which now can be extended and refined to the point of securing life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all hu- manity.

Both Mayor Goode and Con- gressman Foglietta showed up in business suits, in contrast to the costumes of the members. Once the New Freedom Bell rang to com- mence the proceedings, however, the two dignitaries were swept up in the tide of events. Congressman Foglietta, who along with Mayor Goode had viewed the NSA cultur- al presentation preceding the Gen- eral Meeting, remarked, “Never have I ever seen anything like the coordination, dedication and en- thusiasm that you have brought to the City of Philadelphia today.” Mayor Goode continued his thoughts by saying, “I am delighted to have you in our city. You brought something new here. You brought enthusiasm!” The two of them then donned colonial garb and heartily rang the New Freedom Bell with General Director Williams.
