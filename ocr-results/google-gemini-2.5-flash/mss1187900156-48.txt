of the diffusion and distribution of Haitian exhibits is, that
Haiti would thereby compete with other countries in the particu-
lar products of the same kind and would be entitled to receive

a efficient [from Haiti]
quantity of each class of exhibits [properly selected and shown from Haiti] so as to enable the Commission-
er to amply furnish a single booth, [and at the same time have enough. booths provided for the purpose] and at the same time have e-
enough, [enough] to distribute, among the different classes of productions
enough to compete with the same products from other countries [with which they may be affeliated.]

With the highest consideration,

Your obedient servant,
