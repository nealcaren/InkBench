To the Speakers Bureau:

Those roses were sweet, beautiful, temper dispelling, but
Roses Sind Verboten.
Keep your money to defend the suit to vindicate my
character. Please don't disobey orders again.
I have a vile temper, growing viler every day which
shows what politics can do for a woman &
is a daily comfort to witness the peaceably of
the Speakers Bureau!
