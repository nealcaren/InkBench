and sentimentalisms? On what
could the Kenneth Rayners, &
the members of the press expend
their eloquence?
If we press Mrs. Miller & her
steamboat: Mr. Douglass & his wife
into the compass of a syllogism,
& prove logically that "United
States citizens have a right
to choose their own modes &
employments. Half the misery
speaking in this country,
& a sector of mankind,
as to class privileges, might be ended.  I hail
the day when, in the disempure
of human rights. exact & equal
justice will be demanded for all
without distinction of race or sex.
With my kind regards to your
wife, & my best wishes for
your happiness.
Very sincerely yours,
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
