Hartford, Connecticut,
ALBERT H. WALKER,
COUNSELOR AT LAW,
(Including Patent Causes.)
#th if the colored leaders take
to announcing the Supreme Court,
they will alienate the sympathies
of their best friends in the North,
The abolition of slavery & the
prohibition of discriminating
State laws & the extension of
the ballot to the colored man:
these are secure. So to the colored
leaders denounce any folly for
not also furnishing by law, the
unauthorized and [?] exclusion
of colored people from
particular private [?] by
suit at hotels & theatres, it
will look rather childish. It
will tend to show that the colored
people can move for the show
than for the substance of citizenship.
