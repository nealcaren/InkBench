"Party Clean-ups Are the Crying Need"
Says
Carrie Chapman Catt
Distinguished Suffrage Leader

WANTED, feminism in politics. Emily Newell Blair says so. Mrs. Blair, sunny tempered, broad-visioned and one time hopeful, confesses herself (in her recent Journal articles) to be pessimistic and discouraged about women in politics. Her conclusions are drawn from seven years’ experience and hard work as vice-chairman of the National Democratic Committee.
She admits that women vote, sit in conventions and serve one committee, but instead of supporting independently their own ideas and policies, she charges that they have been widely guilty of merely doing what men want them to do and of voting as men direct them. Mrs. Blair finds that women have created no progressive action for their parties and that women form no bloc of political power.
Perhaps. But there is a twin comment and one should not be made without the other. The masses of men, also, fail to support independently their ow ideas and policies and they walk up the chalk line to vote exactly as their higher-ups tell them to; in fact, men and women behave so much alike in politics that to comment should be confined to the admission that the great masses of men and women have not really grown up and are more or less in leading strings.
A Republican woman in high political leadership has been known to express views so similar to Mrs. Blair’s as to reveal the fact that the same sad thing

that has happened in one party has also occurred in the other.
Mrs. Blair suggests that the remedy is the application of more feminism. I believe this is the comment of the other two ways only in which women may come in effective in political organization.
But is the feminism a revival of something we once had or is it a brand-new attitude for which modern politics is yearning? Personally, while I agree with Mrs. Blair in many of her comments, I do not think her diagnosis is correct.

THE fact is that when the new women voters walked through the opened door into American politics there was one great crying need throughout the nation and that was for a thorough party cleaning. The parties have not been cleaned yet and, apparently are as much in need of it as on the day women were enfranchised.
Said Professor McMaster, of the University of Pennsylvania, under the title, The Political Depravity of the Fathers: "A very little study of long forgotten politics will suffice to show that in filibustering and gerrymandering, in stealing using force at the polls, in colonizing and

in distributing patronage to whom patronage is due, in all the frauds and tricksters that go to make up the worst form of practical politics, the men who founded our state and national government and who were at one time our political leaders, were always our equals and often our masters."
So the years passed. Votes were bought, nominations were engineered, legislation was passed or lost by political strategy, statesmen degenerated into politicians, poor men made fortunes in politics and the price of politics has flown so high that it must be paid for with continual investigation.
There is a Tammany Hall in New York, a Republican machine in Chicago, and Philadelphia, which is even worse. Neither men nor women have yet attempted to remove the dishonest and indecent attempts to cover up the wicked things that have been done. No feminism in politics and no masculinity in or out of politics can contribute half so much to American self-government until the voters within the nation drop every other question and devote themselves to the institution of honesty and decency in the administration of party politics. We Shall never be a national party worthy of the respect of our own citizens and their neighbors, until this meaning is thoroughly done. Every last trick, every over-expenditure,

every purchased office, must be recognized by all voters as a political crime and political honesty must be made the common standard of all parties before any simple remedy can be applied effectively.
A wide cry from women of all parties that they will no longer support a party that is dishonest, covers graft, or guarantees profit to certain of its men, would startle the nation and the world; it now exist. It would put the right kind of feminism into politics and take out the wrong kind of masculinity. Instead of more women in office and more women effectively working in the parties, the great need is a crusade conducted by men and women against the positive wickedness of their parties.
Suppose Mrs. Blair and her friends, a Republican and her friends, conduct a Round Table upon these questions:
Are women getting out of politics all they should?
Are women giving to politics all that they might?
Does politics call for more feminism, less masculinity, or more decency?
When the conclusion has been reached, there will be need of another Round Table to answer the next question:
How shall the result wanted be attained?
