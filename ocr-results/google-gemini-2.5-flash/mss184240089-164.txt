if you will but keep
the eye of your own
Spirit turned Within -
<del>for it is not within (<del>nor without</del>) that</del>
the precious jewel of
truth & light is to
be sought – & found –
And darling – you
will find it, & wear
it – and live it – and
all men & women shall
call you blessed –
love to thee & dearg [?]
