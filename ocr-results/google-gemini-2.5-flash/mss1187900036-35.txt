Dear Friend. I expect
no rest. I look for no
rest. I look for no
calm to pass. Labor - 
cares - trials have been
my lot. Since I can remember
the clouds which have
overshadowed my life
from its fiery birthring
seem to become more
threatening as I travel on
but I do not dread

life has some resemblance
to yours. beloved friend
often makes me happy.
In the midst of tribulation
I like to to tread the
same path you are
treading. I would not
have to gotten place - 
where there I have been
