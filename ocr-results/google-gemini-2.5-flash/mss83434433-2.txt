Dear Sir
I have thought of an expedient to bring
in Caroline which I submit to you. It is that Gene
Mosely is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi
Now if you would disperse with Janet & see Gene all
& let her go & stay his negro & get it out that he has bought
her. it would I am sure bring her in & lets it be out
that it is an arrangement of mine over which you have
no control: What do you think of it? Let me know.
Yr truly
Mr O'Neile
