168 PENNSYLVANIA HISTORY

was still unknown. Things were soon to change, however. After Grant's regrettable assault at Cold Harbor on June 3, he decided to move aronnd Lee's right flank, cross the James River, and strike Petersburg from Bermuda Hundred. By June 15 Grant himself had arrived at Bermuda Hundred where almost 50.0OO troops were preparing to cross the Appomattox River for the projected at-tack. Early on the morning of the 15th Major General William F. Smith's l8th Corps, previously detached from the Anny of the James to assist at Cold Harbor, began the advance. Crossing the Appomattox at the Point of Rocks an the pontoon bridge the 6th Regiment had been protecting, Smith's tr00ps passed by this unit's camp. The 6th followed immediately, joining some nine regiments of a colored division under General Hinks. The puzzling events of June 15 were by this time well under way.
Smith's corps, consisting of his own and Hinks' division, numbered at least 12,000 men.' Hinks' division of about S,OOO was composed of three brigades. Of these, Duncan's 2nd, consisting of the 4th, Sth, 6th, and 22nd regiments, totalled in the neighborhood of 2,200. Hinks took his men along the main mad. Smith moved his division of over 6,000 to the right of the road, so as to face the Petersburg defenses near the Appomattox River. By 10:OO a.m. the corps was before the City's works, Smith having the advantage of a position in a wood and Hinks being protected by a slight rise in the ground between himself and the Rebel line. Opposing the blueoats was a thin band of troops numbering ab0ut 2,20O. Until late in the day the corps' action consisted of several minor, though sharp skirmishes, those involving the 2nd Brigade occurring at Baylor's Farm. In one of them McMuray's company had several men killed and wounded. For the most part, however, Rebel fire was ineffective in the area of the 6th Regiment movements."
Just before sundown Smith ordered the long-awaited attack. His own division of white troops, immediately to the right of the colored division, moved off ﬁrst. Hinks' colored soldiers followed
