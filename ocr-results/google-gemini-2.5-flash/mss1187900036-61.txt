earnestly to be of some
use to you – You have
have helped in it would be
me – so it is. I can all
give you all the affection
and sympathy of which my
heart is capable. -
It is a queer way - I shall
go to Switzerland, but
only for a short time –
I think I shall be there
about five weeks - I must
be back in England, on
the 23rd of August – My
poor old Father will be
very lean after – to see me
return so soon – These people
for whom I have worked
very hard, during these
last six months – seem
to gr grudge me even these
few weeks of rest – They
wish me wish me to have
any affection! - Yet they would
very hear even six months
separation from their own children.
