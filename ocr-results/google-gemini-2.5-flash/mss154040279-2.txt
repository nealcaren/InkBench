My dear Mrs. Catt:

       Permit me to congratulate you sincerely upon the
award of the Pictorial Review prize. Few who have received
it have ever deserved it more and I am delighted that work
so important as yours has been recognized by this group.
It has been recognized by every one else I know, but we are
always proud when one more group notices it.

Very sincerely yours,

Frances Perkins
