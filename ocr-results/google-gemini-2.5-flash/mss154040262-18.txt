Excerpt from letter of Mrs. Catt
to Mrs. Maud Wood Park, in regard to
"THEN AND NOW". Dec. 8, 1944.

"When I was eighty, they gave me a birthday
party in New York and it was arranged that I
was to make the only speech. They suddenly
asked for it and it was not finished. When
they got it, it was with the intention of
having it printed, but I did not know that.
I sent them the manuscript and they had just
two days to get it printed. It was brought
into the room where we were lunching, before
I had finished speaking. Then Mrs. Slade made
an announcement about it and called it a
birthday cake which they had intended to have
but changed it for the printed pamphlet, which
they proceeded to give out to those attending
the luncheon. It never had occurred to me to
see how correct or incorrect it was and, only
the other day, in going through the shelf that
had the remaining copies on it, I sat down and
looked it over and found it full of the most
terrible mistakes anybody could have put in a
pamphlet! I was the more ashamed, for I had
given away a lot of them, which was virtually
assuming that I thought it was correct.
I have actually been blushing ever since.
And, if we, ourselves, make errors like that
in writing our own history, how can we expect
the coming world, not yet born, to ever know
the truth about it?

July 14th 1944.

My dear Mrs. Park;

After a three weeks
stay in the hospital and four weeks at
home, with a nurse in charge, Mrs. Catt
has today discharged the nurse and is
trying to get back to normal living.

She started out this afternoon to
dictating some letters, but I could see
that she had done enough. So I told
her I would write to a few of the
old friends and tell them that she
very much improved in health and that
she would love to have a letter from them.

She is now able to see people and
although we limit the number per day
and the length of visit, usually, she is
enjoying seeing her friends once more.

Mrs. Slade and Mabel Russell are to
come out tomorrow afternoon, Mary Peck
comes in very frequently and she is
just as much interested as ever in the
news of the day and the progress of the
warring world. We have set a date for
the closing of the European portion of
the war-game, but still keep our date a
dark secret.

CCC. sends love and good-wishes for
your health.

Very sincerely yours,

Alda Malon
for CCC.
