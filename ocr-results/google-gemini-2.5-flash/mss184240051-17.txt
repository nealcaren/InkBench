[* Small newspaper clip titled "The Light in the Tunnel" with text "A new device for the bewilderment of lovers was successfully used by a fearless young man on the Bay Ridge railroad yesterday. A damsel not to be trifled with, whose only wish was young and modest, and the young man, whose wishes were but one. One arm was thrown carelessly about the waist of the fair, and upon this the evil-minded person behind them had shut off the light. The affliction did not disturb performances of that sort, when the train burst forth from the blinding darkness of the tunnel, were behold by all and astonished and snickering occupants of the car. The crew enjoyed the scene, impressed by the demure and unconcerned appearance of the lovers and then the train bounded again into light." *]

She seems to have made up her mind what to do if he struck her, for when he did so, she drew a re-volver from her pocket and shot him dead." *]
