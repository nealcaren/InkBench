The Smith sisters of Glastonbury have
lately parted with a share of bank stock and
two of their pet Alderneys, rather than pay
their taxes in the regular way, in our pres-
ent depreciated currency. But the Worces-
ter Fosters, Stephen S. and Abby Kelly,
who have been refusing to pay their taxes
for several years, because Abby was not al-
lowed to vote, have clearly got sick of the
martyr business. And no wonder, for it
was rather expensive, and and the public has
been more disposed to poke fun at, than to
sympathize with, the "sufferers." The Wor-
cester authorities have treated the Foster
couple with great forbearance,-recogniz-
ing that, owing to rather muddled
ideas of the theory of taxation,
they really believed they were vindi-
cating a principle in refusing payment.
The fallacy of their idea, as THE UNION has
often shown, rests upon the entirely mis-
taken notion that taxation is connected with
the right of suffrage or anyway dependent
on it. The world was taxed six thousand
years before suffrage was invented, and the
citizens of countries where suffrage does not
exist are taxed to day without a thought of
protest. Minors are taxed, non-residents
are taxed, and universally, in the theory and
practice of civilized and uncivilized govern-
ments, taxation is recognized as the fair con-
tribution of the citizen to the expenses of
the government whose protection and con-
veniences he enjoys. Not to pay taxes is a
fraudulent evasion of a fair debt.
