I came to Boston in Nov. to
make a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone. I have been very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the elebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken, does
not break easily. I thought I should
see you here this Spring, because the Peepers
said so. It has been a trying winter,
but Spring & violets are near the door.
Agie writes me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work will do itself.
But if she is shut in, she so hates
in-door "duties" that she frets, she harnest
chafes. She has a good-practical man, to
keep her from doing unheard of things. Don't
care. Love bless you dear - always.
Lovingly - Mama Lucy.
