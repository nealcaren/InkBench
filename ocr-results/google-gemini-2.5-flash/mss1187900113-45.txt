was sought by
Mr. Frazer
the Director of Howe Institute
& questioned re annexed paper- to tell me he had
proof that "Philanthropic money" as he called it would
be found in the North (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for such rich reward as I have hinted
& to which he added the suggestion mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 4 Pages 1 & 2 of the
Chicago Tribune
Daily Interocean of 25 March, giving an account
of a successful colored Colonization at Tuskegee
also
Alabama- To which I refer you as more to interest
you.- It is a number of 62 pages printed at
commencement of copies as its 21st Anniversary & which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair 7. When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you freely to-
of my sketch.
ask your opinion, & counsel how best to proceed
I feel sure of your sympathy for the cause &
perhaps for and long since to remain, hopefully

& with very best wishes of the season for your
continued prosperity, very truly yours
