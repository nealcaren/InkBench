were on your knives! Nevertheless
Should you come, a fathers House -
a fathers 'home', a fathers 'welcome'
will be given you. You would
find me in very pleasant surroundings,
not quite such as I have on Cedar
Hill, yet very well adapted to
this Climate and Country.
Note what you say of young
Cook. I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
I feel and more sorry still to
know that he served Annie
such a mean trick. She
did a good deal for him. That
is perhaps, the trouble. Had she
done less than she would have
received more thanks. Gratitude
is not a very strong feature
feature of the Colored race.
