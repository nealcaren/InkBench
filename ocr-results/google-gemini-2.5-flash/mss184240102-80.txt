Friday Mar 8
My dear friend,
Yours from Ostunca
I sent to Mr. [illegible] because I
understood you were to
be there at just that time
but I could not have
met you. I was sick
for Mrs. L. I was very
much disappointed for
but so glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
I do take all care of my
self for that future to in
hopes. But this weather kills
me if it has one long summer
