TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double

By ELEANOR ROBERTS
There are so many guest shot "swaps" on television next season that viewers will think they're seeing double.

Searching back in your memory you'll be saying, "Now, WHERE did I see Bing Crosby - on the Bob Hope show or on his own special?"

SINATRA SWAPPING SHOTS WITH MARTIN
Frankie Sinatra is swapping guest shots with Dean Martin who, in turn, will return the courtesy on the Sinatra special. And Milton Berle is not only involved with Danny Thomas who'll make a return appearance on Uncle Millie's special but he's doing a swap with Lucy-Desi, too.

None of this involves the exact exchange of cold, hard cash which makes these top-bracketed, high-priced stars very happy since the tax boys can't take a slice off these reciprocal "visits," we hear.
All the network want big names because this is a season of stars. With more than 250 specials scheduled for the race for talent is terrific.
And the stars, fully aware of this, are holding back. Where once they would have signed

Welk, Gisele MacKenzie and Phil Harris will cavort with the Schnozzola, instead, on his Sept. 25 spec.

Whew, the mad dash for talent is really at its peak. Producer David Susskind is after ANTHONY QUINN to play the title role of Don Quixote in his upcoming Du Pont Show of the Month "The Man Who Was Don Quixote."
It's a free adaptation of the famous Don Quixote story that includes incidents from the life of Miguel de Cervantes, author of the novel. Susskind has his eye on Mexico's top comedy star, Cantinflas, to play Don Quixote's squire, Sancho Panza.

"BACHELOR FATHER" fans will see their hero in a TV role that, at last, Does justice to his dramatic ability. He'll play Sammy's (Larry Blyden's) discoverer

The JOHNNY STACCATO series (more jazz and more slinky private-eye stuff) may be changed to just "Staccato." Seems the opposing CBS-TV show is "Johnny Ringo" and would it be a pity if NBC viewers got the wrong Johnny?

DINAH SHORE

Speaking of the stars billing, Dean Martin is now clear into 1962!

DINAH SHORE'S new wardrobe should really be an eye-popper. She's been picking up glamorous gowns from famous couturiers in every country she has visited on her European tour.

Dinah stopped off with George Montgomery and daughter Melissa in Israel and bought a beautiful gown in Tel Aviv. Leon Uris' best-seller "Exodus" inspired her visit to Israel. She was a guest of the government.

Breathes there a comedian with soul so dead that he does not want to be a dramatic star? Apparently not, with so many of them - Ed Wynn, Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason, etc.â€”taking a whack at straight drama.

The newest one to join the circle is comedian GEORGE GOBEL who'll star in his first straight dramatic role on TV in General Electric Theatre's "They Like Me Fine", next season.

Gobel plays the role of a big time night club comic who gets his biggest laughs from members of his family. Very Pat. George's own alternate-weeks kicks off Sunday, Oct. 17 at 10-10:30.

MUST BE THE NEW HAIRDO or what gives with Hermione Gingold who looked so young on the video-taped "I've Got A Secret", Wednesday night? Positively years younger and quite attractive in a sleek, too-too sort of way.

She even looked glamorous on the JACK PAAR show when she helped him celebrate an anniversary with Dodie Goodman not long ago.

ANENT HIGH PRICE TAGS, the word is around that Ingrid Bergman will get $100,000 for "Turn of the Screw". . . And that, being given out on NBC-TV's expenditure for specials is staggering - $557,000,000.

Turns out that HARRY BELAFONTE who thought he'd make the "A

All-Star Football Tops Tonight

Tonight
By DICK KLEINER
BEST BET - Smack in the middle of August, we've got ourselves the first football game of the season tonight. The annual kick-off of the kick-off season, THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME from Chicago's Soldier Field. The cream of last season's graduating collegians meet champions, in this case the Baltimore Colts. As usual, it should be a passing contest, with the Colts' John Unitas and the All-Stars' Lee Grosscup (who'll play pro this year with the New York Giants) matching tosses. This is always a colorful game, with bands and half-time formalities and players passing out from the heat. 9:30 (Ch. 5).

7:30-8:30 (Ch. 7) - RAWHIDE retraces its steps back to the spot on the trail where everybody started dropping from poisoned food. Seems a pack of high IQ rustlers dosed the vittles with powdered coyote weed, a lethal seasoning. The object of their black game was to kill off the whole crew so they could swipe the cattle. They reckon

have an airtight alibi for the murder of the beautiful young thing - he was with Wynn when it happened.

9:30 - THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME (See Best Bet).

Saturday
BEST BET - The PERRY PRESENTS gimmick - the almanac - is gradually being eased out of the show. And, more and more, the singers simply do good songs without any attempt to tie them into events of the past. Tonight, Tony Bennett sings "Strike Up the Band" and Jaye P. Morgan does "Music, Maestro, Please" in that unconnected way. And there's a medley of some all-time record hits which has no almanac significance. During this spot, Tony will sing "Cry," Jaye P. does "Daddy." The Modernaires have "That's My Desire" and there'll be a dancing production number to "One O'Clock Jump." - 8-9 (Ch. 4).

7:30-8 (Ch. 5) - If your seismograph is registering some tremors on the West Coast, it's probably because THE DICK CLARK SHOW is getting ready to do three shows there. Before they left New York, they taped the one you'll see tonight. Jack Scott is the biggest name, with Tommy Edwards, Rusty York, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Browns the other guests.
8-9 PERRY PRESENTS (See best bet).
9:9:30 (Ch. 7)- BRENNER continues to find new approaches for a police show. Tonight's tells of a social worker and a policeman, who have differing attitudes about juvenile crime. Since Lee Grant is the social worker and Edward Binns is the policeman, both these views are believable and well-presented. Binns and Miss Grant, who have worked together before, make a good team.

10:30-11 (Ch. 5)-THE D.A.'s MAN is repeating one of its better jobs, in which you'll meet a real nasty type. This is

matter how diabolical he is. Both Conried and Bendix are cautious while working with young Teddy - he's the biggest scene thief in the whole county. 10-11 (Ch. 4).

6:30 (Ch. 2) - An excellent guided tour of the U.S. is provided by CHET HUNTLEY REPORTING, but there's a larger purpose. It's a suggested itinerary for Premier Khrushchev for his visit here and includes visits to wheat and corn fields in Iowa, a look at an intergrated community in Levittown, Pa., a thinking machine center in Cambridge, Mass., New York City, some Oklahoma oil wells, and thence to California for an illustration of how a desert was converted into a lush valley.

9:30 (Ch. 7)-The plot for tonight's PHIL SILVERS SHOW has an "Annie Get Your Gun" flavor. There's a sharp-shooting contest and, after one and another, Bilko stakes his lady wad on a WAC who falls in love - and you get a man with a gun. Cass has a ball as the dame.

7:00 (Ch. 7) - STRIPE SHOW, a Playhouse original which is repeating a detective story. It's a murder tale called "No" with Keenan Wynn the sleuth and Donald Cook the suspect. He seems to
