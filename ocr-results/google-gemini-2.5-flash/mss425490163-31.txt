Dear Mrs. Terrell:

Nor can I tell you how genuinely
delighted I was to receive your beautiful letter.
Yes, I knew that Oberlin was going to confer on you
a richly merited honorary degree and I was thrilled
for still another reason, namely, my daughter,
Florence, graduated from Oberlin three years ago and
naturally I have a sentimental attachment for this
great institution. Then, too, my very dear friend,
Henry J. Haskell, chief editorial writer and one of
the publishers of the Kansas City Star is a Trustee
of Oberlin as were his first wife, Isabel, and his
second wife, Katharine, sister of Orville Wright.
In front of the Art Museum in Oberlin there is a
beautiful memorial which Haskell established in
memory of Katharine.

I do hope the Judge's decision in
the case of the American Association of University
Women will be favorable and I will be so grateful
if you will inform me of the outcome.

My wife joins me in sending fond
regards to you. As ever

Cordially yours,

Jacob Billikopf

Mrs. Mary Church Terrell

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

July 15, 1948

May we ask you to take a moment or two to read the enclosed leaflet
which deals with one of our critical problems -- inequality of
educational opportunity for 10% of America's citizens.

It is not too much to say that upon the 32 colleges represented in the
United Negro College Fund rests the major responsibility for supplying
wise and capable leadership--ministers, doctors, lawyers, nurses,
teachers--from our 14,000,000 Negro citizens.

These are not wealthy colleges; their students come mainly from low-
income families. Tuition fees are necessarily low; endowments piti-
fully small, but their costs have increased just as yours and ours have.
So it is necessary to provide funds to bridge the gap between income and
operating expenses. The Fund was founded to meet that need, and for
five years now has successfully kept these colleges operating at
least at minimum efficiency.

This money is used to provide increased faculty for the largest enroll-
ment in the schools' history--31,000 students; for more books and
library services; scholarship aid to deserving students; class-room and
laboratory equipment, and other essentials. Without these things the
colleges cannot serve their students well; without the aid of the Fund,
these needs cannot be met.

A gift to the Fund does immediate good for many, in many places. It
will pay dividends in enriched individual lives and a more unified
America. It will bring you the satisfaction of offering a helping hand
to those who are striving eagerly to climb upward.

Will you join the more than 50,000 Americans who now make the United
Negro College Fund one of their regular philanthropies?
Sincerely yours,

J. L. Burling
