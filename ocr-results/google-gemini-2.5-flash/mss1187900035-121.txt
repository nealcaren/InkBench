I have had a most
advantageous situation
offered me- to live in Russia
at the head of the first family
of the court. - I refused, though
I accepted it. - I should
have concealed my
sympathy for the Poles
which work I made for
actually - I refused
it. - Though it was
again and again offered
before me - this very day
I received a Telegram
from Petersburg - urging
me to accept the situation.
I was glad to be able
to write to Countess _oloff.
that I was engaged in
an English family - I
should not have been
long before I should
have been sent to prison.
