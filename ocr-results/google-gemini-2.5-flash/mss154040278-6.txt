Jean fed us Alda attended the
League of W. Voters and Slodgetown
among them and alone Howard
might bought a blue dress and
received a caller.
I'm hoping the war will end
in the South East and that the Greeks
in their white petticoats will chase the
Nazis home where at least one
will commit suicide.
When we meet again I will
not be so clean as you are.
Like Mary Wollstonecraft you will
be "a shining woman"

Looking forward
