Dear Miss Blackwell,
We will be very glad indeed to have you on the committee
even though you can take no active part. Enough Jimmie Hig-
ginses turned up to do the work, & no reasonable person could
expect you to do the detailed work of the committee.
We will probably have a banquet as soon as we can get speakers
& a place together, as that seems to be the time honored me-
thod of raising money.
The National Committee informs me that a broadcasting
station with license can be bought for $50,000. But they
want to raise more, a total of $250,000; partly to get a more
powerful station, & partly to have an endowment to cover opera-
ting expenses in case the commercial users should attempt to
boycott us.

Fraternally,
Alfred Baker Lewis
Secy.
