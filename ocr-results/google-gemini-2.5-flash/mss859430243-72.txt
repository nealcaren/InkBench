PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION SONG
(Oh Promise Me)

Oh,
Promise me that you will never be so
Treas'nous as that Nixon pedigree, or
Sell the nation's Whitehouse tenancy as
Clemency for Nixon's felony.

Those,
Big crooks in Washington, D.C. do
Promise everything from A to Z, like
Reagan, lie us out of liberty, Oh,
Promise me. Oh, promise me.

Mike Zass

WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPECT

-- John and Deborah Landis
