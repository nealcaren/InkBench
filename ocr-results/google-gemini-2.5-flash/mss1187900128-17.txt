I know not where to find justice
for them! I appeal to your judgement,
I have ever been friendly to the
Colored Race, having lived many
years at Cape Haytian in the
Island of Hayti, where my husband,
had, a permanent Commercial House,
under the name of Wilson, Laroche,
& Co., We are well known to the present
President of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee for the House of Wilson, Laroche.
& Co., Mrs Wilson was also Consul
for the United States, and the,
recognition of Hayti was effected
by him. You will find his record
in the State Department.
Be so kind as to write for us to
influence public Opinion in the
favor of the Colored People. -
Begging you to excuse me, for
addressing you, I remain

Very Respectfully,
Frances L. Wilson
