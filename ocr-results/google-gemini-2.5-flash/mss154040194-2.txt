Dear Mrs. Chapman Catt

We have in our programme of this year to read lectures on "Famous Women." Mrs Reus Iamculescu and I will do it, she in the L. D. D. F. and I in popular evening course. But as there are no complete libraries in Roumania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books, necessary for preparation. We adress therefore to you as to the other sections of I. W. S. A. to ask your help.

Feeling so much the hips of a fem. library we shall try at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and perhaps than we'll be able to assemble round it the Women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time. Would your association be able for the generous act of [?] help with sisters and to send us one o the other standard work on women movements in your country and specially books, where we could find biographies of your famous women. We would speak in a first serie of lectures on political and social prominent women and in a second Draw the portraits of women in art and science." But we know so little, it is to say not [?]
