THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.
Some Iowa newspapers carry the
erroneous impression that the special
law enforcement agents are appoint-
ed by the attorney general. These
special officers are named by the
governor. If Iowa should elect a
"liberal" governor he probably would
have "liberal" special agents.-Sioux
City Tribune.

MR. IRISH GROWING OLD.
Nothing is sadder in this world
than the change that comes over so
many men as they shift from the
buoyant enthusiasms of youth to the
view-with-alarm despondency of age.
We do not know of an illustration
more to the point than the speeches
John P. Irish is now making in
Iowa against woman suffrage when
contrasted with the speeches he
made in the Iowa legislature for
woman suffrage.
John P. Irish was a forward look-
ing man in the old days when with
spontaneous eloquence he pleaded for
equal rights. Now he is as solemnly
alarmed as any other pessimist.
It is really too bad that so many
people begin to see every-
thing through a haze in the first line that he is "an Amer-
ican citizen," in the next eulogizes
England, and in the last subscribes
himself in lieu of his name, "A Glad-
stonian Liberal." Evidently he used
this expression to conceal his Ger-
man ancestry. What would we think
of the state of his hyphen had he
signed himself "A Follower of Bis-
marck?"
Third in the column is a letter
entitled "Mawkish America." Its
author declares that this country is
"hysterically feminine and neurotic,"
and he signs himself "Anglicus." His
hyphen is evidently severely in-
flamed.
Immediately following is the crit-
ical judgment of Mr. James McDon-
ald, who says: "I consider the Brit-
ish empire the freest and best gov-
ernment in the world." Well, why
not go home, then?

And the column winds up with
an article on the "mongrel popula-
tion" of the United States, ending:
"Bah! My country, 'tis of thee.

"James Macpherson,
"Trenton, N. J."
Just suppose that name had been
Wilhelm Lustenschrek!
All of these letters appeared in
one column of the New York Trib-
une, and they appeared there con-
secutively. Not one has been omit-
ted. Shall we continue to think of
the hyphen solely in Teutonic terms?

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.
The Register recently asked of the
Chicago Tribune "why did not Wash-
ington and Madison and Jefferson
and Hamilton and the constitution
makers meet the situation and give
this country an army and a navy at
the start?"
The Tribune comes back with the
claim that these men would have
given us a military establishment but
a blind congress would not listen to
them. The Tribune quotes a num-
ber of familiar passages from Wash-
ington, and then jumps to the con-
clusion that our school histories
ought to be rewritten to show the
military purposes of the fathers.
It is not worth while to quibble
with the Tribune, but it is worth
while to get at the real point of view
of the men who started this nation
out, in a military age, without a mil-
itary fitting, in the belief that a
great, peaceable, industrial democ-
racy could be built in this new land
free from the follies and blunders
that had wrecked every earlier at-
tempt at human organization.
The Register will not go to the
school histories, but will go to Alex-
ander Hamilton, because of all the
men who led in the framing of the
constitution none was more thorough-
ly conservative than Hamilton.
Washington Bureau of The Des
Moines Register. In an interview
Senator John F. Shafroth of Colorado
vigorously champions the cause of
woman suffrage, and specifically de-
fends woman suffrage in his own
state against charges recently made by
Mr. J. B. Maling of Denver that
suffrage had proved a failure and been
abandoned, says Senator Shafroth.

"My attention has been directed to
statements made by Mr. Maling and
published in Iowa papers, to the ef-
fect that woman suffrage in Colo-
rado was a failure and should be
abandoned," said Senator Shafroth.
"These statements are not substan-
tiated by the facts, and while I will
not dignify them by calling attention
to his specific indictments, I will
state that in my judgment the expe-
rience of twenty-three years of
suffrage in the state of Colorado has
conclusively demonstrated its suc-
cess, its expediency and its prac-
ticability from every point of view.

"Do women want equal suffrage?
Ask the women of Colorado. Submit
the question to those who have tried
it and scarcely a small minority can
be found to vote against it. Wher-
ever a law is disapproved by the peo-
ple, expression of that sentiment is
found in appeals for its repeal. Col-
orado has had equal suffrage for
twenty-three years, yet no petitions
for its repeal have ever been pre-
sented.
"The fact that a member of the
general assembly of Colorado has
ever even introduced a bill to re-
submit the question to the people
shows that there is no demand for
any change in the elective fran-
chise of that state.
"Furthermore, believe in an-

ish empire the freest and best gov-

A CHAPTER OF HISTORY.
The Register recently asked of the
Chicago Tribune "why did not Wash-
ington and Madison and Jefferson
and Hamilton and the constitution
makers meet the situation and give
this country an army and a navy at
the start?"
The Tribune comes back with the
claim that these men would have
given us a military establishment but
a blind congress would not listen to
them. The Tribune quotes a num-
ber of familiar passages from Wash-
ington, and then jumps to the con-
clusion that our school histories
ought to be rewritten to show the
military purposes of the fathers.
It is not worth while to quibble
with the Tribune, but it is worth
while to get at the real point of view
of the men who started this nation
out, in a military age, without a mil-
itary fitting, in the belief that a
great, peaceable, industrial democ-
racy could be built in this new land
free from the follies and blunders
that had wrecked every earlier at-
tempt at human organization.
The Register will not go to the
school histories, but will go to Alex-
ander Hamilton, because of all the
men who led in the framing of the
constitution none was more thorough-
ly conservative than Hamilton.
Hamilton believed in a strong cen-
tral government, and the constitu-
tion of which he was perhaps the
greatest advocate provided a less cen-
tralized government than he wished.
His belief in a strong army and
a navy was as strong as in a strong
centralized government. The fram-
ers of the constitution did not create the army which the
Tribune says was denied them by a
blind congress. The army was not
created simply because the framers of
the constitution believed that this
country would be safe for generations
without a strong centralized army,
and they made no provision even for
a small army except in time of war
or insurrection.
"Public safety may have no other
basis in government than the moral
virtues," said the men who founded
our government and who made the
constitution. "The people are too
intelligent and too honest not to see
the dangers of the large army."
The very idea of a standing army
was distasteful to the majority of the
constitutional convention and to the
people of that time. The constitution
for the purposes of the militia was
adopted for the proper establishment
of the militia. This will not only les-
sen the call for military establish-
ments, but if circumstances should
at any time oblige the government
to form an army of any magnitude,
that army can never be formidable to
the liberties of the people, while there
is a large body of citizens, little if
at all inferior to them in discipline
and the use of arms."
The constitution was accepted on
this presentation by Hamilton, but
the fathers were not wholly satisfied
in the private right to bear arms in
the American bill of rights, the
militia was officially recognized as
the military defense of the new na-
tion, and every man was protected
in the private right to bear arms in
order that at no later date might a
mistaken congress order or maintain
a regular army to overturn our popu-
lar liberties.
When the war of 1812 was im-
pending Randolph in an impassioned
speech in congress said, "I will for-
ever stand up for the militia. It is 
not in the scoffs of the epaulette gen-
try to degrade them in my eyes.
Who are they? Ourselves - the
country. Are them and you are
safe, beyond the possibility of dan-
ger. It is a fundamental principle
of free government that a legisla-
ture that would preserve its liberty
must avoid that canker, a chimering
army. Are we to forget as chimeri-
cal our notions of this institution
which we imbibed from our very cra-
dles, which are imprinted on our bill
of rights and constitutions, which
we avowed under the reign of John
Adams?"

And Madison in his message to
congress in that year, referring to a
refusal of some of the states to fur-
nish militiamen for the war showed
conclusively in what regard the
standing army was held when he
said that in a failure of the militia
"the public safety may have no other
resource than that large portion of the people that
may be armed"
This is what Hamilton, Madison
and the fathers believed. This is
what John P. Irish believed. This is
what a great majority of the people of
this country has believed from the
writing of the constitution until to-day.
Are we to believe the Tribune in
its belief that men of the future will
be different from their fathers?

"If Iowa should elect a liberal
governor he probably would have
'liberal' special agents." That state-
ment in The Sioux City Tribune in
the second column this morning
sounds like a threat.

ment in The Sioux City Tribune in

"Woman's presence in Colorado
has introduced an independent ele-
ment which compels nominations and
better officials. It has not been some-
how prevented from corruption or
wasting of money in elections." This
is a strong claim against a claim by the Tribune in
its issue of May 23. This is what
Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson and the
framers of the constitution believed.

"Woman's presence in Colorado

better officials. It has not been some-
how prevented from corruption or
wasting of money in elections." But
if it is a strong claim, the Tribune in
its issue of May 23, in reference to
the statement of this paper, states
that Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and
the framers of the constitution believed
that the people were too intelligent
and too honest not to see the dan-
gers of the large army."

They believed that the people were
too intelligent and too honest not to
see the dangers of the large army,"
said the men who founded our govern-
ment and who made the constitu-
tion. "The people are too intelligent
to be corrupted." This is a strong
claim against a claim by the Tribune
in its issue of May 23.

WHAT MR. IRISH SAID.
Legislative supplement, session of
1870, March 29, 1870: Mr. Irish –
It is to be expected that I, as the
member who introduced this resolu-
tion, out of which the joint resolu-
tion is moved, should say something
on the question before the house. Let
us view it, if you choose, in the light
of an experiment at whose inception
we stand today. Let us leave the
poetry of the proposition out of the
question, for the poetry of the propo-
sition has been given in its most elo-
quent manner by the gentleman from
Scott (Mr. Green). Let us view it
in the light of fact; look at it in its
prosiest shape and see if there is any
actual strength in the proposition.
Gentlemen who may object to the
passage of this joint resolution can-
not object thereto because it has not
been demanded by the class proposed
to be affected by it. The best and
the most talented women of our land
—those who during the late war
showed their love of country by
works which were not less laborious
than those performed by the soldier
in the field—women, representing
the most enlightened and highly edu-
cated of their sex, have organized a
When John P. Irish Favored Suffrage
In the legislative session of 1870 an
amendment proposing woman suf-
frage was passed by both houses of
the Iowa legislature, and passed the
house in the session of 1872. It was
defeated in the senate of 1872 and
so the amendment was not submitted
to popular vote. John P. Irish engi-
neered the amendment through the
house both in 1870 and 1872. John
A. Kasson was member from Polk
and he voted for the amendment at
both sessions.

This amendment was far-reaching
and read as follows:
Laws of Iowa, 1870; 252. Joint
Resolution No. 14. Joint resolution
proposing to amend the constitution
of the state of Iowa, and to provide
for its reference and publication.
Be it resolved by the general as-
sembly of the state of Iowa, That the
following amendments to the consti-
tution of the state of Iowa, be and
are hereby proposed:
1. Strike from section 1 of article
II of said constitution, the word
"male."
2. Strike from section 4 of article
III of said constitution, the word
"male."
[illegible] of said constitution, the word "male", and the
word "male" that appears in section
4 of article III of said constitution.
Further, if the amendment is agreed to
then it shall be submitted to the next
general assembly of Iowa. That the
amendment shall be published in all the
newspapers in each congressional district
and the general assembly shall vote on
the same.
This document was approved April 4, 1870

This is what Mr. Irish said in those years.
It should be compared to the present by
the present generation.

IN A SECOND SPEECH.
Mr. Irish – I am requested by the
gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Green)
to read certain parts of the holy
scripture. They are the Corinthians,
fourteenth chapter, thirty-fourth and
thirty-fifth verses; Epistle of Paul
to Timothy, eleventh and twelfth
verses. If I were competent to do
so before this legislature, I would
move an amendment to those pas-
sages. (Laughter.) But as that is
not competent, I would say, in ex-
planation, that Paul was then speak-
ing to the Corinthian women - I do
not know what sort they were. They
may have been utterly unqualified to
speak in public, and it might have
been proper that Paul should exhort
them to keep silence in churches. He
said nothing of the American women,
that they should keep silence at the
polls or legislature, Paul claimed
inspiration; but it is singular that
nowhere in the writing of his divine
master do you find such sentiments
expressed. Jesus, in the most sub-
lime of all his sayings, in his sermon
on the mount, exalted men and
women to deeds of charity, to be mer-
ciful, and humble that they may one
day walk with their God. This book
is in the hands of the people.
