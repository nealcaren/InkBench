Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 25, 1883.

Honorable
Fred. Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

I read your
speech delivered on the occasion
commemorative of Emancipa-
tion in the District of Columbia
and I was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterance,
and surprised at the vigor and
brilliancy of your powers after
an almost constant exercise
of them for nearly a half cen-
tury in the cause of your suppress=
ed people.
