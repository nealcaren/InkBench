Boston Decr 25th

My dear Miss Dickinson
Your favor of
the 19th. Containing a draft
for five Hundred Dollars -
came safely to hand;
and I should have
acknowledged its receipt
at once: had it not
found both Seaview
and myself too ill to
do even so little. We
are now better and
hope to entertain by
it all our guests - we shall
try. With many thanks
for your favor -
Seaview sends such
love to you & your Mother
Ever yours, truly
JM Barckett
