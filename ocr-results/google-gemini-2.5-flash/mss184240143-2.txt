My Dear Mr Dickinson -
I am afraid your business
affairs are again suffering.  You have
not the party called on list to carry
much weight. "Nice a man as inclined
but "Cant Keep a Hotel." I am sorry
I
think you ignored your "boss"
until John McCulough I might have
been more in a different position.
You told me you would see me about
your Theatreal business & the rest I hear
you have "a Boy" (as it turns) dabbling
with your affairs & "Muxing them Chilian
up."  I thought you had a clear experience
before with "Amateur Managers" & had
learned by experience the value of management.
Don't think I am scolding you only that
I
feel slighted.  I could do more for you than any
man in this business, or out of & for that
matter I would (or will) have done it cheerfully,
