War + Illegitimacy

ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%
"Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race", Berlin Councillor Declares.
Times. Dec. 12/1917
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 12, (Associated Press.) - Ten per cent. of the children born in Prussia in wartime are illegitimate, according to statements made in the Prussian House of Representatives in the debate on the vital statistics. The Berlin Town Councillor, Dr. Engel, in an article in Forwarts, makes the statement that this large proportion of illegitimate children is "evidence of the moral healthiness of the German race." He adds, in the course of an appeal for the withdrawal of all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children:
"Paradoxical though it may seem, this great number of illegitimate children represent a measure of the morality of our people. They afford evidence that, after all, the idea of the restriction of families an idea which the war with special emphasis bids us combat, has not yet penetrated the masses.

"The terrible fact, however, is that only 538 out of every 1,000 illegitimate children reach their nineteenth year, as compared with 512 in the case of legitimate children. The death rate of illegitimates is a convincing plea for the improvement of the situation of unmarried mothers and their children. There should be a uniform birth certificate, and women who were engaged to fallen soldiers should be awarded the title 'Frau'.
"Wartime, owing to the card system, is a torture for the unmarried mother. Every journey for a food card is a path of thorns and a source of fresh mortification and humiliation. In the card issuing offices and again in the shops, she must again and again make confession of her fault. The awarding to her of the title Frau would remove many obstacles and much mental torture."
The number of unmarried mothers in Prussia, Dr. Engel' states, has now reached a total of nearly 200,000 yearly.
