that all thoughtful
who have the good of African
race at heart will agree with
you in the soundly philosophic
and views you have taken of
the subject - will your address
be published in pamphlet
form? If so I shall order
some for circulation. this is
not a word or thought in it
that I would have changed
in any respect. Again I beg to
thank you for laying before the
American People so valuable
and timely an address. I wish
you would send a copy to
our common friend Cyrus
McKee, Hopedale Nassau Co
Ohio. He is of the old aboli

tion people, an times of Ohio of whom I feel
are interested and please put some
Mark on it by which he will know
from whom he receives it.
Do your
own come over in these Days?
Should you come to this city
remember you have a call on
Buskin, which if you follow it
will take you to my house
86 North Prospect St.
faithfully Yours
Robert B Folyre
