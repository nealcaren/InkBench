suffered with their unhappy and proscribed chattels. The white men of the North, who, from their own hard-earned and hoarded wages, will support their unemployed craftsman rather than let him work for under wages, would hardly have permitted men to work beside them for nothing, and throw their babies as property into the scale with their unrequited toil.

Sir, I believe this war was inevitable. The insane ambition and mad, craving lust of the South could be checked alone by the results of war. It had closed its ears hermetically against the voice of persuasion and reason. And wherever slavery existed that ambition and that lust had root. Slavery did cause this war. It was destined to cause war, and if not put in process of eradication, will involve our posterity in war. Is it not fitting, therefore, that the result of the war shall be the end of slavery? The President's proclamation does not propose to touch the institution in the Border States. But, as I have said, with the market for an annual crop gone, it will be found to be of no more value in Kentucky than it is now found to be in Missouri, with her free surroundings. And then we will come to what I am prepared to say very few words upon, the compensated emancipation proposition of the President.

The countless millions, the millions of millions that we have heard from the other side are to be expended in compensated emancipation, will be somewhat reduced when we come to remember that it is only the loyal men of the Border States that we will have to deal with.

Missouri is here, asking $10,000,000 on condition that she emancipates her slaves within a little more than a year. In God's name, let us give it to her; and if Kentucky and Maryland make the same claim, let us give it to them, and pay our full share out of the results of our own hard labor at the North. Let us even, by an addition to our already grievous burden of taxes imposed by this war — slavery's own offspring — share the losses of those whose slaves shall be exalted into freemen.

But, say the gentlemen, the proclamation is unconstitutional and illegal, and therefore void. I fear self-interest blinds some of them. It is a professional maxim that he has a fool for a client who takes charge of his own case. Certainly, no disinterested lawyer will dispute the validity of the proclamation of the commander-in-chief inviting to our flag people of the rebel States, and promising them protection and the enjoyment of constitutional rights. But will the proclamation be enforced?
