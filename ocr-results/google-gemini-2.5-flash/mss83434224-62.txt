the world. Composed at first of four, then three divisions,
STRAC is to a great extent self-contained and self-
sufficient. It made up part of STRAF (Strategic Army
Forces), which included the other U. S.-based divisions
that were in a lesser state of readiness. STRAC was
strengthened in airpower and airlift in 1961 when
it was combined with TAC (Tactical Air Command) to
make the USSTRICOM (U.S. Strike Command).

In the Cuban crisis of October 1962 STRAC demon-
strated its importance when units totaling more than
100,000 officers and men, assigned to USSTRICOM, were
deployed as an augmentation to the operational com-
mand of the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic. Additional
divisions also were alerted; 10,000 men became part of
the Peninsula Base Command in Florida; and Army air
defense battalions with their Hawk and Hercules mis-
siles were deployed there in support.

In the 1953-63 period the Department of Defense was
given new powers and responsibilities. As a result, the
Army has become—to an even greater degree—an ele-
ment in a unified military command structure. Recogni-
tion that strategic and tactical policy must be completely
unified emerged from the Department of Defense Re-
organization Act of 1958, which established direct com-
mand channels from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the
unified and specified commands for strategic military
planning and operations. This eliminated the military de-
partment as executive agency within the chain of com-
mand; however, the departments and services retained
responsibility for preparation, provision and support of
their respective forces in unified/specified commands.

The most thoroughly high-level Army reorganization
since the establishment of the General Staff in 1903
began in 1962. It was an answer to the increasingly
complex technical requirements of modern warfare, the
ever-increasing international threats, and the growing
importance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Depart-
ment of Defense. To be more responsive to requirements,
the General Staff was relieved of command-type func-
tions—training, procuring equipment, and the like—and
left free to concentrate on planning, programming, policy
making, and general supervision.

United States Continental Army Command (USCON-
ARC) was made responsible for virtually all individual
