Dear Mary, I received a book yesterday the 24th gift this spring! & this book will help to attain success with all tools when the author (would be) has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary to express the feeble thoughts she has, it will be most welcome. Until I have read it I shasl not know whether to return it or to keep it with thanks.
I am sending you a tiny box of left over seeds. This is no gift, just had them. I haven't the remotest idea what any of them are, but my will find out. If you were nearer I should have given you at garden full of plants from the greenhouse all of which will either die in my garden or give matured little blossoms. They would have been stalwart wonders in yours. When you come home, I shall take you to see a garden that is worth looking at.
