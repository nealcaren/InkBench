Washington, D. C., April 11" 1903
609-F.St. N.W.

Mr. S.P.Leighton,
Dear Sir:
Yours of the 6" inst. was
duly received, the contents of which was care-
fully noted by Mr. Lewis Douglass:
In reply, he desired me to say that he had
no disposition, whatever, to make any change
regarding a stone step on the premises referred
to in your letter.
On the contrary, he desires Mr. Helen
Douglass' attention called to the fact that
said premises is in immediate need of improvement
both in and out, the walls, the broken blinds, and
especially the sanitary apartments, make it
almost untenable. It is also badly in need of a
coat of paint, which, in its conspicuous position,
makes a most detestable appearance.
It is the only residence in that immediate
neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to
the Landlord -
Respectfully yours, Joseph Douglass
2595 Clerk.
