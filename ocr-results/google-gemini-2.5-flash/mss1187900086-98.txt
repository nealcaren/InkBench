Dear Fredrick Douglass

When we first saw your
appointment to Hayti - and also how
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you
I began to clip and stick them with
the intention of sending them all on
to you - I cut "lots" of them. But alas!
in the huge files of editorial scraps
they have all disappeared but three
I enclose.
It was pleasant to see the
appreciation in which you are held.
while you are alive to see it.
I am not sure but we are glad
to have you go - we need you
                   here.
