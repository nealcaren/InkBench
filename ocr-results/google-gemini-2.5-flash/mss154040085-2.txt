Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Chairman
Woman's Centennial Congress
120 Paine Avenue
New Rochelle, N.Y.

Dear Mrs. Catt:

I wish to express to you my appreciation of the commemorative
gift of a copy of the book "Victory-How Women Won It".

_
The photostats of the account of the Seneca Falls Convention
of 1848, as well as other reprints were found to be very in-
teresting. I was sorry not to receive a copy of the Tuesday
evening program containing the list of women in careers.

_
From all reports I hear about the Congress, I am sure it was
interesting and stimulating, as well as inspirational to everyone
present. Personally I am very much interested in vocations for
women, and am a member of the local Chicago Club of Altrusa
International. Our Club has made efforts to carry out the
international Altrusan program of giving vocational information
to young girls who are choosing vocations, as well as to assist
women who have found it necessary to make vocational adjustments
later in life.

You can see, therefore, I am sure that our entire club membership
was very much interested in following your program in the meetings
of your Congress, and were just as happy as I was to have been
selected as one of the representative women for your special
meeting.

Very truly yours,
Millie E. Kalsem
