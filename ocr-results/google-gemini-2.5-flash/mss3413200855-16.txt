I will give another fifty.
I have a feeling that I did not send my check to the Cambridge League for the National League. I am enclosing a check for 50.00, if I have already paid will you destroy this check. My old check books are in Cambridge so I cannot look it up.
I hope Mass. has been getting some rain, enough to keep down the forest fires but not been deluged as we have been,

it has rained almost incessantly since early May, from the first to nineteenth of June we had fifteen days of rain. Will probably be over by the middle of July and will phone to learn the amount of the fund.

Very cordially
Sara du Pont
