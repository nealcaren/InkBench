Newport. R.I. Monday [Aug?] 1889
My dear Mrs Don [Vale?]
I have just found
out the daring take the where
of last years Hampton Reg.
Glancing over it and mistakes
August me the Seat of the
impressions Eieminll-
To this it is quite hard to
transcribe and get all of the text.
The paper is incredibly thin so the writing on one side shows through to the other making it almost impossible to read. Additionally, there is writing in different directions, so the image must be turned on its side to be read.

I thought I would call
this paper to your
attention. What will
be said by your arros [?]
when this falls into their
hands; or rather into their
hand - will it cause
them untold wrath?
