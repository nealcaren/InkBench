joint note which I will endorse, and
secure its payment by a mortgage on form
Stock, implements & household furniture.
The stock consists of four or five horses, two
Â½ Alderney Milch cows, a farm Alderney
bull, 3 Hogs, family cow, farm
wagon &c: - the furniture full & in
good condition. Farming implements
all required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at private sale for
$1500= and in full view will be sold
soon after Spring Opens, as it is worth
considerable more money.
They would not allow one task this
farm $1500= but for this Absolute certainty
of their securing this offer: - no would
I do it at all, but for the emergency
of their situation & Should this place
be offered at Mortgage sale, it would
ruin the Sale privately, as you will
see at a glance.
Can you help them_ in this hour of their
most need? If you can twice so
inform me, I will have the necessary
papers executed & take them to you
and day you may name.
I feel, Mr Douglass, that
while on claim upon you is nothing
beyond your regard for their mother,
pleading is unnecessary. If you
Can do it, it will be deeply painful
for will be secure in relieveing them.
Please write me as early as possible
in inclosed envelope.
Respectfully
J. N. Sears
