ture was started in the Northwest an at-
tempt has been made to start a similar
co-operative delivery system in Cleve-
land, Ohio. Numerous other attempts
are being made to solve the problem of
distributors' spread. In Cincinnati, for
example, the farmers have formed a co-
operative association and are building a
large plant of their own to deliver milk
to the housewife's door. In other com-
munities farmers are also working out
short cuts to the consumer.

"Licensing"

Third Assembly be promptly taken, the
date for the regular meeting of the Ad-
visory Committee on Traffic in Women
and Children was advanced by several
weeks. And it was to this meeting that
our American representative, Miss Grace
Abbott of the Children's Bureau, went
as "unofficial observer."

The full report of the action of that
Committee has just now been given out.
This informs us that the fullest possible
consideration was given to the draft
convention which, after much discus-
sion, was finally adopted. In this dis-
cussion two other important points were
raised and were finally crystalized into
resolutions. One was a recommenda-
tion for a questionnaire to be sent to all
members of the League asking those
states that have a system of regulation
for a report on its working and results,
and those that have abolished it for a
full statement of the reasons that led
them to do so. The other urges the
use of women police in dealing with
prostitution.

But, says the report, particular im-
portance attaches to that resolution
which embodies the proposal made by
the "unofficial observer" from the
United States. This was that the Coun-
cil might, without delay, appoint ex-
perts to make, in collaboration with
the governments of the countries con-
cerned, a comprehensive study of the
conditions under which this traffic goes
on, the methods practiced and the main
centers between which it prevails. Again,
it is seen, the mighty weapon of pub-
licity is to be used. Light is to be
turned upon this darkest spot in our so-
cial organism. It is hardly credible
that, when the full facts are laid out
for the world's inspection, governments
and people will not be stirred to some
immediate positive action against this
hideous business.

When these resolutions of the Advis-
ory Committee have passed through the
necessary technical steps, they will be
referred to the various national legis-
latures for ratification. Adequate leg-
islation for their enforcement must then
be passed. And when that is done, as
Mrs. Dale, alternate from Australia,
said at the time of the discussion in the
Third Assembly, the greatest blow ever
dealt at the traffic will have been
struck.
Your Investments
BY ELEANOR KERR
Two policies issued by insurance
companies which are very popular
and which are more or less on the en-
dowment order mentioned in our last
article, are income bonds and retire-
ment annuities.

Many women—and men, too, of
course—who have no one dependent on
them and wish to provide themselves
with savings from which to receive an
income in the future, find the purchase
of income bonds one of the safest meth-
ods of assuring this. The purchaser
makes annual payments until a certain
age, after which date the insurance com-
pany pays her a fixed amount monthly
for the rest of her life. Should she
die before reaching this age, the in-
surance company usually agrees to re-
turn to the heirs the total amount of
deposits which have been made. And
even if the purchaser dies after having
reached the stipulated age and received
some of the income payments, but not
the aggregate equal to the entire amount
deposited as premiums, the difference
is usually returned to the heirs.

The cost of income bonds varies
greatly, according to the age at which
payment on them begins, and the age
at which the income is desired. A per-
son thirty years of age, who wishes to
receive ten dollars monthly beginning
at the age of sixty, would pay an an-
nual premium of about $34.14, and the
same amount for each additional ten
dollars of income desired. Should she
wish the income to begin at the age of
fifty the annual premium would be
about $82.36. Disregarding the fact
that no interest is paid until the end
of twenty or thirty years, the interest
received after that period amounts to a
little over 7 per cent. on the accumu-
lated deposits in the latter case, and
approximately 11½ per cent. in the
former case. The profit to the insur-
ance company, of course, lies in the
fact that interest on the money as it is
accumulated during the twenty or
thirty year periods is not paid out, but
goes into the company's treasury. From
a business man's point of view, this
makes the interest received on the
money in the form of income after the
age of fifty or sixty represent only
about one-half the interest rate indicated
above, as during this time the capital
has had a chance to increase 50 per cent.
to 100 per cent. The compensation for
that lower return lies in protection
against making a bad investment and
in the guarantee of systematic saving.

The retirement annuity bond operates
on the same principle and is practically
the same thing, though differently
named. The premium unit for women
is $105 a year. This would provide for
a woman of thirty a retirement annuity
of $13.50 a month for life beginning
at the age of fifty, and of $30.71 a
