WASHINGTON, D.C., Nov 6 , 1883

Dear Douglas.

I think the quotation
at the head of your article
a little bit off color. There
is an appeal to mercy
rather than to Justice -
I think the following form
the same play is better.
"You take my house when you
do take the prof
That doth sustain my house: you
take my life,
When you do take the means
whereby I live."
You will pardon
the suggestion. What do you
say?
