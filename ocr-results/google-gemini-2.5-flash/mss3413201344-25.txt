Suffrage in the Southern States

SUFFRAGE IN ARKANSAS
1914?

MOTTO AND POLICY OF THE 1880 LEAGUE.

"For the cause that needs assistance,
For the wrong that needs resistance,
For the future in the distance,
And the good that we may do."

---
By Mrs. O. F. Ellington,
President Arkansas Equality League.

In 1880 an "Equal Suffrage League" was formed. This As-
sociation worked faithfully during the pioneer days with very
few results, but they laid the foundation for those who were
to come later.
The origin of this first League was, to say the least, unusual
at the time, and found little favor in the minds of men and
women alike. Strange it might have seemed then to see
seven women march down Main Street to Markham Street,
west several blocks to the corner of Spring and Markham, to
the Laclede Hotel. This building was owned by Mrs. Clara
Cox McDiarmid, the first President of the Association and
then a woman of thirty years of age.
Two rooms of this hotel were dedicated to the use of the
Suffragists, and were used as such until the building passed
out of her hands.
Mrs. McDiarmid was a lawyer, and as such realized the in-
justice frequently meted out to women. Hoping to assist
them she advertised in the paper she would render legal serv-
ices to women free. Strange to say not one took advantage of
the offer. The idea was too "far fetched."
One of the original members is still living in Little Rock,
Ark.—Dr. Ida Joe Brooks. She is a practicing physician and
has been for twenty-five years. She tells me the prejudice
against women, in the professional world, has not yet been
overcome.
The first President served only a few years and was suc-
ceeded by Miss Kate Cunningham, a teacher in the public
