London Sunday May 6, 94.
Dear Mr. Douglass:

Your letter directed to Man-
chester has followed me allround
till it reached me here.  I am in-
deed glad to get it.  When I wrote to you
I had not seen your letter to Mr.
Aked; since seeing it I know
from what he and others said
that while they did not expect
"gusts" (may they pay you the same
compliment) I do, in knowing you
to be incapable of such a thing
still they would have been
better satisfied if you had
spoken more positively regarding
me and my work. Mr. Aked thought
that since the Society had failed
so miserably and I was thus left
to vouch for myself, you would
not hesitate to vouch for me.
We cannot go thro' the country
telling people about this person-
al quarrel and why I am un-
accompanied by the Persons
Who brought me over. As the
best know member of the Negro
race, a positive letter or voucher
