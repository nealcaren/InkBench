life and escape from bondage
for me to sell saying if I sold
them I should have one Volume
to keep for my reward. I think
I sold ten Volumes. They were
published by Joseph Barker
of Seds Yorkshire. I kept my
book untill 1857 and some
one stole it and never have
I seen one like it since.
The remembrance of all the
above notes prompts me to
solicit you and your wife to
a trial visit. I have been
searching for days to find out
your abiding home and failed
correctly to get it untill yesterday.
And now a line from you will
give me pleasure to say when,
where, and at what time you can
recieve a call from me on yourself
and wife (whom I have not met)
our homes are not far apart-Salem Ohi.
Do you Remember Benjamin Brown & wife
old anti slavery stock folks. They had an under
ground daughter she married John Demise.
My brothers daughter is married to her Son
at Salem Ohio. The Demings have an Exhibit
in Manufactory Hall. My husband has been
ill and have not yet got to the Fair. Saw
you through My glass on dedicating day in
October. Awaiting your early Answer with best
wishes I truly yours. Henrietta Harris
