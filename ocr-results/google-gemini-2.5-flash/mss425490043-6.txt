The luncheon takes place at 1 O'clock P.M.
and the length of time devoted to ad-

Please let me have a short sketch
which we may use for publication in
our newspapers relative to yourself

to have this by Thurs. a.m. of the coming

Mr. Harris and I shall be very much
pleased to have you as our guest
while in our city.
