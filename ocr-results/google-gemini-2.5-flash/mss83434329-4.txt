curse rather than a blessing. I would not, at once, entire-
ly emancipate him from the control of his master. But it
should not be, as now, an arbitrary, unqualified control.
For that control I would substitute the authority of Law,
which should be SUPREME. In saying this, sir, I do but
carry out a principle which has long been dear to me as an
Anti-mason. I have maintained, and still maintain, and
shall continue to maintain, as a cardinal principle in my
political creed, that, in opposition to all individual, and all
associated, self-constituted authority, THE LAWS should
be maintained in full and uncontrolled supremacy. There
is no being, entitled to the appellation of man, who should
not find shelter under the ægis of their broad and ample pro-
tection. In applying this principle to the case of the slave,
however, I would not confer upon him the same rights
which are possessed by his master; and, for the obvious
reason, that he is not fitted to enjoy them. But I would
place him under the supervision of Laws made for his
special benefit, and adapted to his new condition—laws
which should essentially qualify the control of the master
over him—laws which should protect him in all the rights
which he is fitted to enjoy, and prepare him for the enjoy-
ment of those to which it would be but a suicidal philan-
thropy immediately to admit him. Sir, we owe it to this
degraded race of men to prepare them for freedom; to com-
municate to them moral and religious and literary instruc-
tion; to restore and protect the domestic relations among
them; to teach them the duties which they owe to God,
and to us, and to one another; and to build upon the foun-
dation of a conscious responsibility to the government of
Heaven and the authority of righteous human laws, a so-
cial structure which it shall be our glory to rear, and their
highest earthly happiness to enjoy.
I admit, Mr. Speaker, while I thus repudiate the doctrine of
the immediate and unqualified abolition of slavery, I main-
tain the duty of immediately and absolutely abolishing the
slave trade within the limits of this District. And here I
come to a part of the subject which gentlemen do not choose
to approach, but manifestly desire to avoid. In this I com-

obvious than the danger of failing to do any
thing by a premature effort to accomplish an
object which in itself is beyond what can be
justly and reasonably expected.
I have said that the public sentiment at the
North is not what it seems. I admit, sir, it is
greatly excited, and has gained strength faster
than any sensible man who observed its rise, its
growth, its progress, or its apparent decline,
would have believed or predicted. I admit it is
strong enough within the limits of the District
of Columbia to effect its purpose. I admit, in
short, that the movement of abolition is so far
irresistible, and that if Congress will not meet
it as to its present form, it will eventually gain
the power which will force Congress to comply
with its requirements.
But it is an artificial excitement, a forced
growth, rather than a natural uprising of a na-
tion. It derives its nourishment from the fanati-
cal and mistaken zeal of its leaders. These
leaders, with a few others of the same stamp, by
circulating papers with abolition sentiments
through the mail, have excited the community
to what is deemed a just indignation. They
have used means so extraordinary as to make
them appear perfectly ridiculous. They have at-
tempted to arouse the passions of the North,
and in some instances it must be confessed their
efforts seem to have been crowned with unex-
ampled success.
A number of abolition petitions have been pre-

wed to the House of Representatives by citizens
of the United States. Many of these citizens are
themselves, in common with the whole world,
profoundly ignorant of the manner in which pri-
vate property is to be protected.
And what are the facts connected with this sub-
ject? It is generally believed that the slave trade
is actively carried on everywhere within the Dis-
trict, especially in cities where there are large
proportion of free blacks. This trade is carried
on in the same manner as property of any descrip-
tion, as it is in the other places of the United
States. These sales have no relation to the slave
trade with foreign countries. The price of slaves
is largely increased wherever the slave trade is
actively carried on.
The facts are that the slave trade is carried on in
the cities of Washington and Alexandria, and in
Georgetown, though there is no proof whatever
that it can only be done in those places. This
is simply a natural consequence of the system of
slavery as it exists here.
The number of slaves purchased and sold in the
District is small compared with the number of slaves
transported from Virginia or Maryland. The trade
is carried on in the same manner as the sale of any
other property, without concealment or without any
attempt to avoid publicity.
And as to the question whether this is an iniquit-
ous or unjust trade, it is enough to state that the
slave trade with foreign countries has long been sup-
pressed by law. But the question is whether the
sale of slaves from one place to another is in itself
an abominable traffic.
The fact that it is an abominable traffic is, in my
opinion, established by the laws which prohibit the
slave trade with foreign countries.
In my judgment, the great evil of the slave trade
is that it is carried on by persons who are not residents
of the District.
It is stated that the slave trade in the District had
its origin in the time when the United States formed
a temporary capital.
The system of slavery in the District cannot be
compared with the system of slavery as it exists in
the United States.
In the first place, it is observed, that the power of Con-

wives—the utter annihilation of the dear relations
of human life, and the reduction of the single relation
which properly bears the appellation of matrimony,
to "suffer death," and all other relations of marriage
that the same trade is carried on. It is further stated,
that the persons guilty of such an act are generally
hunted as outlaws, whom the human race are sup-
posed to be.
I think I may safely say a number of these citizens
are themselves among the most enlightened of our coun-
try. Many of them reside in the most enlightened sections
of the country.
I admit, Mr. Speaker, that there is reason to believe,
that the petitions are not mere expressions of sentiment,
but are indeed the result of deliberate and well-considered
opinions.
An honorable gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.
PIERCE) has said that the slaveholders are always
unwilling to submit to any further restrictions. I think
I may safely say that the gentleman is entirely mis-
taken on this point. I think I may safely say that it is
the general feeling of the South to remove all cause for
complaint.
Sir, there are very many of those who are opposed to
the passage of any law for the abolition of slavery. Many
of these are not unwilling to abolish it entirely if it can
be done consistently with the rights of the master.
The main object of the petitions now before Congress
is to obtain a law for the total abolition of slavery. The
petitioners are not willing to confine their efforts to the
abolition of the slave trade.
The number of petitions from New Hampshire is large:
and it is generally believed that the abolitionists sent a num-
ber of agents among the people to obtain these petitions.
It appears that the abolitionists have been holding numer-
ous meetings and conventions in the District of Columbia
since the formation of the United States capital here.
The facts are that the abolitionists sent a number of
agents from New England to organize these meetings.
The truth is that the agents who were sent out were mostly
from Massachusetts and New York. These agents have es-
tablished numerous branches of their societies throughout
the District.
It has been said that these petitions have been
brought to bear on Congress for political purposes. I
think I may safely say that this is not entirely the
case. These petitions are truly the expressions of the
sentiments, no doubt, of the individuals who have signed
them. I think I may safely say that this is the best
proof which can be exhibited to overthrow the whole
argument which is based upon the supposed fact that
these petitions represent the sentiments of the entire North.
I think I may safely say that the people of the North
are not fairly represented by the numbers who are now
petitioning Congress on this subject.
The number of petitions received from the North is
very large, considering the whole number of persons in
the cities from which these petitions are sent.
But what are the facts as to the truth of this
assertion? It is believed that the abolitionists have
been very active in New England. They have
held many public meetings, and it is understood
that the conventions held in New York and Phila-
delphia were called especially for the purpose of
obtaining petitions for Congress.
The truth is, gentlemen, that the abolitionists have
abstained from any interference with the affairs of the
District of Columbia. I think I may safely say
that the general sentiment of the District is in favor of
the present state of things.
Sir, gentlemen who observe the signs of the times
will not doubt, that in the opinion of the great mass
of the people, slavery is an abomination.

ning that the danger of failing to accomplish any
thing by a premature effort to accomplish all that
is desired, is far more obvious than the prospect of
failure through delay.
I prefer, however, to address myself to the arguments of
gentleman on the other side.
I have heard it said that the public sentiment at the North is
so excited, so thoroughly aroused, so deeply interested in this
subject, and so fully bent on the accomplishment of its purpose,
that it will not be satisfied short of the absolute and unqualified
abolition of slavery, and that any partial measure, however just
in itself, however salutary in its effects, however conducive to the
ultimate attainment of our object, will only serve to increase
the agitation, and eventually lead to a more violent out-
break.
And to support this position, reference is made to the
fact that the abolitionists, after having obtained the repeal
of the laws which permitted the importation of slaves into
the United States, did not stop there, but proceeded to
agitate for the total abolition of slavery.
This is the argument on which the gentleman relies.
But what are the facts? It is well known that the original
colonies, and subsequently the United States, abolished the
slave trade with foreign countries.
But the question is whether the agitation of abolitionists
commenced after the slave trade was suppressed, or whether
it commenced before.
It is stated that the abolitionists did not begin their
agitation for the total abolition of slavery until after
the slave trade was suppressed. This may be true, but it
is not the whole truth.
It is well known that the abolitionists, many years ago,
agitated for the total abolition of slavery. These agitations
were very violent. They did not succeed at that time.
But what is the cause of this failure? It is generally believed
that it was owing to the want of public sentiment.
Now, sir, the question is not whether the public opinion
at the North is in favor of the immediate abolition of slavery,
but whether it is in favor of any legislative measures for
the abolition of slavery.
I have said that the people of the North are disposed
to grant the prayer of those who ask for the immediate
abolition of slavery: for it is well known that even the
most enthusiastic of the abolitionists, those who have been
most zealous in their efforts, have never been willing to
go so far as to demand that Congress should immediately
abolish slavery.
I admit, Mr. Speaker, that the people of the North are
disposed to grant the prayer of those who ask for the
abolition of slavery, if it can be done consistently with the
rights of the master.
The people of the North have always believed that
slavery is a moral evil. It is not, however, believed
that it is a political evil.
The people of the North have long believed that
slavery is a social evil. It is not, however, believed
that it is an economic evil.
The people of the North have always believed that
slavery is a religious evil. It is not, however, believed
that it is a spiritual evil.
The people of the North have always believed that
slavery is, in principle, contrary to the genius of a free
government.
I admit, Mr. Speaker, that there are a very great
many of the people of the North who are opposed to
the institution of slavery, simply because they believe
it to be inconsistent with their religious principles.
And I admit, sir, that there are a very great many of
the people of the North who are opposed to the institution
of slavery, simply because they believe it to be inconsistent
with their moral principles.
But, sir, it is not the religious principle, nor the moral
principle, nor the social principle, nor the political principle,
which has given rise to the present agitation in the North.
The truth is, that the anti-slavery movement originated in
the South, where it was first attempted to suppress the slave
trade.
The people of the North have been induced to join
in this movement by the representations of those who have
been zealously engaged in the work of abolition.
But, sir, what is the cause of this interest in the North?
It is in a great measure to be attributed to the efforts of
those who have been active in the cause of abolition.
And what is the object of this movement in the North?
It is simply to effect the abolition of slavery in the District
of Columbia.

to prescribe specific regulations for the administration of
civil government. But he came to redeem men from sin—
to write the law of LOVE upon their hearts—to establish
principles and proclaim precepts, before whose searching
and all-pervading influence the time-honored systems of
injustice and oppression shall melt away.
Permit me now, Mr. Speaker, to examine, for a few mo-
ments, some of the objections which are urged against the
legislation of Congress on this subject.
We are told, in the first place, that this is a question
which concerns exclusively the people of this District; that
the petitioners have no interest in it, and have no more right
to ask Congress to abolish slavery here, than they have to
petition the Legislature of Virginia to abolish it within her
limits.
The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts has made,
and said, and said truly, that opposition to the will of the
people of the Republic. Every interest within the
scope of the legislation of Congress is their in-
terest. Every thing which concerns this Territory con-
cerns them: its police; the value and security of the public
property within its limits; and the safety of the Represen-
tative bodies annually assembled here. This is the growing
capital of a great Republic. What may be the absolute
or relative increase of its slave population, or how much it
may affect the future condition of this District, cannot easi-
ly be foreseen. That population amounted, in 1830, to
more than 6,000. The time may come when it will amount
to ten times that number. And is it of no importance to
our country whether its Capitol shall be surrounded by a
mass of hardy, independent freemen, ready to peril their
lives in defending it, as well as themselves, from the inva-
sion of a foreign Power or whether it shall be guarded by
60,000 slaves, who, instead of rallying in its defence, may
hail the invader as an angel of deliverance from their bond-
age? And is not this subject invested with additional in-
terest, when it is considered that the Congress of the United
States will be surrounded by such an amount of such a po-
pulation? Have the petitioners, then, as a part of the
American people, no interest in this question?
And then, too, there is the character of the country as it
may be affected by the institutions within the Territory
where the legislative power of that country is supreme. Is
slavery tolerated in this District? The petitioners feel
themselves, in some sense, responsible for it. Is merchan-
dise made of MEN, within sight of the Capitol in which their
Representatives are assembled, and on whose summit wave
the stripes and the stars of freedom? As Americans, they
keenly feel the reproach, and instinctively reach forth their
hands to wipe out the stain from the escutcheon of their
country.
But, in the second place, it is asserted that Congress has
no right to legislate on this subject; that, however great may
be the evil of slavery or the slave trade within this District,
it is an evil which must be borne, since authority to remedy
it is not to be found in the powers granted in the Con-
stitution.
And what are the powers of Congress touching this sub-
ject? Is it true that Congress is authorized to extend its
legislation to the high seas, even to the very coast of Afri-
ca, and to prohibit the traffic in slaves, under the penalty
of death, while it is powerless to reach the same evil in the
very heart of the Republic? If the grant of powers must
be so construed—if there is clearly no authority by which
the Government can act in this matter, then must we sub-
mit to the evil, and wait an amendment of the Constitution,
which shall make it consistent with itself, and save the
country from reproach.
But, sir, fortunately for the country, the Constitution.
through which we derive our powers, is not thus defective.
The power to legislate upon this subject is granted: and
that, not by remote implication, but in terms of obvious and
familiar import. The 8th section of the first article gives to
Congress authority "to exercise exclusive legislation, in all
cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles
square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the ac-
ceptance of Congress, become the seat of Government of the
United States."
In the first place, let it be observed, the power of Con-
