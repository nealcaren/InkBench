My dear daughter. - Miss
Mack came yesterday
and brought the boy and
visited with me awhile.
She said she had a nice
trip up and working at
home and clearing away
woods in the back, and
the like.
We were very glad
to talk with you Sunday
night. It helps Parks, feel
better. We are doing very
well at present. Brothers
and family are quite
well. He doesn't come so
often now, is still work-
ing out at Jackson, and
they are getting welfare
help.  I hope you are well
and won't overwork be-
fore you comes home.
Now that school is out I
suppose some of the child-
ren will be over to stay.
Much love from Mother.
