Captian instructions and some Crimson crepe paper
describing the bro varieties.  She did'nt get anything
by letter by Chin Carr.  Diestrict's definitely stated they
cared for the instructions at $3 per 100.  Just why
anyone in that office should'nt Runn crepe paper
is a mystery.  I should think they might think
the campaign considers mostly of paper designs.
The result is that Rochester did'nt get it headquarters
declined for May 2. and the Caplious
gathered for my conference cannot take the
decaulous home with them.  That is a long
way from efficiency.  Please see what is
the matter and who does'nt Runn crepe
paper.  I will scarcely believe her.
Surely,

See you Tuesday a.m.  I mean today,

an mailed.
