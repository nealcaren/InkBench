Nampa back on the farms were
talking in favor of federal milk
control in secondary markets. Dur-
ing recent months it has become
apparent that state control in mar-
kets where out-of-state milk is im-
ported in volume was not enough.
Despite the fact that efficient op-
eration of federal and state control
agencies, working in cooperation, is
likely to lessen somewhat the need
for producer associations, there
should be no worry lest the control
agencies would put the cooperatives
out of business. Control adminis-
trators have publicly stated that
farmer associations were essential
for the smooth operation of the
dairy industry.

It now appears that the revised
Boston milk marketing agreement,
being written under AAA auspices,
may never reach a final, acceptable
form. The various parties to the
writing of the agreement seem de-
termined that they shall not be
forced to concede an inch. In view
of the fact that Administrator Sam-
uel W. Tator has reminded New
England that the agreement is
purely voluntary and that he will
eventually tire in his efforts to se-
cure the agreement, such tactics are
foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow
Seven Germans were sentenced to
a radio tuned in on Moscow, two
of them having their sentences
lengthened to four years for the ad-
ditional offense of discussing poli-
tics while the broadcast was going
on.

To most people who have ever
happened to "pick up Moscow" this
will seem a high price to pay for
either the instruction or the enter-
tainment offered. But the same
would be true of broadcasts from
Berlin or Rome whenever these de-
sert Mozart and Verdi for the arid
wastes of propaganda.

Whether Russians are being sent
to Jail for tuning in on the fuehrer,
or the duce, has not been reported,
but it is hard to imagine any gov-
ernment being put in danger by the
dreary stuff that is being broad-
cast in prodigious quantities for
consumption abroad. It would save
all the dictators much trouble sim-
ply to let the broadcasts cancel out,
assuming, for example, that Rus-
sian broadcasts do no more damage
in Germany than German broad-
casts are doing in Russia.

To admit, by police action, that
this is not the case seems like a
tacit admission of inferiority in this
kind of warfare. If Dr. Goebbels
has not yet managed to bring the
radio armament of Germany up to
the Russian level of efficiency it is
time for a shakeup in the ministry
of propaganda.

American and French
Bombing Planes
The description of 24 French
bombing planes now being hurried
to completion near Paris and
claimed to be the biggest of their
type in the world, invites compari-
son with the United States army's
Boeing bomber recently destroyed
at Dayton, O. With a wing spread
of 108 feet the French planes ap-
parently justify, by a small mar-
gin, the claim as to size. But the
232-miles-an-hour average which
the Boeing plane maintained for
the nonstop flight from Seattle to
Dayton makes the French planes
seem laggards, 12 being designed
for a maximum of 180 miles and 12
for a maximum of 208 miles.

The apparent superiority of the
American plane is still greater in
view of the accepted understanding
that its Seattle-Dayton flight was
made with only three-quarters of
its full power and that its maxi-
mum with four 800 horse-power mo-
tors, intended eventually to be re-
Republicans are evidently going
harp on it from now on.

While one finds it difficult to fol-
low the reasoning of the New Ha-
ven ex-mayor that it is more a part
of a national conspiracy for Gov.
Cross to fail to mention the Roose-
velt administration than it would
have been for him to praise it, the
poetic English in which the gov-
ernor did his praising two years ago
does seem to lend some significance
to his failure to mention it now. In
1933, the governor, formerly dean
of the Yale graduate school and
veteran professor of English litera-
ture, found his soul stirred, when
speaking for New Haven's present
mayor, to this glowing passage:-

Over the horizon and the hills
the sun has appeared, the eternal
symbol of hope and life. We are
quickened by a stirring of new
faith and courage in a new deal.
The dawn of better and happier
days under the smiling, hopeful
leadership of President Roosevelt
hints the east with gold.

The fact that the shrewd old gen-
tleman who occupies the governor's
chair down in Hartford isn't say-
ing anything just now about "the
horizon" and "the hills" and the
"new deal" may perhaps be ex-
plained on other grounds than those
supplied by New Haven's Republican
ex-mayor. It may be, as some
shrewdly suggest, that the Demo-
cratic mayor of New Haven, having
made a good record, deserves reelec-
tion on that as the chief issue. It
may also be that the Democrats
who generally suffered in the Con-
necticut city and town elections not
long ago, have found that the new
deal isn't altogether their best talking
point in Connecticut. And it
may be that "Uncle Toby," as his
intimate admirers still call Gov.
Cross, having been quoted during
the summer as making occasional
remarks which indicated about the
same affection for the new deal and
its economics as has been shown by
ex-Gov. Ely, doesn't see the new deal
quite as he did in 1933 and just
doesn't want to talk about it any
way. Perhaps his silence can be
explained in all three ways.

An American mining engineer
who lately visited Eritrea says that
he found there "a boom such as
America experienced years ago in
mining frontiers in the West.” Why
not, with a big army using it as a
base? But a mining boom is based
on gold dug up from the ground, not
on wealth dug from the pockets of
harassed taxpayers back home.

Shortwave amateurs had a won-
derful time telling each other about
the earthquake. Ordinarily the
chats are limited to comparing notes
on the weather in different parts of
the country, and an exciting event
at midnight of which the sleep-
world has not yet been told keeps
the air full of chatter for hours.

It is suggested in a dispatch from
London that "suasion of business
men" may in time lead to demand for
a government to lay an embargo on
trade with Italy. If there is to be any
trade embargo, that is not a very in-
spiring kind of suasion in its half
heartedness.


IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION
To the Editor of The Republican:—
If the subject were not so tragic.
one might be amused at the futile
and almost frantic efforts and appeals
which are constantly being made in
the attempt to reduce the number of
automobile fatalities.

We continue to produce faster and
more powerful cars, knowing full well
that the greater the power and speed,
the more difficult are they to control
in an emergency. We deplore that
there are so many drivers whose men-
tal or moral balance is not up to the
standard required for the safe opera-
tion of these machines, yet we provide
the operator's licenses for nearly all who
apply.

And, as if this laxity did not allow
enough reckless morons on the highway
we make it as easy as possible
to procure the drug which can so im-
pair the judgment and skill of any
driver as to transform him or her
into a menace and a potential killer.
We even resort to extensive advertis-
ing to promote its more general use.

In short, we demand more safety,
more speed and more alcohol. This
combination is impossible and every-
one knows it. Yet we still go blindly
on trying to beat the immutable law
which decrees that as we sow we also
reap. Truly Shakespeare is right when
he makes one of his characters ex-
claim, “Lord, what fools these mortals
be!”

PATRIOTISM
To the Editor of The Republican:-
Flag waving and lip service to the
constitution are no proofs of real
patriotism. The American Legion and
the Veterans of Foreign Wars are
very fierce against a little boy who
has religious scruples about saluting
the flag, yet they are unpatriotically
demanding their bonus many years
before it is legally due, and at a time
when it is highly inconvenient to the
country to pay it.

This and That

Boycotts, if unofficial, arencluded among sanctions, but in cases they are fairly effective. like of the Hitler regime by Jews liberals outside of Germany has German business a formidable 
The Chinese boycott of Japanese goods was so wide-spread at its that Japan was forced to use extreme measures to coerce the Chinese authorities into suppressing the movement, and even now trade is hurt by the strong popular prejudice against Japanese wares.

For a spontaneous and unorganized boycott to be serious, however, emotional feeling has to be raised to a very high pitch. In general the fashion and the desire for a bargain count for much more. Why farmers should turn this way or that on international articles of merchandise is a complicated question which only the least experienced importer can guess at. Sometimes it is the cheapest goods in some particular line, or it happens to send all the payment for the good you want to buy, because they click with current tastes.

Some exponents of a variant economic interpretation of history would have us believe that the reputation enjoyed by the products of certain countries is wholly a matter of international prestige. The world must drink French wines not because the vintages of champagne, Burgundy and Bordeaux are superior, but as a political gesture. French generals won so many victories  "la grande nation." If the World war had ended otherwise, they say, the world would have decided that German wines were much superior, and if Italy no longer wants to be associated with French fascists hope, then the wines of Chianti, Orvieto, Capri and Ravello would soon be voted incomparable against the producers of California would not be able to do as well, just by doing their best to copy them.

Connoisseurs in wine may not like that sort of thing: but that sort of thing is very often found to be true.  The prestige of the Soviet Union does not stop at wine; rather, it makes much of the Soviet Union a national symbol; it means more if it means something for the country of origin: and is a matter of political taste.

The prestige of the German Mark is just for the sake of the country itself. The Italian Lire seems to have had a similar trajectory, in that it has had great success, which has now stopped in the face of what has been happening in the world. 


Soviet matches have improved, yes, by much, but not quite by such a degree as for them to be better than what is the best quality of matches produced elsewhere. In fact, if you don't use them, you will have more matches than you'd know what to do with, unless you have to buy a lot of them. 

That is what determines the economic impact of any given product, not just your personal preferences. The problem with those items that are sold is that they can't be resold in bulk for as much money, or even at all, as they are bought. The other problem is that those who buy things from others—even at low prices—will still have them in various amounts.
