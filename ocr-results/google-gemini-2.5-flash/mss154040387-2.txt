A speech made at a Mass Meeting in
Memorial Hall Cleveland, April 13, 1921.

schedules one on Politics

There is not an audience in this country nor in any other one
in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the
hearts of the people. There is not an audience before which
a speaker may allude to international peace that does not re-
spond. There is not anyone in all the world who is willing
to say that he wants another war. There is not anybody who does
not want peace, but how are we going to get it? That is the
practical question, and it is not only a question for us to de-
cide in our own country, in our own states and cities, before
we can act collectively with other nations, but it is for our-
selves individually to think our way through.

We don't settle that question when we have a million different
points of view, but wait for somebody to act.

Everybody at this time is extremely careful about being non-par-
tisan. I don't care a rap about being non-partisan. I am for
disarmament.

I was for a Democratic League of Nations. I am for a Republican
one or any other kind. I believe in taking action on questions
of this kind and not waiting too long. It does not matter what
party is in or who is President. Our country is not judged by
its parties. It is judged as a nation.

Today there isn't anybody in the world who knows what we are going
to do; nobody in any other nation and nobody in this nation knows
what we are going to do. But I ask you if there is anybody
anywhere at this moment with an earnest crusading spirit who is
campaigning to arouse America to lead in this matter. Oh, no!
We are as stolid and indifferent apparently, and as inactive as
though there was not before us the greatest question which was
ever presented to the nations of the world.

It is a curious kind of psychology that is upon our nation. We
have always been a nation in favor of arbitration. It was this
country, I believe, that signed the first treaty of that character.
We are leaders in it. We don't believe in war as a nation. We
are a peaceful people, and we are believers in the Ideal of the
voice of the people, settling questions and not force. Well, then,
we are the appointed ones to lead in this question.
