To St Francis Hotel
San Francisco
New York, November 17th, 1919.
Sent Nov 18
Dear Chief:-

The 18 signed checks have arrived O.K. I have my eye on the
mortgage falling due "on the old home". There are dramatic possibilities if we
only had a good villain in the background who gives you the alternative between
foreclosure and marriage, the while he walks down-stage and hisses "I'll break you
yet my proud beauty!" I shall of course keep you advised on this matter.

Miss Hay forwarded under date of November 15th a cable from Miss
Macmillan addressed to you:-

"Cable from London signed Macmillan quote Spanish invitation received
send your call to convention in the for December Jus. Also send im-
mediately draft circular letter appealing for funds for convention"

This I followed by a telegram of my own summarizing the returns on the vote as
below:-
"Six officers vote yes as no returns from Central Powers stop
England France Denmark Sweden vote yes. Stop Switzerland agrees
if majority affiliated societies favor Spain stop Holland strongly
objects on ground of limited attendance and passport difficulties
preventing some countries from sending delegates. Holland proposes
Congress more central neutral country followed by special meet-
ing in Madrid for all who can obtain passports. Am sending full
report foreign correspondence to San Francisco."

Several of the voting slips include comments as follows:-

Schlumberger as officer and president:-
"Yes very willingly in principle. There should be,
notwithstanding, a meeting before of the Board of
officers for which we have already voted."

Bergman- "I think this is the best proposal that has been made
so far. It appeals to me tremendously, although I am not
blind to the drawbacks, especially the increase in the
traveling expenses which will be felt very heavily by
people living in this part of the world."

Switzerland- "If the majority of the associations affiliated to the
Alliance pronounce for Spain we yield. But we would very much
prefer a meeting in Switzerland. Our country is incredibly
backward in the matter of woman suffrage, and we are precisely
at the psychological moment when a great effort should be made.
And as with us, it is the masculine electors and not parliaments,
who must recognize our rights, nothing would have so much weight
on public opinion as having a Congress."
