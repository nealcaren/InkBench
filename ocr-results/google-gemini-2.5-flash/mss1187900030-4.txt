department. but have not received an
answer yet. I sleep sound & tight. It has
been beautiful weather ever since you left
and I do not think we will have much
Snow but it will be keen and sharp.
Elizabeth is making preparations to lead
her lecture next-Monday night and leave
us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next-week.
I believe she has notâ€“made her of her ap-
pointments yet. but - I think Old Snow
will attend & it: [illegible]writing
a great deal of noise and confusion being
in the Schoolroom and the few who have
[illegible] brought their dinners are as full of glee
as possible. I hope you will have as com-
fortable a time as possible and that you
will not-return home sick. Old Blum
will have to keep out-of-sight for a little while
the Governor of Missouri has a reward of
$8,000 offered for his capture and he will
too has given himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love,
and enclosed you will find a note
from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie
will send a few lines.

Your affec. Daughter
