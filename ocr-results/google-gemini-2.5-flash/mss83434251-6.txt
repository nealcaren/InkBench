war; very few old men and in the ranks very few boys. Our fifers are many of them boys.
"We have some Negroes; but I look on them, in general, equally serviceable with other men for fatigue; and in action many of them have proved themselves brave.
"I would avoid all reflection, or any thing that may tend to give umbrage; but there is in this army from the southward a number called riflemen, who are as indifferent men as I ever served with. These privates are mutinous, and often deserting to the enemy; unwilling for duty of any kind; exceedingly vicious; and I think the army here would be as well without as with them. But to do justice to their officers, they are, some of them, likely men."—M. S. Letter, dated 24th October, 1775.
The following is an extract from the journal of a Hessian officer, dated October 23d, 1777 :
" From here to Springfield, there are few habitations which have not a Negro family dwelling in a small house near by. The Negroes are here as fruitful as other cattle. The young ones are well foddered, especially while they are still calves.

Washington, hath inclosed to this State a proposal made to him by Brigadier-General Varnum, to enlist into the two battalions, raising by this State, such slaves as should be willing to enter into the service; and whereas history affords us frequent precedents of the wisest, the freest, and bravest nations having liberated their slaves and enlisted them as soldiers to fight in defence of their country; and also whereas, the enemy, with a great force, have taken possession of the Capital and a great part of this State; and this State is obliged to raise a very considerable number of troops for its own immediate defence, whereby it is, in a manner, rendered impossible for this State to furnish recruits for the said two battalions without adopting the said measure so recommended:
"It is Voted and Resolved, That every able-bodied Negro, Mulatto, or
