Dear Journal Friends
There is to be a Suffrage festival here
Nov 14 and 15 and we are to have a
Woman's Journal booth - Can you send
us any decorations and a large Card
We have some "Newsie" Japes and I
have about 50 subscription blanks -
I've never done anything of this sort and
have little idea how to go about it-
But Dr. McNaughton who is getting up the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of erecting a booth for the
Suffragist and if she .Dr. Mac N. had to pay
the cost of erecting the booth she would be
it be used for the Journal the paper she
preferred to help- I promised to see to it
