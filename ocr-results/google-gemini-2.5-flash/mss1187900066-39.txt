Concord June 14 1885
My dear Friend:
I have sent
you some portions of
my book in a fragmentary
form, not looking on
sheets proofs, enough to
give you what I turned
like, just yet do shall
soon have advance sheets
of the whole 650 pages
and will send you an
early copy. Have you
received. As I get
back proofs from others
to whom I have sent
them, I will send you
more, I will close the end of
Chapter XIV including
Brisketts account of
his visit, at Brown University
