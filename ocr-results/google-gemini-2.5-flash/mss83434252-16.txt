year, President Lincoln was authorized to accept negroes for any service. About a month later, the Secretary of War, for the first time, authorized the raising of negro troops, by directing General Rufus Saxton to arm, uniform, equip and receive into the service of the United States such numbers of volunteers of African descent as he might deem expedient, not

In September, the Union victory at Antictam so strengthened the administration that the President at once issued his preliminary Emancipation, which was to go into effect January 1, 1863; and after that step all logical objection to using negroes as a military factor ceased.
On January 1, 1863 (now just fifty years ago), President Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation, and the project of making use of the negroes a soldiers was then considered more favorably; but not until the 22d of May following was the Bureau of Colored Troops established in the War Department. The tide then fully turned, the government itself undertook the work of recruiting and organizing the new military force.
