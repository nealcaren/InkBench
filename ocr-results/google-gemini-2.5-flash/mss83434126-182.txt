exhaustion & thirst; and portions of those Regiments nearest
the river, broke ranks rushed to it almost plunged in, and
after staking their thirst returned to their colors and re-
sumed the fight. But the resistance of the Federal troops
became weak. Human nature could endure no more.
A decisive victory seemed about to crown the efforts of all
the rebels, at this critical moment a delivery suddenly ap-
peared, Genl. McLellan signalled to the federal gun boats â€“
to open fire on the enemy; soon their ponderous shells
burst amongst them. Their ranks were battered to the
earth confusion quickly spread through their columns,
and they who a few moments before were confident of
victory, were themselves compelled to give away.
Genl. Hantzgtman determined to recover the fortunes of
the day, by making a desperate charge. The gunboats
were ordered to cease firing. This Veteran galloped
from column to column and cheered his men to the
attack. The enemy met them with firmness, but had
gradually to give way. Their lines soon broke, and
eventually fled fled from the field in confusion. The
rebels previously captured a large number of cannon, and
portions of the batteries of Randall, Groth, &c. The
goal of the Campaign was reached in safety, and
the soldiers of the Union, saved the honor of their
nation with the blood of its patriots.
