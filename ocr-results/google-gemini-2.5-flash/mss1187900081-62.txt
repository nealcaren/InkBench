The enclosed
clippings from the Kansas City Times
of the 23rd!! I enclose to you for
your verification, or denial.  Hundreds
of your Cola adherents, and friends
in this state, have read the enclosed
with much surprise and sorrow.
We have been induced to believe that
both New York, and Indianna
could be fully relied upon to
cast their electoral vote for our
Gallant Standard bearer, Harrison
and Morton. A reply, either
confirming or denying, the enclosed,
will greatly oblige

Yours &c
