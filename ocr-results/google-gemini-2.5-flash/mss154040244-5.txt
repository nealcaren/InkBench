few will tell her, about
the League's ground floor.
We are meeting tomorrow
to come to definite
conclusions about the
design, inscription, &c.
for the memorial tablet
in Washington on which
the National Honor Roll
names are to be placed.
The plan to have the
unveiling take place at
the time of our Council
meeting in Washington is good.
With gratitude - & my
love, believe me
always affectionately yours
Katherine Ludington
