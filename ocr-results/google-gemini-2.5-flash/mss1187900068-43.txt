My Dear Mr Douglass
I send you a
clipping from the Brooklyn
Eagle of the 6th inst- and
while not- beyond your
account
and would not have been
considered singular in the
columns of a Republican
paper, is especially comple
mentary when it comes from
a Red Hot â€“ Democrat
All things considered I think
you have every reason to
congratulate yourself on
206
