Bridport, Dorsetshire.
October 9'' - 1866
My dear Mr. Douglass,
On our return
from our three months' tour
through France, Italy & Switzerland,
we spent a few-days at
Woodcote, (Bristol) before reaching
Bridport- at the beginning of July
Your kind & welcome letter awaited
us. It is always a great pleasure
to receive one of your nice long
letters, & this one (dated May 5)
was as usual full of interest.
I trust you will have no more
such adventures as the one
you describe as having taken
place in Baltimore last Winter.
It was a mercy that you escaped
uninjured, but you will
not be so fortunate another
time, so it will be prudent as to
where & how you travel, and
remember how very valuable
