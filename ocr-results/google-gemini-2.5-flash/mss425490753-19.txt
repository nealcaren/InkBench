J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year),
Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and
Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), rally
to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked
beans go big with Cornelius - Barbara says
the hamburger bun is divine–Jimmy goes
hard for the soup and a big cut of that
spicy mince pie.

You are building a better Chicago–we are
building better Chicagoans.

CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1929.

RUTH MCCORMICK,
DENEEN SOUND
CAMPAIGN CRIES

Senator Attacks County
Administration.

BY PARKE BROWN.
Both United States Senator Deneen
and Representative Ruth Hanna Mc-
Cormick, who has announced her can-
dicy against him, manifested yes-
terday what was construed as a de-
sire to see the actual campaign start-
ed, although each has chosen the first
week in January for the opening of
real hostilities.

Senator Deneen addressed more than
100 of his followers—Chicago ward
committeemen, country town precint
committeemen, and officeholders—at a
luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It
was a close meeting, but later the
senator made public part of his
speech, a criticism of the condition
existing in the local governments.

Mrs. McCormick, just before leav-
ing for Washington on an afternoon
train, issued a statement charging
that a "propaganda factory" is cir-
culating false rumors that she is not
a bona fide candidate. She will not
only expects what she intends to remain in
the race, but also she expects to win
the nomination.

Deneen Raps County Rule.
"Since the election of 1928," read
Senator Deneen’s manuscript, "every
week has revealed in some measure
the character of the misfeasance, non-
feasance, or malfeasance by certain
public officials in this county.

"The people have been deceived,
hoodwinked, and in part have permit-
ted unworthy prejudice to influence
their votes. In part they have been
influenced by small favors to them-
against the law and the general good,
and in a degree by the cohesive pow-
er of public plunder.

"I say the people have permitted
unworthy motives to influence their votes 
by tolerating the breakdown of 
law and order and economical and 
efficient government in our local po-
litical administration.

"The economic laws have moved 
slowly but mightily against the con-
duct of public officials and the lethargy 
of the public itself.

Penalty of Bankruptcy.
"The bankruptcy in the character 
of public officials which has been ap-
proved or tolerated by our people is 
now followed by bankruptcy in al-
most every department of government.
The economic laws are as remorseless 
as the natural laws, and we will all 
soon pay the penalty of what we have 
approved or tolerated in our local gov-
ernment.

"We are to pay for it in high taxes; 
enormous interest on borrowed funds 
to conduct the government day by 
day; impaired police and fire protec-
tion and the lack of cleanliness in our 
city; in the public health, the poor and 
the sick must suffer, and the children 
and the youth of the city must be de-

in the past was theirs by mere right
of birth.

"Have I overstated conditions in
our community? Political conditions
brought about these results, but he
deferred penalties are personal and
affect our community as a whole.

"There will be no need to state
political conditions or create issues n
the coming primaries. Every one
knows the facts. The contest will ef-
late to the personality of the can-
dates, their ability and experience and
character. They will be judged by
their intelligence, initiative, energy,
and sense of public service. Our duty
is plain enough.

Senator Condemns Prejudice.
"In this great campaign let us em-

that I am going to withdraw from the
race for the United States senator
ship. The Republicans of the state
have been asked to believe that I
have made a deal whereby I will with-
draw from the present contest and
make the race two years hence.

"These and other false reports have
been spread over the state with such
persistent energy that they at least
do credit to the industry of the propa-
ganda factory that is sending them
out. It appears that in making these
predictions the wish has been father
to the thought.

She’s in Senate Race.
"I want to say emphatically now
that I am in the race for the Repub-
lican nomination for United States
senator and that I shall be in the race
every minute up to the closing of the
polls on April 8, 1930.

"I traveled 24,000 miles in the state
of Illinois in 1927 and 1928 in the cam-
paign for Congress and visited every
county in the state. I am going to
make an even more vigorous cam-
paign for the senate. I have estab-
lished state headquarters on the seven-
teenth floor of the London Guaranty
and Accident building, 360 North Mich-
gan avenue.

"I am returning to Washington to-
day to attend the sessions of the an-
nual rivers and harbors congress and
to continue my regular duties in the

noon to tackle the task of reorganiza-
tion made possibly by the withdrawals
of former Chairman Homer K. Galpin
and Robert E. Crowe, former state’s
attorney. The meeting probably will
be held in the Hotel La Salle at 3
o’clock.

Among the speakers at a testimoni-
al dinner to Judge Marcus Kavanaugh
at the Congress Hotel tonight are list-
ed Charles S. Whitman, former gov-
ernor of New York; the Rev. John
Cavanagh, president emeritus of Notre
Dame university; Brig. Gen. Milton J.
Foreman, James Hamilton Lewis and
Silas H. Hawn.

WIFE DIVORCES
MORSE IN RENO;
HE LOSES PLEA

Reno, Nev., Dec. 9. — [Special.] —
Jared Kirtland Morse of the chemistry
department, University of Chicago,
and former architect of New York,
today lost a divorce action he insti-
tuted a week ago when his wife, Elea-
nor Chapin Morse, was awarded the
decree

The decree was allowed Mrs. Morse
upon her deposition alleging that he
had deserted her during an illness.
Mrs. Morse was awarded $4,500 a year
alimony for herself and an adopted
child, 17 years of age, now in her
custody. They were married at Roch-
ester, N. Y., in July, 1910.

In his complaint Morse alleged his
wife had been a hindrance to his am-
bition to study scientific research, and
that when he joined the faculty of the
University of Chicago she came to
live with him, but constantly nagged
him. Mrs. Morse denied his allega-
tions.

GUNMEN HOLD UP HOTEL
Two armed men entered the Kenmore
hotel, 5323 Kenmore avenue, during a
strongbox and escaped with $50 and a strongbox
belonging to a guest. Miss Agnes Nalle.
