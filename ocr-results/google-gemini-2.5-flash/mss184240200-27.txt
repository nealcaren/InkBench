I know a bad speech when
I hear it !!! I won't take
his opinion when in absent,
surely I prefer mine when I
have the same chances to judge
as he -

I don't know what you
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter from my western
friend but I enclose a
copy -

Good bye
again
with heartiest
wishes for your health
especially if you think of
facing the rigor of a
New England Summer next
July -
