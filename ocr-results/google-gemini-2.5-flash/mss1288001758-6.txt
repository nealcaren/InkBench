Just this moment comes the
little boy with your letter.
Thank you dear - I
Sympathise with the poor
dear – I feel at Mr
Brossons decline. But all
things Work together for good
to as good Souls as I -- So
Mary dear never mind.
there must be Something good
for your Son Somewhere, Because
you deserve it. I am glad
the children are as good as
nice for, I hope they will
thrive So. I tell Mary I won't
to have brine on the butter.
Please look and see if there
is any – Love to Mother &
all – But Most to you.
