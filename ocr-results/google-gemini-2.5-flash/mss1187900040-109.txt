But it really seems that
I am never - never to have
what I wish for.
Everything seems against
me. I wonder if some 
of us are really destined
to suffer - Perhaps it is
the only means of
softening the heart. - and
of teaching us true
sympathy - If so - Oh
is it better to be afflicted
for it is terrible! to be
indifferent to the sorrows
of our fellow creatures.
To know by sad experience
what it is - to be surrounded
by those - Upon whom
fortune ever smiled -
How hard hearted they
are. - Their coldness is worse
to hear - than the sorrow which
breaks the heart. -
