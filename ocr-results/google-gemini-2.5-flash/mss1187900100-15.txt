Bailey Tenn. Nov. 9th 1881
Hon. Frederick Douglas
We have a secret movement foot here
to move three thousand families out
West. We are trying & making every
effort to get up the money. In the
name of God we call upon you to assist
us & get your friends to assist. Now
this wall comes directly from the
cabins of the poor oppressed down trodden
& outcast Southern negroes & if the
northern people refuse to help us we are
dead men without a hope, all we want
is to get away from our oppressors &
then we can educate our children.
We have sent out several letters to remote
friends & we ask you to do the same in
behalf of poor suffering humanity.

Truly Yours C.S. McCombs Sec.
