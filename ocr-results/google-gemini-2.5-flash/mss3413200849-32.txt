You may have already
seen. If so, just
destroy these. This one
printed below. struck me
as particularly lovely.
I wondered if
you knew
Dr. Lewi?
Have I told
you that since
May 1st we
have had
Elevator Service
only sparsely,
and that from
Monday next
to the end
of the Process
of tearing out the structure, of
old humanly
operated machines
and automatically
operated ones - what
ever: and all
the new ones are
to be installed,
no Service what ever?
A Letter for
a guest received yesterday informs us
that "the effect that the complete
shut down will have for more than
the minimum of two weeks is by
[?] estimated
to be "staggering" the
work. - its policy of
saving will be made through the special charter of a plane rather than the purchase of individual
fares. On this account there is no set fee for participation. The cost will largely depend upon each participant's individual needs and abilities.
MEMORIAL SET UP
TO DR. EMILY LEWI

Friends of the late Dr. Emily
Lewi presented a check for $14,000
yesterday to the trustees of the
New York Infirmary to start an
endowment fund in her memory.
Income will be used for the care of
ailing women physicians connected
with the infirmary and their chil-
dren.

The check was presented to Mrs.
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of
the board of trustees, by Dr.
Marion Manter, medical director of
the infirmary, at the end of a
meeting of the trustees in the
Fuller Building, 597 Madison Ave-
nue.

Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Lewi:
"She was one of the older doctors
who had the courage of their con-
victions and the consecration to
uphold the infirmary as a center
of training and service by women
doctors. Without her work and
that of her associates the infirmary
would long since have closed its
doors."

Dr. Lewi, who died two years
ago, was a pediatrician who prac-
ticed more than fifty years and
served as director of pediatrics at
the infirmary from 1930 to 1938.
She was known as an outstanding
teacher and diagnostician and was
one of the pioneers in endocri-
nology.

One room in the projected new
infirmary building will be known
as the Emily Lewi Memorial
Room, the trustees said, and the
endowment will support it.
