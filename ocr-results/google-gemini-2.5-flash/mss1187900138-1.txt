Hon. Fred. Douglass
Dear Sir.
Francis M. Addington of
Weymouth Mass. 86 Years of age sends the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration
"Father Abraham,s monument!"
This Monument would seem to Say
That Lincoln's dead, but tis not so.
In Vain the assassin's arm to slay;
In Vain his blood was made to flow.
In Vain the vile attempt to kill.
In all our hearts he's living still.
And while a drop of patriotic blood
Shall flow in any human frame.
Two'll thrill at memory of the good
The great and Noble Lincoln's name.
This Monument we raise to thee
Great Chief Whose Mandates made us free
Our grateful Thanks to Heaven ascend
For Thee, our true and Constant friend.
Also the following
"A drip to America Personified"
The world is gazing on thee.
Dispose thy robes with Care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy Golden hair.
"Over"
