My Dear Miss Dickinson:

Your valued note of the 6th
inst was duly received.
I have expressed your thanks
to Mr. Brown for the Indianapolis Journal
reference & to Mr. Bryon for the more
extended notice of your address i n our
Logansport Journal.
Mother, my brothers and all
send you sure in expressing our high
regard & consideration for you and
yours.
I was yesterday at Indianapolis where we had a monster demonstration. We hope some of your friends
will have to regret Indiana after Nov. 6.
I have noted the influence
& impression you have made where
you have been since leaving here
