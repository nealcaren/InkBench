My dear Mr Douglass:
I leave for the East on

to my calling on you & Mrs. Douglass that
I shall be unable to do so. Do make my
excuses to your just wife for me. I remember
her with so much pleasure in Paris. I hope
to return to Chicago later in the summer &
then I will not fail to see you both. In
the mean while believe me,

Very truly yours,
