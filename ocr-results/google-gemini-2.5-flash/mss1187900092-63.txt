My Dear Sir.
I saw by the "Ledger"
on my way I read your Speech, though I
heard you With pleasure delivered it. I
had more impressed with it as I read it.
Last night I read it to my father, he
was much pleased and united with me
in pronouncing it able. You have showed
delivery it throughout the country, it will
do great good. --
Yours truly,
C B Price
