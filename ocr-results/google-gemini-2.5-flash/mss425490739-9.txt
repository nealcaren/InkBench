IN THE LAND O' COTTON

President Warmly Received
in Georgia Today.

VISITED MOTHER'S HOME

ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROS-
WELL AND ATLANTA.

Many Tender Recollections of His
Early Childhood Awakened by
Visit to the Old Homestead.

ROSWELL, Ga., October 20. — President
Roosevelt today carried out his long-cher-
ished plan of visiting the home of his

N o. 16,461.

old homestead where his mother spent her
girlhood and which she left a happy bride.
That the visit was fraught with many ten-
der recollections was evident, and as his
carriage drove away from the old Bulloch
mansion, where his mother lived and mar-
ried, the President murmured to Mrs. Roo-
sevelt: "I can hardly bear to leave here."
The President reached Roswell at 7:30
o'clock this morning, and was joined here
by Senator and Mrs. [?] Clay, who were his
guests at breakfast. He then entered a car-
riage and was driven to the property of the
fine old homestead is now the property of
J. D. Wing, a lumber merchant of this sec-
tion, who lives in it with his sister, Mrs.
Wood, the postmaster of Roswell.
Here he was greeted by two old servants
who lived on the place during his mother's
young womanhood. One of these is "Aunt
Grace," who acted as maid for Miss Annie
Bulloch, who afterward became Mrs. Theo-
dore Roosevelt, and the other is William
Jackson, who decorated the mansion on the
occasion of the marriage of his mistress.
The President was deeply touched as he
shook the hands with Mrs. Roosevelt and in-
spected the house, calling to the attention
to the company many incidents connected
with his mother's childhood. Before leaving
the mansion he posed with Mrs. Roosevelt
for a picture which included "Aunt Grace"
and "Daddy William."

Address in the Town Park.
From the homestead the President was
driven to the town park, where a stand had
been erected, from which he delivered an ad-
dress. He was welcomed to Roswell by
Charles M. Reed, a student of Mercer Uni-
versity, who in the course of his welcoming
address said the only reason he could see
for the selection of himself to deliver this
welcome was because of the President's
well-known fondness for having young men.
Clay introduced the President, who was en-
thusiastically greeted as he arose to speak.
He said:
"Senator, and you, my friends, whom it
is hard for me not to feel as if you were
all my neighbors. It means to me to
come back to Roswell, to the home of my
mother and my mother's people, and to see
the spot which I already know so well
from what my mother and my aunts told
me, just as if I were really re-
visiting the scenes of my own life of
my own childhood. You have no idea of
how much it means to me to be intro-
duced by Senator Clay simply as I am
in what he said of me.
"Now it is not going to say nothing
and to guess about Senator
Clay, and these facts about this.

Clay and Cockrell
"If the average man I had to deal with
in public life possessed Senator Clay's firm
devotion to what he deemed right my task
would be so easy that it would not be
worth mentioning. I have gone to Senator
Clay for advice and counsel and help ever
since I have been in Washington, just as
I went to Senator Cockrell of Missouri
while he was in the Senate; and I have
tried to convince him that what I wanted
he wanted that way that I had to do was conscience
and not inclination and he always
did convince him that I was sincere.

"Oh, my friends, I can hardly bear to
leave here. Among those recollections I have
as a little child. It is like looking back
now at what one sees in a mirror, as if I
were a young girl and the Bulloch's family.
All these kinds of incidents, that are
part of my childhood, because they were
all tied into the home. It seemed like
a dream, but I was seeing it all again.
All about the Chattahoochee, about all
the Pratts and Kinseys and Dunwoodys
the other people that lived there too.
All these kinds of incidents that would
not interest you, but interested me a great
deal when I was a child. I wish I could
spend hours here to look all through and
see the different places about which I have
heard all kinds of incidents.
"All those anecdotes, I can see, taught
me perhaps all the more lessons I
not intended to teach us any other lessons;
we are very apt to resent it as
a child, to be told the exact moral of
a story. But if you have really lived
through the story, if you have picked up
the experience yourself, then it's all part
of your character and you always
have it with you.

"Looking back now at what one learns
of the home life, a real negligence of the
children, for they were little adults not
little boys or girls, but real adults. This
is something we are too apt to forget. We
are to blame for this, too, and not the
children and their parents. They did their
best. That is to say, they were a part
of the old South. They were not to blame.
But we are to blame for not acknowledging
it. This is a very important fact to re-
member. What kind of a story does all
this make? If we look, we will get the
real lesson, that is, when you are not
trying to teach a lesson, you are really
learning something.


everywhere along the line of the parade
from the terminal station to Piedmont
Park, where the Georgia State Fair Associ-
ation is holding its annual exhibition, dec-
orations were plentiful. The national colors
floated from every building along the way
from business houses to the homes of At-
lanta's citizen lining Peachtree street.
Pictures of the President were seen on
every side, many bearing mottoes of praise
and commendation to the city's distin-
guished guest.
The route of the parade was about three
miles long. The presidential train rolled
into the terminal station exactly on time,
and as it was sighted coming through the
yards every steam whistle in the city blew
a noisy welcome. Waiting on the station
platform were the reception committee,
headed by Governor Terrell, Senator S. A.
Clay, Congressman Livingston, Mayor
Woodward and Bishop C. K. Nelson. To
greet Mrs. Roosevelt was a small commit-
tee of ladies led by Mrs. Terrell, wife of
the governor, and Mrs. Clark Howell. Gov-
ernor Heyward of South Carolina, a guest
of the governor, was an honorary
member of the committee on reception.
As the train came to a stop Gov. Terrell
and Senator Clay, accompanied by Mrs. Ter-
rell and Mrs. Howell, entered the Presi-
dent's car to welcome the distinguished
guests. A moment later the party emerged
from the train. The original
plan to have the President pass the waiting
rooms of the station had been vetoed by the
secret service, and the party was taken to
the street level by a baggage elevator and
entered carriages back of the station.
Mrs. Roosevelt and her escort departed al-
most immediately for the governor's man-
sion, on Peachtree street, where they were
greeted by a reception committee of about
100 society ladies and witnessed the parade
from that point of vantage.
The line of march was quickly formed and
the President and his escort started for
Piedmont Park. The marching order was
as follows:

The Line of March.
Col. John T. Van Orsdale, 17th United
States Infantry, acting as marshal of the
day; platoon of mounted police; troop of the
12th Cavalry from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.,
commanded by Maj. H. G. Sickel; Presi-
dent's carriage, containing, beside himself,
Secretary Loeb, Gov. Joseph M. Terrell and
Maj. James G. Woodward; carriage contain-
ing members of the President's party; troop
of the 17th Infantry, U. S. A., from Fort Mc-
Pherson, Ga., and staff.
Seventeenth Infantry Band, 5th Regiment
Georgia state militia and band, Firemen's
Drum and Bugle Corps of Atlanta, provi-
sional regiment consisting of cadets from
the Georgia Military Academy, Gordon In-
stitute and Marist College, Governor’s
Horse Guards and other military organiza-
tions.
The route of the parade was Mitchell
street to Whitehall street, to Peachtree,
to 14th, to Piedmont Park.

At the Fair Grounds.
The President arrived at Piedmont Park
at 11:10 o'clock. The steam whistles of the
state fair blew an enthusiastic welcome
and the thousands assembled shouted them-
selves hoarse as the President entered the
grounds. A review of the military es-
cort was held, headed by the 17th Infan-
try, which returned a few weeks ago from
the Philippines.
From a stand erected facing the grand
stand of the race course the Dudley Hughes,
president of the fair association, at whose
invitation the President was present, in-
troduced Gov. Terrell, who in turn pre-
sented the President and he was followed by Senator
Clay, who introduced the President.
Gov. Terrell's allusions to the President's
efforts for international peace were re-
ceived with rousing cheers. Mayor Wood-
ward presented the President with a block
of Georgia marble, a memento from Geor-
gia's organized labor, prepared by Union la-
bor.
As the President arose to speak he was
greeted by the immense throng rising and
cheering.
(The full text of the President's speech
will be found in another column of The
Star today.)
