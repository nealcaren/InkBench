Dear Miss Blackwell,-

I am blessed with a
propensity: to be always at something. You
are something; still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three successive
spitters might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do.
The truth is, its hot; hot beyond
creed, to say nothing of deed. What resource else
was left but you? The other evening so + so was
spoken of to me as having done this and that
as nurse in the war. I was called on to admire
her. I had to say, yes, I admire what she did.
But must she not be a noble woman to do
so much. Then I said it's vary well for we
you and she & me, to do some good. It's the
only recommendation we can have; But really
I look to see one who needs neither deed nor creed to
recommend him. seeing what one thinks
not how much he has done and can do, but how
much he is.
I perceive I was talking Greek,
and went no further; but you who understand
Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
