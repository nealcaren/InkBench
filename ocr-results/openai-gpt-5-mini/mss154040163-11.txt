My dear Steady: I have to thank you for two
letters and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs. Blinn. I thank you especially for the clip-
pings for as you suspect I am interested
in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention, I think Mrs Sweet brought
a letter she had received from Effie Vance,
and she had described very vividly how
Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her
sufferings thro' Christian Science. Sweetie's
tears flowed as she read it, and she was no
great admirer of Mrs. B. I believe she told
me that E. Vance was also getting interest-
ed in Ch. Sci. Mrs. B. was one of the most
generous and forgiving natures I ever
met, and altho she also had her weaknesses
of character, as much so as the rest of us, she was
a woman to be admired for very many
estimable qualities.
