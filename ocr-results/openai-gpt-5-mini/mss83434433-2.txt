Dear Sir

I have thought of an expedient to bring
in Caroline which I submit to you. It is this, Genl
Moseley is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi.
Now if you could disperse with James & see Genl Mc
& let her go & slay his negro's & get it out that he has bought
her - it would I am sure bring her in - Let it be out
that it is an arrangement of mine over which you have
no control: What do you think of it? Let me know

Yr truly
John H. Sew
