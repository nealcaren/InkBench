Friday Mar 8

My dear friend.

I went to Wâ€” because I
understood you were to
be there at just that time
but I couldn't have
met you. I was sick
For was Mrs L. I was very
much "disappointed" too
but so glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
I did take all care of my
self for that future to in
hope. But this weather kills
me if it was one long summer
