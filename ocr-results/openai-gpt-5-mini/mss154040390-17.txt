with the policies of our own government. The only communists who
ever made any trouble with Mexico went there from the United
States and were sent back by the Mexican government.

The agrarian revolution in Mexico began in 1910, seven
years before the Russian revolution. Professor Hackett, of the
University of Texas, an able and disinterested student of Mexi-
can affairs, has declared: "At the outset it may be said that
the Mexican revolution, which began in 1910, was as inevitable
as was the French revolution, and as the causes for that more
celebrated European struggle lay in the history of France as a
divine right monarchy, so the causes of the Mexican revolution
of 1910 are to be found in the history of the so-called thirty-
five years Presidential reign of Porfirio Diaz." I believe the
facts justify fully and completely the causes of the agrarian
revolution in Mexico just as Professor Hackett has stated it.

Let us look these facts in the face. They ought to
silence the lips of those who would have the American people
believe that Mexico has simply gone mad over communism. When
Diaz became President of Mexico in 1876, Mexico already had her
share of large estates, great ranches, haciendas. During the
reign of Diaz, he disposed of some 134,600,000 acres of land,
some of it was disposed of legally and some otherwise. Some of
it was sold to parties and some of it was given to political
retainers and supporters. This acreage thus disposed of was
about three times the size of all New England. The average cit-
izen received no part of it - in fact, the small holders were
dispossessed and their property confiscated in order to enable
the large holders to gather their acreage.

From time immemorial the Mexican villages have owned
their communal lands, their ejidos, averaging in area from
4,390 acres to 17,360 acres. These communal lands were used by
the villagers for raising food and pasturing their animals.
These communal holdings were all that stood between the vil-
lagers and peonage. These lands under Spanish and Mexican law
could not be alienated. But Diaz broke up and destroyed over
90% of the communal holdings - a cruel, ruthless, brutal ex-
ploitation of the poor people of Mexico. When these communal
holdings were destroyed, 3,103,402 Mexicans passed into a state
of peonage, they became serfs, working upon the lands to pay a
debt that could never be extinguished.

In 1910, at the close of Diaz' administration, there
were 834 hacendados holding haciendas ranging in size from 22,000
to six million acres. In the state of Morelos alone 20 hacien-
dados owned and controlled the entire state, while 180,000
Mexicans in that state alone were landless. It is asserted as a
fact that at the close of Diaz' administration 95% of the heads
of the rural families were without land and without means of
acquiring land. So we have as the result of his administration
