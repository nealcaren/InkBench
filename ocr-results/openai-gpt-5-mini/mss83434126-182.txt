exhaustion & thirst, and portions of those Regiments nearest
the river, broke ranks, rushed to its shores, plunged in, and
after slaking their thirst returned to their Cols and re-
sumed the fight.  But the resistance of the federal troops
became weak, human nature could endure no more,
A decisive victory seemed about to crown the efforts of
the rebels, at this critical moment a delivery suddenly ap-
peared, Genl McClellan signalled to the Federal gunboats
to open fire on the enemy; some their ponderous shells
burst amongst them, whole ranks were battered to the
earth, confusion quickly spread through their columns,
and they who a few moments before were confident of
victory, were themselves compelled to give way.
Genl Heintzelman determined to recover the fortunes of
the day, by making a desperate charge.  The gunboats
were ordered to cease firing.  This veteran [moved?] from
column to column and cheered his men to the
attack, the enemy met them with firmness, but had
gradually to give way; their lines soon broke, and
eventually fled glad from the field in confusion.  The
rebels previously captured a large number of Cannon, big
portions of the batteries of [Vaudale?], [Mott?], [Hyre?].  The
goal of the Campaign was reached in safety; and
the soldiers of the Union saved the honor of the
nation with the blood of its patriots.
