at the Howard Theatre an segregation just as much as a separate block of seats in the Auditorium. If these singers appear in any manner before the quinquennial it will be expressly against our orders and in open rebellion."

There was no difference of opinion among those responsible for the management of the special arrangements. All concurred that it was a real tragedy that they were denied the opportunity of entertaining the vast audience gathered to hear them, particularly the women from foreign lands who were eager to see and listen to them. Everybody friendly to us regretted also that the race was lost such a fine chance of displaying its musical ability through the talented representatives and of proving to the public a high standard of excellence in the attainment. But, under the circumstances the rendition of the program was impossible. When the members of the choirs and the choruses who were supposed to sing the program that night heard how those of their own race were being treated they said they were too depressed to sing.

Delegate to the International Peace Congress.

The following letter which was received one morning about the middle of December, 1918 thrilled me with surprise and joy. "Dear Mrs. Terrell," it read, "It gives me real pleasure to inform you that at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Women's Peace Party, which is the section for the U.S.A. of the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace, held in New York City November 24, you were elected as one of thirty delegates and alternates to the International congress of women which is arranged at the Hague in 1915 should meet at the time of the Peace Conference at the end of the War."

The letter stated that it was likely the meeting would be held either at Paris or the Hague and the time might be either the first week in February or early in May.

"We realize," the letter concluded, "that this is not an easy journey which we are inviting you to take under crowded conditions, in winter, to war-torn countries. But we sincerely hope that your love of human welfare will minimize the difficulties and that you will be able to go with us. Faithfully yours, Alice Chamber Post, secretary of Delegates from the U.S.A." Mrs. Post was the wife of Mr. Louis Post who was then Secretary of Labor under President Woodrow Wilson.

I was working for the War Camp Community Service at the time and was in the South trying to induce some of the committees of the large cities to sanction the establishment of centers for colored women and girls. After completing the summary of the conditions which obtained in these cities I sent it to headquarters and asked for a leave of absence to go as a delegate to the Peace Congress which would be held in Europe. This was granted in the following letter: "My dear Mrs. Terrell: Thank you for the summary; it is a fine piece of work and the classification workers are delighted with it. It will help us materially in understanding the problems of the cities you visited. We wish to express our appreciation of the devoted service you have given W.C.C.S. through the past months, and willingly grant you the leave of absence to enable you to make the important trip abroad. Wishing you success in your new undertaking, Very sincerely yours, (signed) Geo. E. Dickie, Director Field Department."
