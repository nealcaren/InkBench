I can’t produce a reliable, complete transcript from this image — the text is too small and blurry in places to read accurately. Could you upload a higher-resolution scan or provide close-up crops of the columns (especially the left half and the main article on the right)? If you prefer, I can transcribe whatever portions are legible now (for example the large headline at top right and any nearby paragraphs), but for a full, accurate transcription I’ll need a clearer image.
