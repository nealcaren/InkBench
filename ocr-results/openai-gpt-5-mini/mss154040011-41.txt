over births and sorrowing over funerals. As he has already
wept over the coffins of 100 children and we know not how many
grandchildren, he at least is experienced in affliction.

We stoped at a nice curio shop, the best of the kind
I've found in Java, and I bought some photos and postals of
Javenese. See postals No. 26 to 31, and photos large, No.
31,32 & 33, small No. 34Â½ to 48. After lunch we rested and I
read up about some more temples we are to see to-morrow. At
5:30 we were rigged up in our best and in a grand "milord" as the
big carriages are called and going to see the Prince, for the
Sultan has a sort of guard called a Prince, not so high as the
Sultan, but a royalty. We had a letter to him from Mr. Laboton
of Buitenzorg. He is a little interested in Theosophy. He
lives in a fine palace with an immense marble floored verandah
where we were received by the Prince, his Uncle, four brothers
and four sisters. He is a young man and is the "boss" of his
house. He is liberal, but he would not promise that his sisters
could go to the meetings to-morrow. The conversation was in
Dutch so I could only watch symptoms. We were served with tea
and cakes and later with lemonade. The refreshments were brought
by nine servants who knelt as soon as they came near, and who
hunched about in a way no white man could do if his life de-
pended on it. No servant approaches his master save on his
knees, or rather in squatting position. It was laughable in
one sense and tragic in another to see nine men with waiters
in their hands, crawling along like toads. These Javenese do
the same in the house of the Resident. The little Princesses
were sweet and pretty and bright.

(sort of theatre which consists of pantomime done to the
recital of the old Mahabarata or Ramayana of the Hindoos.
When pantomime is acted by men it is Wajang Orang, see
postal 41. When the people put on masks for the part it
is Wajang Wong, see postal 42. It is also done with
dolls, in which case they use them as shadows, manipulating
them behind a curtain.

I must return to the Sultan's Palace to record that under a
small shed was a nice grandfather clock, and above a neighboring
shed was a large bell, its rope leading into the small shed.
Two men were watching day and night by the side of the clock, and
every hour they rang the bell. Thus the centuries old custom
of ringing the bell is continued, but it is done with scientific
accuracy.

The most astute thing I have heard of in connection with
Colonial affairs was done by the Dutch here, nor is it a bit
more unprincipled than a thousand other instances of the way the
Europeans got the upper hand in Asiatic countries. There was here
a somewhat powerful kingdom - the real heart of Java was here.
The kingdom is supposed to have been founded by the Hindus, so
long ago no one can name the date, and was called Mataram, which
means Mother. A Sultan presided over it and the Dutch, loaded
down as they were with other wars could not attack it. At
length the Chinese in the kingdom revolted and the Sultan called
in the Dutch to help, which of course they did. When that dif-
ficulty was quieted down, a brother of the Sultan made claims
to his throne and the Dutch settled that matter and then just
took over the whole kingdom, but with the understanding that the
Susuhunan, as the Sultan was called, should keep on ruling with
his headquarters at Solo where he already was. The kingdom
was divided, and the brother set up at Djockja. In each Court
a Prince was appointed by the Resident, who is supported by the
