ALBERT E. WALKER,
COUNSELLOR AT LAW.
(Including Patent Causes.)

Hartford, Connecticut,

If the colored leaders take
to denouncing the Supreme Court,
they will alienate the sympathies
of their best friends in the North.
The abolition of slavery; the
prohibition of discriminatory
state laws; the exclusion of
the ballot to the colored man:
these are secure. If the colored
leader denounce discrimination for
not also punished by laws, the
unauthorized and assumed exclu-
sion of colored people from
particular private property
and of hotels & restaurants it
will look rather childish. It
will tend to show that the colored
people care more for the show
than for the substance of citizenship.
