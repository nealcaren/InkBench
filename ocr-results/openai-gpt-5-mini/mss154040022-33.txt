We leave tonight and have "done" China. We have visited ten towns: Hong Kong, Macao, Canton, Shanghai, Nanking, Hankow, Peking, Nankow, Shanhaiguan and Mukden. We have had seven (7) kinds of money: Hong Kong, Canton, Shanghai, Nanking, Hankow, Peking and Mukden. The funniest thing was that the Peking silver dollar was worth in small silver 110 cents and those who changed it could get in addition 6 copper cents. The same dollar here is worth 100Â¾ Japanese cents, but the 100 cents of which it is composed in the silver with 116 Chinese cents and with 100 cents face value is only worth 84 Japanese cents: This is the worst dazzle-dazzle on money we have found.
