Captain's instructions and some directions on crepe paper
describing the two varieties. She didn't get anything
my letter to Chin Camp. Districts dependly stated they
could from the Instructions at $3 per 100. just why
any one in that office shouldn't know crepe paper
is a mystery. I should think they might think
the campaign consists mostly of paper designs.
The result is that Rochester didn't get to head-
quarters decreared for May 2. and the Captains
gathered for my conference cannot take the
decorations home with them. That is a long
way from efficiency. Please see what is
the matter and who doesn't know crepe
paper. I could scarcely believe her.

See you Wednesday a.m. I mean today

am wanted.
