Rochester, N.Y., Aug 17 1877-

Friend Douglass.

I started from Rochester yesterday
morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake.
Tonight at 6 oclock I was in the swamp
a few [holes] north of the Rush Reservoir.
I attached a pocket instrument upon the
wire and communicated with the person
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your
postal card. Before I left home I recd
your telegram, & went to the Roch. Sav. Bk.
where the dft was procured and notified
them of its non reception, and of your wish
for a duplicate. They said that they
could not give another until they had
received [?] from the Clearing house
at NY. which would be the first week
