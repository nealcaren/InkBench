only for a short time -
I think I shall be there
about five weeks - I shall
be back in England on
the 23rd of August - My
poor old father will be
very glad & happy to see me

been no change I have been

few weeks of rest - they
did not yield me to have
any alteration - yet they would
not hear all by months of
separation from their own children
