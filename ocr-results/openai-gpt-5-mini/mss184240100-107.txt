Boston Dec'r 25th.

My dear Miss Dickinson

Your favor of
the 19th containing a draft
for five hundred dollars -
came safely to hand;
and I should have
acknowledged its receipt
at once: - but it astounded
both [Leavitt?] and myself, till we
do even too little: we
are now better and
hope to continue so;
at all events we shall
try.  Many thanks
for your favor. â€”
[Leavitt?] sends much
love to you & your Mother.

Ever yours truly
Wm [?]
