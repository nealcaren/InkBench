(1) The senseless Waste of War
When the great War began $11 billions of old War debts
stood upon the border of Europe - the total coin money
& bullion in circulation in the whole world was about
eleven billions of dollars. yet the nations plunged
all well into the war, borrowing all they could,
printing paper money; & not stopping to count the
cost. at the end the international debts were so
complicated & burdensome that a universal panic
followed. What senseless waste! Any wonder they
can not pay their debts to us?
Do you know that every man killed in the late
War cost the living $17,000?
Let me read you a little dialogue, an extract from
a conversation between a king & his prime minister,
in the 3rd century before Christ. Cyrus - Pyrrhus

2 When we the people So Will
When the generation that has not experienced
War ceases to see hear or read of the glories of War,
but know the facts & refuse to repeat such
history - when women refuse the glamor of
war trappings, war music, war propaganda
& take intelligent stand in elections
