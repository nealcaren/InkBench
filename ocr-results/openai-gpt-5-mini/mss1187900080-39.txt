Hon Fredrick Douglass
Washington S.C.                                 Dear Sir

I am an Ex union soldier and
have Endeavored to be a con-

the organization of that party.
I have resided in the South a
greater portion of the time
since the civil war and in
my humble sphere in life
have been a friend to the

reside at present in                         586
