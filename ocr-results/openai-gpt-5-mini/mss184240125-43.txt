I came to Boston in Nov. to
make a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken, does
not break easily. I thought I should
see you here this spring, because the papers
said so. It has been a trying winter,
but spring & violets are near the door.
Aggie writes me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work will do itself.
But if she is shut in, she so hates
in-door "duties" - that she frets, the harness
chafes. She has a good-practical sense, to
keep her from doing unheard of things. Taint
easy. God bless you dear - always.

Lovingly - Mamma Leary.
