EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVES OF REBELS.
[To accompany bill H. R. No. 472.]

JUNE 17, 1862. â€” Ordered to be printed.

Mr. NOEL, from the committee on confiscation and emancipation of the
slaves of rebels, reported the following as

THE VIEWS OF THE MINORITY.

The undersigned, from the select committee to whom was referred the
House bill No. 472, for the emancipation of the slaves of rebels, with
instructions to report a substitute, being unable to agree with the major-
ity of the committee in supporting said substitute, begs leave to submit
the following minority report:

The substitute treats slaves as persons owing service to certain
other persons; not as property belonging to them. The theory of the
substitute is that there are certain relations existing between two
classes of persons in the States, by virtue of the local laws thereof.
I do not believe that any power exists to repeal, alter, or modify, by
federal legislation, such local laws so as permanently to change those
relations. By virtue of the local laws, mutual obligations are created
or implied between the persons who owe the service and the persons
to whom the service is due. It is not in the power of Congress to
impair the obligations of this express or implied contract. Confisca-
tion seizes and condemns property as property, but does not change
the legal status of persons in a State, which legal status results from
local and not from federal laws. Emancipation changes the status of
persons from the condition of slavery to the condition of freedom,
thereby changing the local, political, and social organization. The
question of war or peace cannot affect the power of Congress over
the subject. The exigencies of war end with the war.

Prisoners may be taken in war and held during the war; but when
peace is restored the prisoner must be released and remitted back to
his original condition. Why is this? It is because the exigencies
of war require his capture in the first place, but do not require his
detention when the war is over. So the military authority may, if
necessary for military purposes, suspend the right of the master to
the service of his slave, but a return of peace removes the necessity,
and the slave is remitted to his original status. If we treat slaves
as property, I have no doubt of our right to confiscate them as other
