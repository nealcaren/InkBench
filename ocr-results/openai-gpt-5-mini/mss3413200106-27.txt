Dear Miss Blackwell, -

I am blessed with a propensity to be always at something. You are something; still you will not draw an illogical conclusion, as three successive epistles might tempt a less reasonable creature to do.

The truth is, it's hot, hot beyond creed, to say nothing of deed. What resource else was left but you. The other evening, so & so was spoken of to me as having done this and that as nurse in the war. I was called on to admire her. I had to say, "yes, I admire what she did. But must she not be a noble woman to do so much." Then I said it's very well for us - you and she & me, to do some good. No the only recommendation we can have; But really I look to see one who would need no creed to recommend him, seeing whom one thinks not how much he has done or can do, but how much he is.

I apprehend I was talking Greek, & can't go further; but you who understand Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
