My Dear father.

I have received your
kind letter and was
very glad to hear
from you. but I am so
sorry that you feel
so about going to
Rochester, I hope it will
be all right thair,
when you go thair. I
shall take good care of your
letters and not think of
distroying them in any way,
we have had a few very
Cold days but we have
more pleasant weather.
