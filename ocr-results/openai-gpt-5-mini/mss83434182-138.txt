I can’t confidently transcribe the small, rotated type on this page from the supplied image. The page is upside-down and many of the table entries are too small to read accurately at this resolution.

I can, however, transcribe the clear heading that’s visible at the bottom of the image:

BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA. 133

If you can, please upload a higher-resolution version of the image and/or rotate it so the text is upright. I’ll then provide a complete, line‑by‑line transcription.
