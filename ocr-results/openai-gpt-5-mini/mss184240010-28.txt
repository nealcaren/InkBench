else he would go & spread the slur
he had so importunately & carelessly
told Annie.  Among the letters thee
will find Mrs. Baxter's bill, sent
in through the mail; I mention it
to call attention to the fact that
she has included in it the $250
in money, which is down on the bill
I sent thee, of which thee can take
note, when it is paid, in crossing off
on the account.  Annie says two or three
ladies called the other day & did
not leave their names, but said
they would see thee again.  Also
that another one, giving the name
of Mary Johnson, called the other
day to ask "if miss Anna lack
anything for them" - I don't know
who she is, though Annie says she
has been here several times before.

My poor old German teacher,
Prof. Rose, has gone to his long
home - was buried last Sunday.
Thee will remember my speaking
of his failing health.

note from Sam'l on the
inside of this envelope

Milton 10 mo 8th, 67
Dearly loved daughter -
Another birth day
anniversary at hand.
Only think! twenty five
mile marks; and the
beautiful spring time
of life's pilgrimage already
left behind. How has the
love and providence of
the Father of the fatherly
been with thee and around
about thee, from the dawn
of life, even until now,
