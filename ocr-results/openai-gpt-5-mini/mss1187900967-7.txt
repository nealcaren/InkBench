were at your house?  Nevertheless

should you come, a father's house
a father's home, a father's welcome
will be given you.  You would
find me in very pleasant surroundings
not quite such as I have on Cedar
Hill - yet very well adapted to
this climate and country.  I

note what you say of young
Cooke. I am sorry to learn that
he has made so little progress.
I feel even more sorry still to
know that he deserved Annie
such a mean trick.  She
did a good deal for him. That
is perhaps, the trouble. Had she
done well [the] she would have
received more thanks.  Gratitude
is not a very strong feature
of the colored race.
