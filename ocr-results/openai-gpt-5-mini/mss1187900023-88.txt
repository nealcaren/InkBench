to Belfast stopping however in this city
long enough to hold two meetings. I shall
not accompany him to Belfast or
in any part of Ireland. He will have
the field to himself. I could wish to be with him
at Cork but it will not be in my power.
I am now about to tell you something
which will make you think me the
most fickle of men. I have decided
to stay in this country six months longer
and I should not wonder if Mr Wright
should do the same. Though I am sure
with far less reason than I have to
justify me in staying, I have decided
to stay in consequence of the advice both
of Mr Garrison and Mr Thompson.
Both think the present a most
favorable opportunity for remodelling
the anti-slavery feeling of this country
and bringing it to the aid of the true
anti-slavery society in America â€”
and each think it would be wrong for me
to miss it. I have therefore decided to stay.
