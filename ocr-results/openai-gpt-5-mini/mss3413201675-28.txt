TV Swaps To Give Viewers Idea Of Seeing Double

By ELEANOR ROBERTS

There are so many guest shot "swaps" on television next season that viewers will think they're seeing double.

(SINATRA SWAPPING,
SHOTS WITH MARTIN)

Frankie Sinatra is swapping guest shots with Dean Martin who, in turn, will return the courtesy on the Sinatra special. And Milton Berle is not only involved with Danny Thomas who'll make a return appearance on Uncle Miltie's special but he's doing a swap with Lucy-Desi, too.

All the networks want big names because this is a season of stars.
With more than 20 special scheduled the race for talent is terrific.

And the stars, fully aware of this, are holding back. Where once they would have signed with no hesitation for the Dinah
Shore, Perry Como, Ed Sullivan, Steve Allen and Garry Moore variety shows they're playing hard-to-get and reserving themselves for the specials.

Exposure to too many variety shows has suddenly become an occupational hazard for them. As Polly Bergen told us in an earlier interview, she planned to limit her guest shots and hold out for specials because she didn't want audiences to tire of seeing her on too many variety shows with no special role to play.

DINAH SHORE

Speaking of the stars' solid billing, Dean Martin is booked into 1961.

DINAH SHORE'S new wardrobe should really be an eye-opener. She's been picking up glamorous gowns from famous couturiers in every country she has visited on her European tour.

Dinah stopped off with husband George Montgomery and daughter Melinda in Israel and bought a beautiful gown in Tel Aviv. Leon Uris' best-seller "Exodus" inspired her visit to Israel where she was a guest of the govern-
ment.

Breats there a comedian with
so sad a road that he doesn't yearn
to be a dramatic star? Apparently not, with so many of them—Ed Wynn, Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason, etc.—making a whack at straight drama.

The newest one to join the circle is comedian GEORGE GOBEL who'll star in his first straight dramatic role on TV in General Electric Theatre's "They Like Me Fine", next season.

Gobel plays the role of a small-
time night club comic who gets his biggest laughs from members of his family. Very "Kaplacic"? George's own alternate show kicks off Sunday, Oct. 11, CH. 7, 10:30-11:30.

MUST BE THE NEW HARDNO
or what gives with Hermione
Gingold who looked so different on the video-taped "I've Got A Secret". Wednesday night Posi-
tively years younger and quite ac-
tractive in a sleek, too-too sort of way.

She even did glamour-touched on the JACK PAAR show when she helped him celebrate his an-
niversary with Dodie Goodman and Genevieve, not long ago.

Scent HIGH PRICE TAGS, the word is around that Ingrid Berg-
man will get $100,000 for "Turn of the Screw" . . . And the film being given out on NBC-TV's prestigious series alone is staggering—$57,000,000.

Turns out that HARRY BELAFONTE who thought he could
Welk, Gisele MacKenzie and Phil
Harris will cavort with the
Schnozella, instead, on his Sept.
25 spec.

Whew, the mad dash for talent is really at its peak. Producer David Susskind is after ANTHONY QUINN to play the title role of Don Quixote in his upcoming Du Pont Show of the Month "The Man Who Was Don Quixote" story that includes incidents from the life of Miguel de Cervantes, author of the novel. Susskind has his eye on Mexico's top comedy star, Cantiflas, to play Don Quixote's squire, Sancho Panza.

"BACHELOR FATHER" fans will see their hero in a TV role that, at last, does justice to his dramatic ability. He'll play Sam-
my's (Larry Blyden's) discoverer in "What Makes Sammy Run?"

THE JOHNNY STACCATO series (more jazz and more slinky
private-eye stuff) may be changed to just "Staccato," seeing the opposing CBS-TV title is "Johnny Rocco" and would it be a pity if NBC viewers got the wrong Johnny?

Pick Of The Weekend
All-Star Football Tops Tonight

Tonight
By DICK KLEINER

BEST BET—Smack in the middle of August, we've got ourselves the first football game of the season tonight. This is the annual kick-off of the kick-off season, THE COLLEGE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME from Chicago's Soldier Field. Each year, the cream of last season's graduating collegians meet the pro champs, in this case the Baltimore Colts. As usual, it should be a passing contest, with Dan's Colts' John Unitas and the All-
Stars' Lee Grosscup (who'll play pro this year with the New York Giants) matching tosses. This is always a colorful game, with bands and half-time formalities and players passing out from the heat, 9:30 (Ch. 5).

7:30-8:30 (Ch. 7)—RAWHIDE retreats its steps back to the spot on the trail where everybody started dropping from poisoned food. Seems a pack of high IQ rustlers doused the vittles with powdered convote weed, a lethal seasoning. The object of their black game was to kill off the whole crew so they could swipe the cattle. They reckon
without Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood.

9:30 (Ch. 7)—The plot for tonight's PHIL SILVERS SHOW repeats has an "Annie Get Your Gun" flavor. There's a sharp shooting contest and, after one thing and another, Bill takes his healthy wad on a WAC who promptly falls in love—and you can't get a man with a gun. Peggy Cass has a ball as the deadeye dame.

9:30 (Ch. 7)—STRIPE PLAYHOUSE is repeating a Schlitz Playhouse original which is a solid detective story. It's a tricky murder tale called "No Answer", with Keenan Wynn the super-sleuth and Donald Cook the prime suspect. He seems to

matter how diabolical he is.
Both Conrad and Beindix are cautious while working with young Teddy—he's the biggest scene thief in the whole county. 10-11 (Ch. 4).

6:30 (Ch. 2)—An excellent guided tour of the U.S. is pre-
sided by CHET HUNTLEY RE-
PORTING, but there's a larger purpose. It's a suggested itinerary for Premier Khrushchev on his visit here and includes visits to wheat and corn fields in Iowa, a look at an integrated community in Levittown, Pa., a thinking machine center in Cam-
bridge, Mass., New York City, the Los Alamos plant, wells and
thence to California for an illus-
tration of how a desert was con-
verted into a lush valley. 8-9 (Ch. 7)—It's business as usual on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW even though the headliners is off in Russia looking for Soviet sword-swallwers. This one taped last June and features Lionel Hampton and a small group in some feverish jazz. Jan Peerce, the Metropolitan Opera lad who also
