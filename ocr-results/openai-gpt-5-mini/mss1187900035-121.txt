I have had a most
advantageous Situation
offered me - in Mr. Reddie's
to take of the first family
at the Ranch - Well - that
I accepted it - I would
have contracted very
sympathy for the Poles
which would be matchless, I rejected
it - though it was
again and again pressed
upon me - this very day
I received a Telegraph
from Petersburg - urging
me to accept the Situation.
I was glad to be able
to write to Counter [?] that I was engaged
in an English family - It
would not have been
long before I should
have been sent to Berlin
