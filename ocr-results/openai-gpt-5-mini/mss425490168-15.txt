PRESS RELEASE: For PMs, Thursday, March 30.

a test case on the District of Columbia anti-discrimination laws of 1872 and
1873 will be tried in D.C. Court on Friday, March 31.  The case, "Dist. of Columbia
v. John R. Thompson Co.", will take place on the 2nd floor, Municipal Court, Criminal
Division, 5th St. between E and F Sts. NW, at 1:30 PM.

The Thompson Cafeteria at 725 14th St. NW is to be prosecuted by the DC corpo-
ration counsel for violation of the 1872 and 1873 laws against discrimination
because of color in restaurants and other public places. Clark King will be prose-
cuting attorney. The complaining witnesses on whose complaint Mr. King is acting
are:

    Mary Church Terrell -- for two terms a member of the D.C.Board of Education;
        charter member, NAACP.

    David H. Scull -- Member of the Society of Friends.

    Rev. Arthur F. ?lmes -- Pastor of the Peoples Congregational Church.

    Miss Essie Thompson -- member of the United Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union.

The witnesses were refused service at the Thompson cafeteria on Feb. 28, 1950
on the ground that three of the group are colored, by Mr. S.T.Becker, regional
superintendent of the Washington-Baltimore district of the Thompson chain.

According to a ruling of the corporation counsel, the law against discriminati n
for color in restaurants is now in effect, but no further prosecutions will be a
acted upon, although complaints will be accepted for further prosecution, until
the courts have ruled on the Thompson case. Some restaurants have opened their
doors to all patrons since the commissioners announced on Feb. 21, 1950, through
the corporation counsel, that the law is still in effect. The Washington Rest-
aurant Assn. has advised its members not to obey the law at present.

An amicus curiae brief will be filed by the Coordinating Committee for the
Enforcement of the D.C.Anti-Discrimination Laws. (This group was organized after
the D.C. chapter of the Natl. Lawyers Guild published an opinion in May 1949
holding that the laws have never been repealed, and has been concerned solely with
their being put into effect. The amicus brief reviews the changing and inconsistent
segregation pattern in Washington and affirms that the citizens of the city are
favorably disposed to the enforcement of the laws. Mrs. Margaret A. Haywood is
the attorney representing the committee.

Because of the widespread interest in the case, it is expected that a number
of other organizations will appear as friends of the court to file amicus briefs.

The John R. Thompson Co. is represented by Mr. Ringgold Hart, attorney for the
Washington Restaurant Assn.

Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, chairman of the committee seeking enforcement of
the laws stated:

    "Those who are trying to enforce the anti-discrimination laws
    here in Washington are rendering their country a great service.
    They are trying to stop it from being disgraced any longer by
    preventing hotels and restaurants from refusing to serve colored
    people in the capital of what is called the greatest democracy
    on earth."
