And sin-wrecked men with eager hands
did grasp each golden word,
And with my heart I drew them on
To see my precious Lord

Again I stood beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransomed throng
The Lord had given me.

F. E. W. Harper.

Growing old.

The prison house in which I live
Is falling to decay,
But God renews my spirit's strength
Within - these walls of clay.

For me a dimmed cloud-cup
Around Earth's faint-light -
But heaven grows closer to my view
And nearer to my sight.
