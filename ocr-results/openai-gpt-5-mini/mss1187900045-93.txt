we make it a point of [?] first pre meetings "where
farewells are next," said -
I remember your "which you
dear Frederick's dislike" he always
told - but - let me say, I am
simply, that I never found
my dear Saviour so near, so
precious as now - amidst
the many trials & heart ten-
tings - I do's appoint[ments?] I
have gone through. I can
realize that "all things
must, will & are working
together for good - - When
we reach yonder glorious
city, we shall be, as dear
friends, be enable'd to look
back on all the way the
Lord our God has led us to
humble us - & prove us" -
May our loving Heavenly Father
bless you in every prayer
your ever faithful and
affectionate
