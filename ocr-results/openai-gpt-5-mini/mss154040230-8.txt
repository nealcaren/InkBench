My Dear Madam:

I have had several interviews with the Minister of Foreign
Relations, Se√±or Honorio Pueyrredon and his secretary, in which
the following has been established; The Argentine government is
not able to name an official delegate, which here would be con-
sidered as the delegate of the government, for the Congress of
Baltimore is not official, that is, it is not organized by the
government of the United States. This is clearly established by
the note of Nov. 28, 1921; a copy of, which has been officially sent
to me, delivered to the Charge d'Affaire of the United States,
Mr. Francis White, in which he says, "In transmitting this invit-
ation to the government of your excellency, I must draw your atten-
tion to the fact that the invitation is not official, in that it
emanates from a private organization; and that, although the
Government of the United States sees with pleasure all conferences
which have as object the promotion of friendly understanding and
closer relations between the citizens of the American Republics,
it will have no part in the coming conference."

The Charge D'Affairs had an interview with the Minister,
and following this, it was told me that he had shown much interest
in our last conversation, insisting to the Minister that the affair
be settled.

In view of the Congress not being official, the only thing
which our Minister of Foreign Relations can do, is to communicate
through diplomatic channels, that is to say officially; -- thus
