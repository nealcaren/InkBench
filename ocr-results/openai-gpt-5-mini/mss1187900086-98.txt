Dear Frederick Douglass

When we first saw your
appointment to Hoyt's - and also how
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you
I began to clip and stick them with
the intention of sending them all on
to you - I cut "lots" of them, but alas!
in the huge piles of editorial scraps
they have all disappeared but those
I enclose.

It was pleasant to see the
appreciation in which you are held,
while you are alive to see it.

I am not sure that we are glad
to have you go. We need you
here.
