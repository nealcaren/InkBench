circumstances are at present against him. But he is
young and poor in pocket and no doubt unable to
discharge his duty in respect of the unavoidable expense
of the sickness and death of his noble and devoted wife
- the saint of his life - gentle Annie.

Let me pray you then, not to judge him yet. Wait,
suspend final conclusion as to him for I cannot
help but believe that in all the course of his
love and marriage of the dear dead girl who loved him
so devotedly he meant well and true. His errors
I think have been those of judgment only.

You must pardon me for speaking at all on the sub-
ject for it is one sacred to your own heart and home, but
I know that you were fond of him; and would now, even
if no one knew it, be pleased if he proved worthy of a place
in your family circle. Having said so much to you because
I love you and I always liked Morris, I am done and shall
never open my lips again upon the subject to any living soul.

I hope that next Sunday may prove as fine a day
as this and that we shall meet in all our bravery
at 934 "E" st. N.W., with the good company of our
host and hostess and their little ones.

Affectionately yours,
Wm H. H. Hart
