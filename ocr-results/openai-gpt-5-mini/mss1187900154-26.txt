My dear Mr. Douglass:

I leave for the East early
tomorrow morning & now I have put off so
long my calling on you & Mrs. Douglass that
I shall be unable to do so.  Do make my
excuses to you [?] wife for me.  I remember
her with so much pleasure in Paris.  I hope
to bring them to Chicago later in the summer &
then I will not fail to see you both.  In
the meanwhile believe me,

Very truly yours,

Theodore Stanton,
26 West 61st St.,
