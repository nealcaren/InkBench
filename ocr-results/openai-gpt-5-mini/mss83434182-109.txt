I can read the page header, table headings and the cemetery title, but the individual rows are too small/blurred for an accurate word-for-word transcription of every name and entry. I don’t want to guess or introduce errors. If you can provide a higher-resolution or closer crop of the table (especially the left-hand area with the numbers/names and the columns), I’ll transcribe the entire page precisely.

What I can transcribe now (exactly as it appears at the top and left of the page):

104
UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN

BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA — Continued.

Column headings (left to right, as shown):
No.
Name.
Rank.
Co.
Regiment.
Date of death.
Sec.
Grave.
Remarks.

If you upload a higher-resolution or zoomed-in image of the table rows, I will provide a complete, line-by-line transcription.
