insted of makeing Marilla nd Biskett I would try
send you a line. I hope
you will excuse Bad wreting
and Spelling as you will
find. I have seen Miss
Kriger twice since you
left. every thing is going
on just the same so I have
no nerves to tell
you all are well at
home hoping that
you are. Ross is well
and sends love to you.

Truly your
friend
