No. 81.  Monkey Temple.  Two hundred monkeys live in the trees surrounding the temple.  Only one cot in the picture.  They eat from the hands of strangers and the mother monkeys snatch away their babies when they think they have had enough, and run up the trees with them.

No. 82.  The burning ghat of the Hindoos on shore of Ganges.  The body on the frame is tying feet in the holy water of the river before burning.  About six may be burning at once.  When complete, the attendants sweep ashes, and unburned fingers, legs or arms into the river.
