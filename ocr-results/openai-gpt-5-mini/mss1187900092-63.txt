My dear Sir,

I saw it here yesterday,
on my way I heard your speech, thought I
heard you with pleasure deliver it.  I
had more impressed with it as I read it
last night.  I read it to my father - he
was much pleased & united with me
in pronouncing it able.  You should
deliver it throughout the country, it will
do great good. --

Yours truly
W. B. [?]
