Dear Mary;

I received a book yesterday - the 27th
gift this spring! If this book tells how to attain
success with a book when the author (would be)
has nothing sense nor pep and no vocabulary
to express the public though it he has, it will be most
welcome. Until I have read it I shall not know
whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or
without thanks either way! I am sending you
a tiny box of light overseas. Who is no good? I just
had these left over & don't the remotest idea
what any of these are, but we will find out.
If you were nearer I should know how to give you
a gardenful of plants from the greenhouse â€”
all of which will either die in my garden or
give wintered little blossoms. Haywood has
been stalwart wonders in yours! When you
come down, I shall take you to see a garden
that is worth looking at.
