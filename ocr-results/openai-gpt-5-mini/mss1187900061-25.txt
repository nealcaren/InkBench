Legation of the United States,
Manchuria, Siberia,
July 20, 1883.

Honorable
Fredk Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

I read your
speech delivered on the occasion
commemoration of Emancipa-
tion in the District of Columbia
and was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterances,
and surprised at the vigor and
brilliancy of your powers after
an almost constant deprivation
of them for nearly a half cen-
tury in the cause of our oppress-
ed people.
