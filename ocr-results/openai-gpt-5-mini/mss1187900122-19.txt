London Sunday May 6, 94.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

Your letter directed to Manchester has followed me all round till it reached me here. I am indeed glad to get it. When I wrote to you I had not seen your letter to Mr. Aksd; since seeing it I know from what he and others said, that while they did not expect "gush" (may they pay you the same compliment I do, in knowing you to be incapable of such a thing) still they would have been better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. Mr. Ak[e?] thought that since the society had failed so miserably and I was thus left without (for myself) you would not hesitate vouch for me. We cannot go thro the country telling people about this personal al quarrel and why I am unaccompanied by the persons who brought me over. As the best known member of the race, a positive letter or voucher
