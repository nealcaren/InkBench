[? Bleadwell note and]

There were many pleasant things to diversify the [hard] brighten the [years] hard work.

Louisa Alcott, then at the height of her popularity, wrote in re-
ply to a request for her help:

Concord, Oct. 1, 1873.

Dear Mrs. Stone:

I am so busy just now proving "Woman's Right to Labor" that I have
no time to help prove "Woman's right to Vote." I read your note aloud
to the family, asking, "What shall I say to Mrs. Stone?" A voice from
the transcendental fog which usually obscures my honored father
instantly replied, "Tell her you are ready to follow your leader, sure
that you could not have a better one." My brave old mother, with the
ardor of many unquenchable rays shining in her face, cried out, "Tell
her I am seventy-three, but I mean to go to the polls before I die,
even if my three daughters have to carry me." And two little men,
already mustered in, added the cheering words, "Go ahead, Aunt Needy,
we will [let] you vote as much as ever you like."

Such being the temper of the small Convention of which I am now
president, I cannot hesitate to say that, though I may not be with
you in the body, I shall be in spirit, and am, as ever,

Hopefully and heartily yours,
Louisa May Alcott.

Miss Alcott dropped in at the office of the Suffrage Association
one day and left a check for a hundred dollars, saying that she had [and]
earned it before breakfast. In those days a hundred dollars was a [les] large sum.
