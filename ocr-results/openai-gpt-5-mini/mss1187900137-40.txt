Washington, D. C., April 11th 1903
609 - 7th. n.w.

Mr B. F. Leighton,
Dear Sir:

Yours of the 6th inst. was duly received, the contents of which was carefully noted by Mr Lewis Douglass;

In reply, he desired me to say that he has no disposition, whatever, to make any change regarding a store step on the premises referred to in your letter.

On the contrary, he desires Mrs Helen Douglass' attention called to the fact that said premises is in immediate need of improvement both in and out, the back walls, the broken blinds, and especially the sanitary apartments, make it almost untenantable. It is also sadly in need of a coat of paint, which, in its conspicuous position, makes a most detestable appearance.

It is the only residence in that immediate neighborhood that stands as a disgrace to the landlord.

Respectfully yours, Joseph Douglass
2598 clerk
