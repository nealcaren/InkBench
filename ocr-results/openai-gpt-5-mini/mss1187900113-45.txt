all this to acquire necessary experience & to be
rewarded by these I would [?] that I fully know
their trouble & could not but make common cause
with them - If so it is but a blessing in disguise.

And now let me add that on Easter eve I
was sought by the Director of Home Institute
mentioned in an annexed paper - to tell me he had
proof that "Philanthropic money" as he called it could
be found in the North (in fact had been offered)
at low interest for such work as it had hinted
& to which he added the suggestions mentioned
and attracted my attention to Part 4 page 1 of the
Daily Inter- [*Chicago?*] of 25 March giving an account
of a successful coloured colonization at Tuskegee
Alabama - to which I refer you, as also some to interest
you.  It was a number of 62 pages printed at
[?] a [?] of copies as its 21st anniversary & which
contains very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair.  When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion & counsel how best to proceed.
I feel sure of your sympathy for the cause &
perhaps "for auld lang syne" no more, - hopefully
& with very best wishes of the season for your
continued prosperity, ever
most truly yours
