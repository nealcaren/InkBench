Building
the Builders
of Chicago

J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year),
Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and
Jimmy Jones ($16 bucks a week), rally
to the nearest P. & E. Restaurant. The baked
beans go big with Cornelius—Barbara says
the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy goes
hard for the soup and a big cut of that
spicy mince pie.

You are building a better Chicago—we are
building better Chicagoans.

RUTH McCORMICK,
DENEEN SOUND
CAMPAIGN CRIES

Senator Attacks County
Administration.

BY PARKE BROWN.

Both United States Senator Deneen
and Representative Ruth Hanna Mc-
Cormick, who has announced her can-
didacy against him, manifested yes-
terday what was construed as a de-
sire to see the actual campaign start-
ed, although each has chosen the first
week in January for the opening of
real hostilities.

Senator Deneen addressed more than
1,000 of his followers—Chicago ward
committeemen, country town precinct
committeemen, and officeholders—at a
luncheon at the Hotel Morrison. It
was a closed meeting, but later the
senator made public part of his
speech, a criticism of the condition
existing in the local government.

Mr. McCormick, just before leaving
for his Washington, on an afternoon
train, issued a statement charging
that a "propaganda factory" is cir-
culating false yarns that she is not
a bona fide candidate. She said that
not only does she intend to remain in
the race, but also she expects to win
the nomination.

Deneen Raps County Rule.

"Since the election of 1928," read
Senator Deneen's manuscript, "every
week has revealed in some measure
the character of the misfeasance,
malfeasance, or malaparence [sic] [malfeasance?] (?) of public officials in this county.

"The people have been deceived,
hoodwinked, and in part have per-
mitted unworthy prejudice to influence
their votes. In part they have been
influenced by small favors to them
and in the large by the personal good
will and beastly plunder of the co-ope-
rative public plunder.

"I say the people have permitted
unworthy motives to influence their
votes by tolerating the breakdown of
law and order and economic and ef-
ficient government in our local po-
litical administration.

"The economic laws have moved
slowly but mightily against the con-
duct of public officials and the lethargy
of the public itself.

Penalty of Bankruptcy.

"The bankruptcy in the character
of public officials which has been ap-
proved or tolerated by our people is
now followed by bankruptcy in al-
most every department of government.
The economic law are as remorseless
as the natural laws, and we will all
soon pay the penalty of what we have
approved or tolerated in our local gov-
ernment.

"We are to pay for it in high taxes;
enormous interest on borrowed funds;
to conduct the government day by
day; impaired police and fire protec-
tion and the lack of cleanliness in our
city; the abuse of the public health; the lack of the
sick must suffer, and the children
and the youth of the city must be de-

in the past was theirs by mere right
of birth.

"Have I overstated conditions in
our community? Political condition
brought about these results, but the
defend[?] penalties are personal and
affect our community as a whole.

"There will be no need to cite
political conditions or create issues in
the coming primaries. Every one
knows the facts. The contest will
come to the personally of the can-
didates, their ability and experience and
character. They will be judged by
their intelligence, initiative, energy,
and sense of public service. Our duty
is plain enough.

Senator Condemns Prejudice.

"In this great campaign let us em-
phasize that those who appeal to the
prejudices of our citizens for votes
and those citizens who permit their
prejudices to determine their votes
who are equally unworthy and merit
public condemnation.

"The task of equalizing the bur-
dens of government and restoring
government to its proper functions
calls for the best judgement of our
citizens.

"Let those who vote for illegal
favors and for hire and those who
grant illegal favors and pay bribes
be exposed and the enemies of the gov-
ernment and of the people."

Senator Deneen—outside his manu-
script—also told his followers that his
group has made no deal on a county
ticket with any other faction or any
Republican leader outside its own fold.

Mrs. McCormick's Statement.

The statement of Mrs. McCormick
read as follows:

"Reports recently circulated in Chi-
cago by my political opponents are in-
tended to confuse the public as to the

that I am going to withdraw from the
race for the United States senator-
ship. The Republicans of the state
have been asked to believe that I
have made a deal whereby I will with-
draw from the present contest and
take the race two years hence.

"These and other false reports have
been spread over the state with such
persistent energy that they at least
do credit to the industry of the propa-
ganda factory that is sending them
out. It appears that in making these
predictions the wits has been left to
the thought.

"She's in Senate Race.

"I want to say emphatically now
that I am in the race for the Repub-
lican nomination for United States
senator and that I shall be in the race
every minute up to the closing of the
polls on April 8, 1930.

"I traveled 24,000 miles in the state
of Illinois in 1927 and 1928 in my cam-
paign for Congress and visited every
county in the state. I am going to
make an even more vigorous cam-
paign for the senate. I have estab-
lished state headquarters on the twelve-
teenth floor of the London Guaranty
and Accident building, 360 North Mich-
igan avenue.

"I am returning to Washington to-
day to attend to sessions of the an-
nual river and harbor congress, and
to continue my regular duties in the
house of representatives. I plan to
start my speaking campaign immedi-
ately on my return from Washington
on Jan. 6; and my time thereafter will
be so divided that my work in Il-
linois will require a minimum of in-
terruption of my duties in congress.

"I not only propose to press my
campaign vigorously but I expect to
be nominated on April 8, 1930."

Announces G. O. P. Meeting.

B. W. Snow, vice campaign of the
Republican county central committee,
announced that the committee will be
called into session next Friday after-

room to tackle the task of reorganiza-
tion made possible by the withdrawals
of former Chairman Homer K. Galpin
and Robert E. Crowe, former state's
attorney. The meeting probably will
be held in the Hotel La Salle at 2
o'clock.

Among the speakers at a testimonial
dinner to Judge Marcus Kavanaugh
at the Congress hotel tonight are list-
ed Charles S. Whitman, former gov-
ernor of New York; the Rev. John
Cavanaugh, president emeritus of Notre
Dame university; Brig. Gen. Milton J.
Foreman, James Hamilton Lewis and
Silas H. Strawn.

WIFE DIVORCES,
MORSE IN RENO;
HE LOSES PLEA

Reno, Nev., Dec. 9—(Special.)
Jared Kirtland Morse of the chemistry
department, University of Chicago,
and former architect of New York,
today lost a divorce action he insti-
tuted at week ago when his wife, Elea-
nor Chapin Morse, was awarded the
decree.

The decree was allowed Mrs. Morse
upon the deposition alleging that he
had deserted her during an illness.
Mrs. Morse was awarded $4,500 a year
alimony for herself and an adopted
child, 17 years of age, now in her
custody. They were married at Roch-
ester, N. Y., in July, 1916.

In his complaint Morse alleged his
wife had been a hindrance to his am-
bition to study scientific research, and
that when he joined the faculty of the
University of Chicago she came to
live with him, but constantly nagged
him. Mrs. Morse denied his allega-
tions.
