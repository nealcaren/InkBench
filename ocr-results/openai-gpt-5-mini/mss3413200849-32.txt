MEMORIAL SET UP
TO DR. EMILY LEWI

Friends of the late Dr. Emily
Lewi presented a check for $14,000
yesterday to the trustees of the
New York Infirmary to start an
endowment fund in her memory.
Income will be used for the care of
ailing women physicians connected
with the infirmary and their chil-
dren.

The check was presented to Mrs.
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of
the board of trustees, by Dr.
Marion Mantor, medical director of
the infirmary, at the end of a
meeting of the trustees in the
Fuller Building, 597 Madison Ave.

Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Lewi:
"She was one of the older doctors
who had the courage of their con-
victions and the consecration to
uphold the infirmary as a center
of training and service by women
doctors. Without her work and
that of her associates the infirmary
would long since have closed its
doors."

Dr. Lewi, who died two years
ago, was a pediatrician who prac-
ticed more than fifty years and
served as director of pediatrics at
the infirmary from 1930 to 1936.
She was known as an outstanding
teacher and diagnostician and was
one of the pioneers in endocrin-
ology.

One room in the projected new
infirmary building will be known
as the Emily Lewi Memorial
Room, the trustees said, and the
endowment will support it.
