that are thoughtful people, as citizens of Ohio, of whom I fear
who have the good of the African
race at heart and a pen written
plan in the boundary of philadelphi
cal views you have taken of
the subject.  Will your address
be published in pamphlet
form?  If so, I shall order
some for circulation.  There is
not a word or thought in it
that I would have changed
in any respect.  Again I beg to
thank you for laying before the
American people so elaborate
and timely an address.  I wish
you would send a copy to
our common friend lawyer
McNeely, Hopedale, Hacman Co.
Ohio.  He is of the old abolition
party of Ohio, of whom I fear
are left, and please put some
mark on it by which he will know
from whom he receives it.

Do you
ever come west in these days?
Should you come to this city
remember you have a carriage
[?] which if you follow it,
will take you to my house
86 North Prospect St â€”

Faithfully Yours
