Concord June 14 1885 -

My dear Friend:

I have sent
you various portions of
my book in a fragment-
ary form, not having du-
plicate proofs enough to
give you what I wanted
like, just yet. I shall
soon have advance sheets
of the whole 650 pages
and will send you an
early copy should you
desire it. As I get
back proofs from others
to whom I have sent
them, I may send you
more. Today I en-
close the end of
Chapter XIV, including
Brackett's account of
his visit to Brown Univ.
