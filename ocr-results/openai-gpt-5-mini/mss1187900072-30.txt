Washington April 10th 1887

Dear Father

Your letter dated March 24th I received yesterday, it found us all well, and pleased to hear from you.

Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds is seri-
ously sick with pneumonia. Gerrit S. Soqu[en]
has been appointed Deputy Recorder of Deeds.
The lawyers are much put out about it.
Senator Sherman is making a trip South; in
Georgia, a colored delegation called at his ho-
tel, and was refused admission, as soon as
he heard of it, he paid his bill and went to
another hotel. A Colored man by the name
of Taylor from Kansas has been appointed
to the Siberian Mission. The political
air look at present on the Republican side
is wavering between Blaine and Sherman.
Congress has made an appropriation for a
new Bridge across the Eastern Branch
at the foot of Penna. Ave. Business in
the Recorders Office is booming. Griswold,
the President of the Anacostia R.R. is mar-
ried. Barrados has been appointed "Rem-
parer of deeds". The President and Mr.
Matthews have been taken back in the
prompt confirmation of Mr. Trotter. They
expected he would be rejected. Sawyer
