feel that I am growing old
am not-now what I have
been - altho' the time here
has been quite generous with
me - you will see by
this letter that it hardens
for me to write now than
in old times when my
nervousness was steady
and strong - give my
kind regards to your
Wife in which my good Ruth
heartily joins - Excuse this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friendly and well wisher
James N. Buffum

Ruth says, come and see
us. I say Amen. You have
now an engagement not
fulfilled.  J.N.B
