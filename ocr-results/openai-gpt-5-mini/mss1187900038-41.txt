Bridport Dorsetshire
October 9th 1866

My dear Mr Douglass

On our return
from our three months' tour
through France Italy & Swizer
land, we spent a few days at
Woodcote, (Brighton) before reaching
Bridport at the beginning of July - and there we found
your kind & welcome letter awaiting
us. - It is always a great pleasure
to receive one of your nice long
letters, & this one (dated May 31)
was as usual full of interest.
I trust you will have no more
such adventures as the one
you describe as having taken
place in Baltimore last winter;
it was a mercy that you es-
caped uninjured, but you might
not be so fortunate another
time, so do be prudent as to
where & how you travel; and
remember how very valuable
