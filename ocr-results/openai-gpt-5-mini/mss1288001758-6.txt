that may do for Summer-
Just this moment comes the
little boy with your letter
thank you dear dear I
sympathize with the poor
you will feel at Mr [?]'s decline. But all
things work together for good
to so good souls as yours. So
Harry dear never mind,
there must be something good
for you somewhere. Because
you deserve it. I am glad
the children are as good as
nice pies, I hope they will
keep so. Tell Mary I want
to have drive on the battery -
Please look, and see if there
is any - love to Mother & 
all - But most to you.
aff. Fanny
