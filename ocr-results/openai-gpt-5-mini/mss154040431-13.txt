ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS
IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%

"Evidence of Moral Healthiness
of German Race," Berlin
Councillor Declares.

Vienna, Dec. 12. (Associated
Press.) — Ten per cent. of the children
born in Prussia in wartime are
illegitimate, according to statements
made in the Prussian House of Repre-
sentatives in the debate on the vital
statistics. The Berlin Town Councillor,
Dr. Engel, in an article in Vorwärts
makes the statement that the large
proportion of illegitimate children is
"evidence of the moral healthiness of
the German race." He adds, in the
course of an appeal for the withdrawal
of all distinctions between legitimate
and illegitimate children:

"Piddactical [sic] though it may seem,
this appears to represent a measure of the
moral decay of our people. They afford
evidence that, after all, the idea of the
sanctity of family life—an idea which
under the war with special emphasis bids
us command—has not yet penetrated the
masses."

The terrible fact, however, is that
only 13 out of every 1,000 illegitimate
children reach their nineteenth year as
compared with 512 in the case of
legitimate children. The death rate of
illegitimates is a convincing plea for the
improvement of the situation of un-
married mothers and their children.
There should be a uniform birth certi-
ficate, and women who were engaged to
fallen soldiers should be awarded the
title "maid."
