sentimentalisms? On what
could the Kennett Bayners, &
the members of the press expend
their eloquence?

If we press Mrs Miller & her
steamboat, Mr Douglass & his wife
into the compass of a syllogism,
& prove logically that "United
States citizens" have a right
to choose their own wives &
employments, half the writing &
speaking in this country [as to class privileges] 
might be ended.  I hail
the day when in the discipline
of humane rights exact & equal
justice will be demanded for all
without distinction of race or sex.

With my kind regards to your
wife, & my best wishes for
your happiness,

very sincerely yours
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
