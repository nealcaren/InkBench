with enthusiasm. they have been much
appreciated - more than you can know.
I am longing to hear who is going to
Rome, how and when. I am as ignorant
as a mild [?] and I am beginning
to worry lest the mail I need reaches
Panama after I have gone. You have
been the best correspondent for your
letters are always a way where when I arrive.
I learn that mail's not carried by
this boat to N. Y but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you will
get this soon. It is not for the Panama.
Please accept my collective letter
as one for you. I must go to dress now.
I sent it to Maudie. She will decline & be
in office. Lovingly indeed!
