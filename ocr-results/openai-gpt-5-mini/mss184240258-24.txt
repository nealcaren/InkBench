My Dear Miss Dickinson;

Your valued note of the 6th
inst was duly received.

I have expressed your thanks
to Mr Brown for the Indianapolis Journal
reference & to Mr Bryson for the more
extended notice of your address in our
Logansport Journal.

Mother, my brothers are well
and join me in expressing our high
regard & consideration for you and
yours.

I was yesterday at Indian-
apolis where we held a moderate demon-
stration â€” We hope some of your friends
will have to regret Indiana after Nov 6.

I have noted the influence
& impression you have made where
you have been since leaving here
and feel confident that your
efforts will not be without advantage
in Indiana as well as much of New
York.

Very Respectfully Yours
W. F. Wilson
