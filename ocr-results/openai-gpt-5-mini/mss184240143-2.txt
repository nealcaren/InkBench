My Dear Mr Dickinson

I am afraid your business
affairs are again suffering. you have
not the party calculated to carry
most weight. "Nice a man as ever lived"
but "can't keep a Hotel". I am sorry, I
think poor I misapprehended your "bro's"
not John McCauley it might have
been now in a different position â€”

You told me you would see me about
your theatrical business & the next I hear
you have "a boy" (as it turns) dabbling
with your affairs & "mixing those children
up" I thought you had a clear experience
before with "vacation manager" & had
learned by experience the value of management.
Don't think I am scolding you only that I
feel slighted. I cared so more for you than any
man in this business or out of it for that
matter I would (or will) have done it cheerfully.
