3.. There are two indexes attached to the book—one of names, the other of subjects; every order will be indexed in the latter, immediately after being copied.

For names, a detached index will first be used, until the record book is full, when they will be arranged under each letter, as in City Directories, and, thus classified, transferred to the first permanent index attached to the record book. Every proper name will be indexed; and a red line be drawn in the body of the order under it, to facilitate a reference to it.

For subjects, the method of indexing, prescribed for the letter book, will be followed. The remarks made, relative to the mode of indexing the subjects of letters are also applicable to general and special orders.

4.. At Department Headquarters, the index of subjects, at the end of every year, will be arranged in alphabetical order, and, thus classified, a copy (printed or written, at the discretion of the officer in charge) will be transmitted to the Headquarters of the Army and the Adjutant General's Office for file, with the copies of the orders themselves.

5.. Copies of orders furnished as prescribed by paragraph 448, Revised Army Regulations of 1861, will not be endorsed.
