just note which I will endorse; and
secure its payment by a Mortgage on farm
stock, implements & household furniture.
The stock consists of four or five horses, two
yr Aldermy milch cows, a prize Aldermy
bull, 3 pigs, 1 family carriage, farm
wagon &c.; — the furniture full & in
good condition. Farming implements
all required upon such a place.
The farm is offered at private sale for
£1500 & we feel sure will be sold
soon after spring opens, as it is worth
considerably more money.
They would not allow one to take this
farm of ours for $500 a year for the absolute certainty
of the security — these offers — no would
I do it at all, but for this emergency
of their situation. Should the place
be offered at Hertford sale, it would
ruin the sale privately, as you will
see at a glance.
Can you help them, will this home fetch
such rent? If you can & will so
inform me, I will have the necessary
papers prepared & stake them & join
any day you may name.
I feel, Mr Douglas, that
while our claim upon you is nothing
beyond your regard for their mother,
pleading, is unnecessary. If you
can do it, we will be deeply grateful
& you will be secure in relieving them.
Please write me as early as possible
in enclosed envelope.

Very truly yours
John Searcy
