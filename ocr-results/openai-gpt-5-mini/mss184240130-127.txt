so many little things I cant
more—Mr Pettitt left an order
at Danny's yesterday & I've not
seen the things yet—I now must
rush & try to get at my trunk after
dinner. Best wishes to Mrs Ann[?]
& Ellen's heart to her dear
& golden heart. I've not written
one tenth of those who sent me Xmas
good wishes—have been too weak
