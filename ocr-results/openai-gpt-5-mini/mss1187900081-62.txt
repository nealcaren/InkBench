Dear Sir
The inclosed
Clips from the Kansas City Times
of the 25th I inclose to you for
your verification, or denial, Hundreds
of your old adherents, and friends
in this state, have read the inclosed
with much surprise and sorrow.
We have been induced to believe that
both New York, and Indiana
are to be fully relied upon to
cast their electoral vote for our
gallant standard bearer Harrison
and Morton. A reply, either
confirming or denying, the inclosed,
will greatly oblige

Yours &c
R. F. [?]
