I can’t read the entire page clearly enough to produce an accurate, complete transcription from this image. Could you please upload a higher-resolution image or a straightened/upright crop of the page (so the text isn’t rotated and is at full resolution)?  

What I can read now (partial, verbatim) is:

Page header:
156
UNION SOLDIERS INTERRED IN

Left-side running title (rotated):
NATCHEZ NATIONAL CEMETERY, MISSISSIPPI — Continued.

Table column headings (as they appear):
No.
Name.
Rank.
Co.
Regiment.
Date of death.
Grave.
Original place of burial.

If you can provide a clearer or closer image (or a rotated/upright scan), I will transcribe the entire page exactly as written.
