By the Militia Law the Governor is required to furnish the
troops with suitable clothing, and make arrangements with
the Government of the Confederate States to receive the
commutation money for the clothing furnished. This law
was ratified 20th September, 1861. Immediate steps were
taken to comply with the law, and although there was no
clothing on hand at its passage, before cold weather most of
the troops were supplied with clothing and blankets, at least
so far as to prevent any suffering.

An establishment for the manufacture of clothing was put
in operation in this city, immediately after the passage of
the law, under Captain Garrett, Assistant Quarter Master. I
enclose herewith a statement, marked "A," of the clothing
and camp and garrison equipage manufactured at that establishment
and turned over in the fiscal year ending September 30th.

Independent of the articles manufactured here, many purchases
had to be made elsewhere to supply the troops. I enclose herewith
a statement, marked "B," of the clothing and camp and garrison
equipage issued by Major W. W. Pierce, Quarter Master, for the year
ending September 30th.

The cost of every article of clothing has increased at such
rapid rates within the last few months, that they are now
more than double the price they were twelve months ago.
