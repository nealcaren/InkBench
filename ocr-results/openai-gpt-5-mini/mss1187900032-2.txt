Suppose we all went to the woods
to skate and skater until 1/2 past
eight when I came on and
am sitting down to drop a few
lines home they all have condemned
me for not bringing my skates
with me and if it is convenient
I wish that you would have them
sent with my other things so I must
cut this letter short as it is almost
bedtime and we must be up
at five o'clock. I should like to
hear from home once in a while
and you shall hear from me.
I know this is not as good
writing as you would have
but I am in haste so good
night

From your affectionate
son Charles R. Douglass
