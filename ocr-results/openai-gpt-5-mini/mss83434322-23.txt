RECONSTRUCTION:

A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE L. STEARNS.

Elmer, Salem Co., N. J.,
Feb. 27, 1865.

George L. Stearns, Esq., Boston, Mass.

Sir,— I lately received from you two communications, in which you advance certain propositions, and ask my influence and support for them.

1st. To organize the anti-slavery men of the country.

2d. To bring their combined influence to bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the social and political institutions of the Rebel States, and to remodel our financial system, in order to correct abuses growing out of slavery.

3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew, of Massachusetts, a seat in the Cabinet at Washington, as an able and faithful exponent of anti-slavery principles and measures.

I reply— I am not acquainted with the peculiar abuses of our "financial system" growing out of slavery, nor aware that some other champion of freedom might not be as proper a candidate for a seat in the Cabinet as Gov. Andrew, though I think he would be useful in that position; but if I can be of any service in an organization whose object is, after the Rebellion explodes, to reconstruct the Rebel States, and re-unite them upon the basis of liberty and equal rights, you can put my name down upon your anti-slavery record.

That you may not mistake, I will state a few fundamental propositions which I hold indispensable to that end.

1st. The UNITY AND ESSENTIAL EQUALITY OF THE HUMAN RACE. God is "OUR FATHER." All men are brothers, and the distinction between a man and a beast is infinite.

2d. EQUALITY OF RIGHTS. All human beings have an equal right—1st, to life and liberty; 2d, the development and culture of body, mind, and moral nature. The Government should secure these to the State, because its health, wealth, prosperity and highest happiness depend upon the fullest possession and enjoyment of them. 3d, the right to property in the common elements of nature,—light, air, water, and the land. The right to these elements is inalienable, because they constitute the elements of the human body, which could not for a moment exist without them, and because God created them for the maintenance, in every age, of all the living. They are a common gift, which no man has a right to monopolize, and which the governing power is bound to secure to each citizen who needs them, or who desires them.

3d. RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT. Government is responsible for the equal protection and faithful promotion of the highest well-being of each individual within its domain.

4th. MONOPOLIES. The State is bound by legislative obligations only so far as these were necessary to its life and well-being. No existing generation can, by its legislation, bind the next generation to measures deemed hostile to the public life, health and happiness.

5th. THE FRANCHISE. On this subject I offer an instructive statement before I give the principle.

In New Jersey the ballot-box is, in effect, sometimes set up openly for sale to the highest bidder, and so many bought votes taken at the polls that the unbought ones are deemed of little value to the candidates. I have heard voters declare, here in Salem County, that the only benefit they could see in the franchise to the poor man, is the money he gets for his vote. To be sure, these were foreigners. I never heard a native say this, though many sell their votes. The abuse is so great that some respectable voters excuse themselves from voting as being useless. But ask those gentlemen with the bribe money in their pockets what objection they have to a negro vote, and nearly every man will roll up his eyes and lift his hands in holy horror, as if you were covered all over with leprosy, or had just committed the unpardonable sin. Now I am not addressing these men. To reason with them would be ridiculous. But every anti-slavery man and political reformer will at once comprehend the justice and humanity of the following proposition.

PURITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE BALLOT BOX.

"First pure." (Bible.) A corrupt use of the ballot-box is not Democracy, but an aristocracy (money rule) of the most odious kind. The purity therefore of the franchise should be guarded by the severest penalties. Heavy fines, to go to informer on conviction of the offender, with imprisonment at hard labor, and partial loss of franchise for the first offence, and total loss for the second, would probably accomplish that end.

Purify, then, the election,—withdraw all sinister motives to a corrupt vote. Make the vote the simple expression of the uncorrupted sense and will of the voter, and open the franchise to every adult and human being. Mind rules the universe. Give it an open field and fair play, and let the national will, protected from sinister motives, and guided by the national intelligence, create and maintain the national institutions.

The third clause of my second proposition—"the right to property in the common elements"—is so important that I beg, in conclusion, to make a few remarks upon it.

You will find the security of this right indispensable to the reconstruction of our southern communities. Immense landed estates in a few hands (baronies) the world over, are a death to Democracy. If three or four men own a whole country, they will be its governors. Its road system, school system, court, judges, officers, municipality and franchise, will all be controlled by them. They can and will, even under republican forms, secure their own election to the highest seats in the state and national councils, and become there, as in former years, an element of jarring and perpetual discord.

The landed estates, therefore, of all the prominent and active rebels, the great chiefs, should be confiscated and broken up. After these criminals are executed or transported, it might be safe to confer upon such heirs as remain in the country, and should take the oath of allegiance, so much land as would constitute a moderate homestead, while an equal homestead should be apportioned to each colored family. These, in fact, have the first and highest right, since the clearing and improvements have been done mainly by their labor. The soldiers, also, should receive bounties from it, and any left could be sold in limited quantities to loyal men.

In a conference held by Secretary Stanton and General Sherman with the colored people of Savannah, soon after that city was taken, the chosen spokesman of the negroes was Garrison Frazier. On being asked, "How can your people take care of themselves?" he replied: "The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn and till it by our own labor." All this man's replies to the Secretary and General were marked by uncommon shrewdness and good sense, but excelled. How has he a country who has got no home? Who habitually sells himself to somebody for a day or week to get bread for his family?

If, then, you wish to uproot slavery, break up land monopoly. Twin strands of one rope, slavery in some form will ever feed its insatiate maw upon stolen industry, so long as land monopoly shall be allowed to exist. The new freedom of the south, under the old land monopoly will be worse to the feeble and decrepit than their former slavery. Stung with poverty and desolation caused by the rebellion, the barbarous land-barons, with blind rage and malignant hate will vent their spleen on the innocent and helpless freedman, and, charging him with being the cause of their ruin, with an oppression unknown to former times of successful slavery, will grind him to powder. God help the poor ignorant negroes, who without any home, or legal claim to the elements of life, shall be compelled, day by day, to offer his labor to such masters in order to get bread for his wife and children! No, the government that shall permit land monopoly to wield its blighting curse over four millions of ignorant and helpless blacks will be false to its highest obligations, and an absolute despotism to the black race, to be again engulfed, at some future period, in its own blood.

If you anti-slavery gentlemen who are forming an organization to reconstruct the rebel States, should be wanting in intelligence to comprehend the magnitude of this great land question, let me admonish you that you are not qualified for the duty you have undertaken. I make this remark because the idea is not embraced in your printed communications.

In this letter I send you my political daguerreotype,—Democratic and Republican in every feature. If you conclude it will not disgrace your anti-slavery gallery, you will hang it up there among the rest.
