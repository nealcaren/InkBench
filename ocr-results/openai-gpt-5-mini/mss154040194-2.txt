Dear Mrs Chapman Catt,

We took in our programme of this year
to read lectures on "Famous Women".  Mrs Reus Ianculescu and
I will do it, she in the L.D.D.F. and I in popular evening courses.
But as there are no complete libraries in Roumania and not
a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know
the titles of the books necessary for preparation.  We rather therefore
be you ask to the other sections of I.W.S.A. to ask your help.

Feeling so much the lack of a poor library we will
try at one time with our studies, to found one at B. and
perhaps than will we be able to assemble round it the
women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time.
Would your association be able for the generous act of some
help into sisters and to send us one of the other standard works
on women movement in your country and specially
books, there we could find biographies of your famous women?
We would mean in a first serie of lectures on political and social
procurement of women and in a second that the portraits of "Women
in Art and Science".  But we know so little, it is to say not much
