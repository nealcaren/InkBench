IN THE LAND O' COTTON

President Warmly Received
in Georgia Today.

VISITED MOTHER'S HOME

ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROS-
WELL AND ATLANTA.

Many Tender Recollections of His
Early Childhood Awakened by
Visit to the Old Homestead.

ROSWELL, Ga., October 20. -- President
Roosevelt today carried out his long-cher-
ished plan of visiting the home of his
mother -- Roswell, Ga. One of his reasons
for coming south was that he might see the
old homestead where his mother spent her
girlhood and which she left a happy bride.
That the visit was fraught with many ten-
der recollections was evident, and as his
carriage drove away from the old Bulloch
mansion, where his mother lived and mar-
ried, the President murmured to Mrs. Roose-
velt: "I can hardly bear to leave here."

The President reached Roswell at 7:30
o'clock this morning, and was joined here
by Senator and Mrs. Clay, who were his
guests at breakfast. He then entered a car-
riage and was driven to the mansion. This
old homestead is now the property of
J. D. Wing, a lumber merchant of this sec-
tion, who lives in it with his sister, Mrs.
Wood, the postmaster of Roswell.

Here he was greeted by two old servants
who lived on the place during his mother's
young womanhood. One of these is "Aunt
Grace," who acted as maid to Miss Martha
Bulloch, who afterward became Mrs. Theo-
dore Roosevelt, and the other is William
Jackson, who decorated the mansion on the
occasion of the marriage of its young mis-
tress.

The President was deeply touched as he
shook the hands of these old servants. In
company with Mrs. Roosevelt he then in-
spected the house, calling to the attention
of the company many incidents connected
with his mother's childhood. Before leaving
the mansion he posed with Mrs. Roosevelt
for a picture which included "Aunt Grace"
and "Daddy William."

Address in the Town Park.

From the homestead the President was
driven to the town park, where a stand had
been erected, from which he delivered an ad-
dress. He was welcomed to Roswell by
Charles M. Reed, a student of Mercer Uni-
versity, who in the course of a well-chosen
address said the only reason he could see
for the selection of himself to deliver this
welcome was because of the President's
well-known fondness for having young men
identified with public affairs. Senator A. S.
Clay introduced the President, who was en-
thusiastically greeted as he arose to speak.
He said:

"Senator and you, my friends, whom it
is hard for me not to call my neighbors,
for I feel as if you were; you can have no
idea of how much it means to me to come
back to Roswell, to the home of my mother
and my mother's people, and to see the spot
upon which I already know so well from
what my mother and my aunts told me.
It has been exactly as I was told when vis-
iting some old place of my childhood. It
has meant very much to me to be intro-
duced by Senator Clay, for Senator Clay has
been associated with me in many ways and
knows the facts about us."

Clay and Cockrell.

"If the average man I had to deal with
in public life possessed Senator Clay's firm
devotion to what he deems right my task
would be so easy that it would not be worth
mentioning. I have gone to Senator Clay
for advice and counsel and help ever since
I have been in Washington, just as I went
to Senator Cockrell of Missouri while he
was in the Senate, with the certainty that
all I had to do was to convince him that
what I wanted done was right -- I could not
always convince him, but if I did convince
him that was the end of it."

"On my friends, I hardly like to say any-
thing about my feelings, but my heart is
moved by coming back here among you.
Among the earliest recollections I have as a
child is hearing from my mother's and my
aunt, Miss Annie Bulloch, of the part that
Roswell and Bullochs came in the history
of the family and of the home. I looked for-
ward to this visit for a long time and I am
deeply grateful for the cordial reception
which has been given me."
