My future Dear Sweetheart of mine -
We all admire you - I excuse - and
love your parts - and we are so glad
that you had such good news - Now
why do you get this letter June week &
If Mrs. Hill will merely hand cleanse
Mr. Gorton, which prepared here and
which he prepared - is requiring very hard
work - you remember how - to be prepared
1/2 rooms - into a useful modern
place for the younger people to live
and grow up - Just trying to
find a people of the poor of day
who might want to help us do
it. I am having some success
with F. L. - Students - of two levels
here, and Mr. Warren are our list
would certainly be a great joy to
them and every one - pleased
to think of doing something in
his desire - It would be truly -
with my good wishes.
