I know a good wheeze when
I hear it!!!  I wont take
his pension when I'm about,
surely I prefer mine when I
have the same chance to judge
as he.

- I dont know what you
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter from my western
friend but I include a
copy -

Good-bye
again
with heartiest
wishes for your health
specially if you think of
facing the vigor of a
New England summer next
July -
