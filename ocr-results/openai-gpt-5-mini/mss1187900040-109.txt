But its really seems - that
I am never - allowed to have
what I wish for. -
Everything seems against
me - I wonder if some
of us are really destined
to suffer - Perhaps it is
the Almighty means of
softening the heart - and
of teaching us those
sympathies - Oh - if so - Oh
it is better to be afflicted
for - it is terrible to be
indifferent to the sorrow
of other fellow creatures
& to produce by sad experience
what it is to be ill-treated
by those - upon whom we lean
for time ever smiles -
I have hard hearted they
are - Their coldness is hard
to bear - than the former whose
treachery breaks the heart -
