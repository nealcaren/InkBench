pursue, and I trust I shall
have your approval as well as
that of friend Bassett.

Mr. Blaine has been sick in New
York for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get well. There
is much interest manifested in
his condition.

I thank you for the long and very

With my kindest regards,
Yours truly,
F. W. Fothune
