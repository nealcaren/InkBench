"When I first saw the light of day on this planet, it seemed as
if I had been rudely awakened from a death like sleep.  How well
I remember the conversation between the doctor and my father as
they handed me over to the nurse.

"I remember looking back at my mother's face at that moment.
The look of pain and anguish on it was burnt into my plastic brain,
and often during my babyhood I would watch as she suckled me.

"Somehow she was impelled to talk to me, not as a child, but as
her own heart, pouring out all her woman's desires, and bemoaning
her failures.

"I remember well how the silent prayers, when her lips were
moving would stir my heart; and as I look back over the years from
childhood to maturity, I realize that there was some subtle power
of transmutation at work, for somehow, from the very first moment
I seemed to know all the future without being able to give any
expression in words."

Victoria never had any doubt about being a woman of destiny.
In the same autobiographical sketch, written in 1895, in London,
with her active years far behind her, she told of a vision she had
seen in her childhood days and the message it gave her from the
occult world.

"I remember," she said, "one night when all was silent, the great
old fashioned fireplace was sending out over the room in which we,
my sisters and I were sleeping, a shadowy light.  Suddenly I saw
an enormous black and white dog enter the room, and walking to the
fireplace disappear, whilst I lay there wondering what it all meant.

"I was conscious of the presence of some living being near me.
In a moment a tall dark man said 'Come with me' and we went to
walk out in the open air.  When I looked up at his face, it was
radiant with divine wisdom.  He told me I should play a part in
ushering in the new order of things, which would be understood and
acted upon before the close of the 19th century."

Victoria was 14 years old when she contracted the first of her
three marriages.  Her first husband was Col. Canning Woodhull, a
physician, whom she used to accompany on his visits to patients.
She used to say that this experience roused in her a desire to
emancipate women from the shackles of ignorance and to make mater-
nity more intelligent.

After the birth of a second child she divorced Woodhull, and
with her younger sister, Tennie, began the study of law in her
father's office.

At 32 Victoria took her second husband, James K. Blood, and soon
became nationally known as a crusader.

Her views which would hardly startle the world now, were shock-
ing in a day when women were considered inferior to men, and were
expected never to appear on the street except under male protec-
tion.  Once Victoria violating a rule, appeared at Belmontico's
without an escort.  When told she could not be served, she went
out and brought in her cab driver.

Various motives were given for her appearance in Wall street.
It has been said that she wanted to open the avenues of business to
women, and demonstrate that her sex was as competent as the male.
Another version is that she wanted to reveal from first-hand expe-
rience the corruption in the business world under male domination.
Still another explanation is that she wanted to raise money for
her Presidential campaign.

Anyway the innovation upset the city of New York.  Reporters
camped on the trail of Victoria and Tennie.  Crowds of the curious
flocked to the office of Woodhull, Claflin & Co.  "The lady brokers,"
were the sensation of the hour.  Soon, it was noised about that
they had the financial backing of Commodore Vanderbilt.

Fourteen months after she entered business, Victoria made her
dash into public life.

She prepared a memorial, an argument for votes for women and
presented it to both houses of Congress.  The House referred it
to the Judiciary Committee and ordered it printed.  Victoria's
contention was that by the 14th and 15th Amendments, women were
citizens and had the right to vote.

On January 12, 1861, she argued her case with great eloquence
before one Judiciary Committee of the House.  She was the first
woman to address Congress.  She made women suffrage a burning
issue, forced it upon the attention of the country.  Ben Butler
was one of those she converted.  He championed her cause.

Thence forward, Victoria became the militant leader in the suf-
frage fight.  In the election of 1871, in New York city, with her
sister and others, she went to an election booth and insisted that
she be allowed to vote.  Her militancy brought her into conflict
with Tammany and the police.

In 1872, the so-called Equal Rights party held a convention
in New York attended by 500 delegates from 26 States and Four Ter-
ritories.  The convention nominated Victoria for President of
the United States amid great enthusiasm.  She drafted the plat-
form which called for limiting a President to a single term, re-
form in the Civil Service, an eight-hour day for labor, and prison
reform.

Her campaign collapsed, and was soon overshadowed by the events
which carried Victoria and Tennie into jail and the law courts.

The sisters had started their magazine, Woodhull and Claflin's
weekly.  From the beginning it was sensational.  Its circulation
jumped rapidly.

Stung by opposition, the crusading sisters had undertaken to
expose hypocrisy.

The story about Henry Ward Beecher had been circulated by the
gossips for some time.

In her lectures Victoria Woodhull had been discussing sex with
great frankness.  "The Human Body, the Temple of God," was the
title of one of her lectures.  She was bitterly attacked by the
guardians of morality.  At one time hotels were closed to her.
She and her sister had difficulty in finding a place to live.
Finally she went with her husband, Blood, to occupy a house in the
Murray Hill section of New York.

While she was there she was arrested for the publication of the
Beecher story.

She had fought several times to enlighten the public on this
matter.

She had given her story to reporters, and repeated it in Boston
at a national convention of Spiritualists, which elected her presi-
dent.  But the daily press would not print it.  So in her magazine
Victoria screamed all the louder about "Sunday School morality
and pulpit pharisees."
