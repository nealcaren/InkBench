NEW ENGLAND PORTRAITS
ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

The Literary Digest for July 2, 1921 59

An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the
name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League
of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone,
a pioneer of woman's rights. Her father, Henry B. Blackwell,
was an abolitionist and practically the only man who really de-
voted his life to obtaining equal rights for women. One of Miss
Blackwell's aunts, Elizabeth Blackwell, was the first woman to
take a medical degree, and another, Antoinette Brown Black-
well, was the first woman to be ordained a minister. Miss Black-
well was graduated from Boston University in 1881, and then
joined her parents in working for suffrage and in publishing the
Woman's Journal, carrying the paper on alone after their death
until 1917 when it became the Woman Citizen. For many
years she appeared annually before the committee of the Massa-
chusetts Legislature to answer the anti-suffrage arguments,
and a distinguished lawyer once said he considered her rebut-
tals the ablest presentations of controversial matter he had ever
heard. It was also Miss Blackwell who brought together the
two parties of the suffrage movement, whose estrangement
weakened their effectiveness, welding them in 1890 into the Na-
tional American Woman's Suffrage Association, of which she
was secretary for nearly 20 years. For years she has been a
trustee of Boston University and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
Close to her heart is the cause of the Armenians. She has ren-
dered into English a volume of Armenian poems, as well as one
of Russian poems, a volume of Yiddish verse, and one, still un-
published, of Mexican and South American poetry. Her biogra-
phy of Catherine Breshkovsky, "The Little Grandmother of the
Russian Revolution," was at one time one of the "six best
sellers."
