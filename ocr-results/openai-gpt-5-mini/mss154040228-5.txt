Dictated                                 11-20-'31

My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am in the General Hospital, Osteopathic
Unit #780 - at Los Angeles, at the
present with a fractured leg;
I have been here 8 weeks today.
Hope soon to be released from
this terrible house of torture, a
cast, so that I can return
to my little apartment at
609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena
Calif.  Many friends are wonderful
to me in so many ways.

Address my close friend Mrs. Lois Jewtkils 1718
Oak St., So. Pasadena - who has
all [?] of me in charge.

Cordially
Henrietta G Moore
