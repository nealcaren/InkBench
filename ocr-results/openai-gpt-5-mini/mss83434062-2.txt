fired upon to draw me into the street at
midnight to murder me and my officers
saying if we got into the office it will not
take long to fix the niggers and note she
must furnish evidence that she knew what
was to convay my Regt to Charleston which
was accordingly done and repeated threats
to the effect that not one of them a-d nigger
officers should ever reach the coast - where then
and to this shot after I reached Newberry and
while getting my Regt into camp for the
night I was fired at the hall passing near
my head a few moments after which I was told
by a colored man of the town not to leave the
camp that night without a strong guard with me
as he heard the men who had fired the shot
say that they intended to kill the col of what
a-d a-d nigger Regt before morning that they had
come on the train from Anderson to do it - and
when at two o'clock in the morning I was aroused
by the cry of murder in the camp which I soon
found to proceed from Foster Mills of Co C (who had
just been brought into camp from the R. R. depot
where he had been on guard with) his head
nearly severed from his body and as Dr B
informed me he could not live until sunrise
was it not natural for me to conclude that the
time had come for me to act - a few minutes
brought the murderer to camp who proved to be

one of Rebble Gen Morgan's men dressed in full
Confederate uniform and armed with a knife
such as no man but a murderer would carry
confessing that he had stalked the a-a nigger
and demanded of one whose I was going to do
about it - I quietly informed this high toned
gentleman that I should give him one hour to
prepare to meet his God and accordingly
at sunrise I released a firing party and
executed him after forming my Regt in line
upon which I woke up our march to Charleston
and it is a noticeable fact that no farther
outrages has since been committed upon
any member of the Regt - as soon as I got
to Charleston I asked for a court of inquiry
in the case which was granted and in
whose judgement I was exonerated from all
blame but Gov Perry having caused the
thing to was brought up and I was brought
before a court martial and a very honorable
acquittal by a verdict of Not Guilty - and
I am again on duty. One more pleasing
fact connected with the affair is that W. G.
Bennett was the President of the court
and that he stood by me like a Brother
through it all. I was not all surprised
when Gov Perry came out so strong against
me for what can a man expect from a
man occupying as he did at the time
the position of Gov of South Carolina and Baynard
