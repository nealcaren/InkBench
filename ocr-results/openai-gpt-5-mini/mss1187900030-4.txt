department but have not received an answer yet. I expect one to night. It has been beautiful weather ever since you left and I do not think we will have much snow but it will be keen and sharp. Elizabeth is making preparations to read her lecture next Monday night and leave us on tuesday or wednesday of next week. I believe she has near made half of her ap- pointments yet - but I think today or to- morrow Denis will attend to it. I [?] wishing in the schoolroom and the few who have brought their dinners are as full of glee as possible. I hope you will have as com- fortable a time as possible and that you will not return home sick. Old Bloom will have to keep out of sight for a little while the Governor of Missouri has a reward of $5,000 offered for his capture and Daniel [?] has given himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love and enclosed you will find a note from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie will send a few lines.

Your affec. daughter
