and proceeded to bury the bodies as best we could.  As we groped our way in the darkness, sometimes we could hardly distinguish a dead soldier from a section of a corn row, and would have to determine the matter by feeling with our hands.  When we found a body we would as quietly as possible dig a hole beside it, roll the body into the hole or grave, and then cover it over.  As we went on with the work we came to a spot where four or five men had come together and died.  They lay with their heads close together, and their bodies extending outward from the common center.  Evidently they had crawled together before death came, and probably talking of their friends and homes, had died.

Decomposition had taken place in all the bodies, and the labor of burying them was most disagreeable and trying.  My thoughts as I proceeded with the work were of a character that can never be described.  Who the dead men were we were burying we knew not.  Some of them might have been my neighbors at home.  But that was no place for speculation, nor for indulging in sentiment.  Our work was urgent, and we proceeded with it as rapidly as we could, until the last corpse we could find was covered from sight.  And this work was done within less than a hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's breast-works.  John E. Barr, of Brookville, serving in the 105th Penna. regiment, was in this charge that was made through the corn field.

On June 20th or 21st our colored troops were put into the front line of works, and we held them until July 29th, when we were relieved to take part in the operations connected with the explosion of the mine on July 30th.  We occupied the front line of works six weeks, at the point where the rifle pits crossed the road leading from City Point to Petersburg.  During all that time we would spend three days in the front works, and then three days back in camp, alternating thus regularly.  There was scarcely a day when we were in the pits that we did not have at least one man killed or wounded.  Some days they would number two or three.  The work became very monotonous, and almost any sort of a change would have been hailed as a relief.  At times we dared not put our heads above the breastworks, or we would be shot at.  We had to go to the sinks after night, or take our chance in a fusilade of Confederate bullets.  The sinks near our place in the line were in a little piece of woods, surrounded by a growth of saplings and small trees.  These trees bore the marks of hundreds of bullets shot at men who were forced to visit the sinks in the day time.

On leaving the rifle pits we were always relieved about sundown.  Our whole regiment would always go in and out of the works together.  Going out we would form at a point where our breastworks were high enough to protect us from the enemy's fire, and we had no fear of
