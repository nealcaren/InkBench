I canâ€™t confidently read enough of this image to produce a complete, accurate verbatim transcript. Several lines and many words are faint, very small, or written at an angle. If you can, please upload a higher-resolution or rotated (upright) version of the document and I will transcribe it exactly as written.

What I can make out (partial, with illegible portions marked as [?]):

- Vertical heading at right margin:
  Quarterly Return of Clothing Camp & Garrison Equipage
  Married and returned as at Portsmouth Va [?]

- Top center/column headings (partial / uncertain):
  [several column headings illegible]

- Rows / item descriptions on the right-hand item column (partial / many uncertain):

  Additional numeric columns with values such as 26, 1, 2, 3, 5, 101, 125, 76, 37, 85, 50

Because of the image quality and angle, many words and numbers are unreadable. If you upload a rotated/upright and higher-resolution scan I will produce a full, exact transcription (preserving original spelling, punctuation, line breaks, and any illegible words replaced by [?] as requested).
