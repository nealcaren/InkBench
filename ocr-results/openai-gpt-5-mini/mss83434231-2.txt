CIRCULAR,
No. 3.

Whereas a large amount of land in the State of Virginia, and in
other States that have been in insurrection, has been abandoned by
disloyal owners and is now being cultivated by Freedmen; and whereas
the owners of such lands are attempting to obtain possession of them,
and thus deprive the Freedmen of the fruits of their industry: It is
ordered that all abandoned lands in said States now under cultivation
by the Freedmen be retained in their possession until the crops now
growing shall be secured for their benefit, unless full and just
compensation be made for their labor and its products, and for
expenditures.

The above order will not be so construed as to relieve disloyal
persons from the consequences of their disloyalty; and the application
for the restoration of their lands, by this class of persons, will in no
case be entertained by any military authority.

O. O. HOWARD, Major General,
Commissioner Bureau of Freedmen, Refugees, and Abandoned Lands.
