My dear daughter. - Miss Mack came yesterday and brought the box and visited with me awhile. She said she had a nice trip up and working at home and clearing away weeds in the back and the like.

We were very glad to talk with you Sunday-night. It helps Parks, feel better; we are doing very well at present. Brother and family are quite well. he doesn't come so often now, is still work-
ing out at Jackson, and help is getting welfare I hope you are well and wont over work be-
fore you comes home.

now that School is out I suppose some of the children will be over to stay.
much love from Mother
