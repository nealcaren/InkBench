Oct. 8, 1957.

My Dear Daughter, - I hope you are still getting along alright. we are well, Parks is still on the job. and keeping the house to summer time heat, despite the nice bright weather we are having.

Brother and part of the family was here last night. They brought Mrs Cotton over to church and waited here while she was in service.

Daisy was not feeling well. she had been to the Doctor earlier during the day. He gave her a shot. and she says it left her feeling dizzy and sleepy. She did not look well at all. so I called to-day. said she was feeling better.

I am sending a letter that came to-day from Highlander. and one that came last week. so from to-day on I will forward them direct. write when you can.

much love from us to you. from mother
Leona.
