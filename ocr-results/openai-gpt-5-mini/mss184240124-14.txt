Miss Anna E. Dickinson,

1065 Forest Ave., Bronx,

New York City

Dear Miss Dickinson:-

I am sorry it is impossible for me to answer in-
telligently the questions you ask, for the reason that I am not strict-
ly speaking a theatrical man, simply a business Manager.  I have, how-
ever, asked Mr. Lindsay Morrison, who is Manager of the Boston Theatre,
and a gentleman who is thoroughly posted in matters of this kind to
reply to your favor.

Thanking you for your kind wishes, I remain,
Very truly yours,

Henry D. Dupee
