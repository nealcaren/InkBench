My dear Mollie:-

I gave you the place for a
cable and none is here. We remain
another day but I suspect that progress
is in the direction of recovery and that you
have not cabled about it.

Mch 27. I was interrupted here and now since
all things are different and two days has passed
your cable has been received, and it was such
a relief to get it. I imagine you passing through
that discouraging stage when you think you
never will be well again and when life has
lost all its powers. Well keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. I am so glad
you are better. This world would be a
black old place without you dear Mollie.

I expected to mail you a note here
because I thought at 9 P.M. it was a good
cable post & it would be a good mail
station, but it seems many American
