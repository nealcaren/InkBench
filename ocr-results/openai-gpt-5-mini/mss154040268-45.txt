To the Speakers Bureau:

Those roses more sweet, beautiful, temper dispelling, but

Roses sind Verboten.

Keep your money lodged under the suit to vindicate my
character. Please don't dissolve my cause again.

I have a vile temper; growing viler every day which
shows what policies will do for a woman & 
is a daily comfort & tonicless the pleasantry of
the Speakers Bureau!
