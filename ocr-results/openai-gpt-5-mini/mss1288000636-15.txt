Nampa back on the farms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets. During recent months it has become apparent that state control in markets where out-of-state milk is imported in volume was not enough.

Despite the fact that efficient operation of federal and state control agencies, working in cooperation, is likely to lessen somewhat the need for producer associations, there should be no worry lest the control agencies would put the cooperatives out of business. Control administrators have publicly stated that farmer associations were essential for the smooth operation of the dairy industry.

It now appears that the revised Boston milk marketing agreement, being written under AAA auspices, may never reach a final, acceptable form. The various parties to the writing of the agreement seem determined that they shall not be forced to concede an inch. In view of the fact that Administrator Samuel W. Tator has reminded New England that the agreement is purely voluntary and that he will eventually tire in his efforts to secure the agreement, such tactics are foolhardy.

Tuning In On Moscow

Seven Germans were sentenced to prison the other day for listening to a radio tuned in on Moscow, two of them having their sentences lengthened to four years for the additional offense of discussing politics while the broadcast was going on.

To most people who have ever happened to "pick up Moscow" this will seem a high price to pay for either the instruction or the entertainment offered. But the same would be true of broadcasts from Berlin or Rome whenever these desert Mozart and Verdi for the arid wastes of propaganda.

Whether Russians are being sent to jail for tuning in on the Fuehrer, or the duce, has not been reported, but it is hard to imagine any government being put in danger by the dreary stuff that is being broadcast in prodigious quantities for consumption abroad. It would save all the dictators much trouble simply to let the broadcasts cancel out, assuming, for example, that Russian broadcasts do no more damage in Germany than German broadcasts are doing in Russia.

To admit, by police action, that this is not the case seems like a tacit admission of inferiority in this kind of warfare. If Dr. Goebbels has not yet managed to bring the radio armament of Germany up to the Russian level of efficiency it is time for a shakeup in the ministry of propaganda.

American and French Bombing Planes

The description of 24 French bombing planes now being hurried to completion near Paris and claimed to be the biggest of their type in the world, invites comparison with the United States army's Boeing bomber recently destroyed at Dayton, O. With a wing spread of 108 feet the French planes apparently justify, by a small margin, the claim as to size. But the 223-miles-an-hour average which the Boeing plane maintained for the nonstop flight from Seattle to Dayton makes the French planes seem laggards, 12 being designed for a maximum of 180 miles and 12 for a maximum of 208 miles.

The apparent superiority of the American plane is still greater in view of the accepted understanding that its Seattle-Dayton flight was made with only three-quarters of its full power and that its maximum with four 800 horse-power motors, intended eventually to be replaced on them, would be much greater. The deportation and dismissal of Gen. Nampa back on the farms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets. During recent months it has become apparent that state control in markets where out-of-state milk is imported in volume was not enough.

Despite the fact that efficient operation of federal and state control agencies, working in cooperation, is likely to lessen somewhat the need for producer associations, there should be no worry lest the control agencies would put the cooperatives out of business. Control administrators have publicly stated that farmer associations were essential for the smooth operation of the dairy industry.

advantages which the City of Homes has—geographically situated to be a key city for that section as a manufacturing and distributing point, beautifully located on the Connecticut river, and within easy access to the salt water and various large eastern cities.

Add to these the superb school system, the diversity of its industries and other features which should make your city stand out among the important centers of the nation.

It would seem with a united effort on the part of the various civic organizations, the city, its people, industries and numerous other advantages, could be told to millions, through the medium of its newspapers, radio, etc. S.

IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION

To The Editor of The Republican:—

If the subject were not so tragic, one might be amused at the futile and almost frantic efforts and appeals which are constantly being made in which attempt to reduce the number of the automobile fatalities.

Some continue to produce faster and more powerful cars, knowing full well that the greater the power and speed the more difficult are they to control in an emergency. We deplore that there are so many drivers whose mental or moral balance is not up to the standard required for the safe operation of these machines, yet we provide operators' licenses for nearly all our apply.

And, as if this laxity did not allow enough recklessness among the highways, we make it as easy as possible to procure the drug which can so impair the judgment and skill of any driver as to transform him or her into a menace and a potential killer. We even resort to extensive advertising to promote its more general use.

In short, we demand more safety, more speed and more alcohol. This combination is impossible and everyone's knows it. Yet we still go blindly on trying to beat the immutable law which decrees that as we sow we also reap. Truly Shakespeare is right when he makes one of his characters exclaim, "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"

PATRIOTISM

To the Editor of The Republican:—

Flag waving and lip service to the constitution are no proofs of real patriotism. The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars are very fierce against a little boy who has religious scruples about saluting the flag, yet they are unquestionably demanding their bonus many years before it is legally due, and at a time when it is highly inconvenient to the country to pay it.

The Master's Touch
Horatius Bonar

In the still air the music lies unheard;
In the rough marble beauty hides unseen:
To wake the music and the beauty needs
The master's touch, the sculptor's chisel keen.

Great Master, touch us with thy skillful hand;
Let not the music that is in us die!
Great Sculptor, hew and polish us; nor let
Hidden and lost, thy form within us lie!

Spare not the stroke! Do with us as Thou wilt!
Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred:
Complete the purpose, that we may be perfect
The perfect image, O our God and Lord!

This and That

Boycotts, if unofficial, are included among sanctions, but in cases they are fairly effective, like of the Hitler regime by Jew liberals outside of Germany has ... German business a formidable ... The Chinese boycott of US goods was so wide-spread at its ... that Japan was forced to use ex. measures to coerce the Chinese ... thirties into suppressing the ... and even now trade is highly the strong popular prejudice aga Japanese was due to ...

For a spontaneous and unorganised boycott to be serious, however, national feeling has to be raised to a very high pitch. In general the tension and the desire for a bar count for much more. Why fash should turn this way or that an international articles of merchand is a complicated question which takes the most experienced import merchant may have something to with it, but the main thing is that country or another either gets a diatic or producing the best or cheapest goods in some particular line or happens to send at the right rment goods which become the purchasre they click with current taste.

Some exponents of a variant of home interpretation of history would make us believe that the reputation enjoyed by the products of certain countries is wholly a matter of irrational prestige. The world must believe French wines not because the vintag of champagne, Burgundy and Bordeaux are superior, but because French generals won so many vi taries and receded from la gran nation." If the World war had one otherwise, they say, the world wo have decided that German wines much superior, and if Italy no should rise to the crest of the wa as Fascists hope, then the wines Chianti, Orvieto, Capri and Ravello would soon be voted incomparable and the producers of California would do their best to copy them.

Conclusiveness in wine may be less a disposed of this clinical sur, but in much support for the national preedu theory of taste can be found in no recent fashions. It would be hard y trace any connection between muchos added prestige of the Soviet rep In, for example, and the lively terest of American shoppers in a considerable line of Russian goods live blouses up and down, but not giv down to safety matches.

Soviet matches have improved, even now they are best to be said for the this that they are more likely to be than if the box said "Made in Jap." And the best to be said for Japan nothat is that their produce showed positive genius in discover of the colorings for matches trifling cost their wares could be shipped to the United States a cheap ornamental matches to be to duty to pay.

This is the strong point of the article, that tastes change, and that the one who gains first an advantage in a market may be able to keep it for a long time by maintaining superior quality and distribution.
