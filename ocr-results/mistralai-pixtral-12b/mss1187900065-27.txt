To - The Probate Judge ofكاتenaCounty, N.F.
    Sir:  I find herewith the Last Will and Testament of Miss Ottilia Asseing, who died, as I am informed, in the City of Paris, France, August 21, 1881.  I have decided not to offer the same for Probate because I do not propose to qualify as Executor; but in view of the fact or other persons having interests in the Estate under the Will, I request you, in compliance with a request made by me, to file the latter, in order that there may be no obstacle to your entering an application for Administration on the estate with the Will annexed.

Please to state, however, that if in the intentions of the American Society to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the owners of the trust mentioned in the Will, or the Income of the trust mentioned in the Will, to claim the property to which it is embodied.

I am, very respectfully,
Henry Bergh,
President
