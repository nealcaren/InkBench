I write to announce to you both that in
one of the greatest difficulties about
this place, I am remarkable to keep up
with current events unless the pa-
pers are sent from home, and I
mine reading the daily papers very
much.

 Often that I have not put your
News to a very accessible [?] and that
you will favour me with rare early
reply I will close, with much love
I am,

   Yours aff. grand-daughter
