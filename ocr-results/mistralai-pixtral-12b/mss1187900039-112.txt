Dear Father

Yours of the 4th inst. is just received. I saw an account of one of your letters in the Meatly [New York Tribune] and thought that you might have other communications out hearing from you. All are well except the baby; his new Gord Aunt Robinson is attending him, or one about the will have the comfort but life not death with projets [projects] your send about the affair between Johnson, Boyd and my self. I know your mind and have is better understood. You may think the cause of the difficulty but believe you knew the truth, and it is hard to find it under the governments. I find once said that New York has gone against me. B clienting for another war. If you could do me any length [?] of train, I send underline again soon, so I am very busy just now. Let me send love of she knew I was writing. I have to better under all.

Yours affectionately,

Chas N. Atwood
