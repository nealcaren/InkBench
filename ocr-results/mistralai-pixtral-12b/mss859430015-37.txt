My dear daughter. - Miss
Mack came yesterday
and left me a few flowers and
visited with me awhile.
She said she had a nice
trip up and working in the fields
and clearing away
the weeds. We were very glad
to talk with your Sunday
better. Inc Park feels
well at present. Brother is
well, and family are quite
well. Nordine if working at
Jackson, and the wife; they
are mostly working and
help. I hope you are well
and feeling good and resting
from work. Be careful
now that school is out I
suppose some of the children
rent would be over to stay.
I don't want much that you
matter
