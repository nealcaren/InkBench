Dear Mr. Douglas,

I lately saw
speech delivered and its occasion
commemorated in your speeches
with great dignity.  It is so balsamic
and souls particularly satisfied
and pleased by your utterances,
and I am sure presented at the vision
truth of your power after
an almost continuous presence
oppression for nearly a half cen-
tury in the same slave suffering people.
