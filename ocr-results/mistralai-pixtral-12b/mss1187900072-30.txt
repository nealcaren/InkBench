Dear Father

Your letter dated March 24th received yesterday, it found us all well and pleased to hear from you.

Mr. Trotter, the new Recorder of Deeds is seriously pick with Pneumonia. Gerrit Boecken has been appointed Deputy Recorder of Deeds. The Democrats are much put out about it.

Senator Sherman is making a trip South in Georgia, a colored delegation called Arkisto
tal, and was refused admission, as soon as the door was opened, he paid his bill and went to another hotel. A colored woman by the name of Taylor from Kansas has been appointed to the Librarian Office. The political air looks at present on the Republican side in wavering between Blaine and Sherman. Congress has made an appropriation for a new Bridge across the Eastern Branch at the foot of Pennsylvania Ave. Business in the Recorder's Office is booming. Diswerved, the President of the Anacostia R.R. is married. McCandless has been appointed "Com-
missioner of Deeds." The President and Mr. Maclure have been taken back in the
prompt confirmation of Mr. Trotter. They expected he would be rejected. Sawyer
