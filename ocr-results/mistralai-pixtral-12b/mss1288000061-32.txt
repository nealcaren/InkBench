Business affairs are coming on very well indeed. I don't know what mix of business and
pleasure O. P. Allott is having, but it is paying your "dowry" for you with both
hands. I had one of my pleasantest days of the trip yesterday. We went on an
all-day excursion up the river, to Fitch's Bay. It was an early, breakfast, & then it
was Holbrooks [sic] came over, & we all piled into a little steam-launch, chartered
for the occasion. It carries 25, & there were 25 of us. The engine divides
it in the middle, with wood heaped up on each side (fancy a steam engine
running by wood!) & the back

Breeser to the Generals, & I think
you'll leave a good impression of
hearts & minds somewhere. I have

a letter of yours to dot to-day,
& shall read it this afternoon.
We stopped at Palisado Mamma, &

this way up to Fitch's Bay, where we
had a beautiful picnic. We dined

on the [?]-lawn at the shore, under
graceful canopies, and had atextit rider
ox card-party in the afternoon. It
was a lovely day, not too hot, a slight
breeze, and everything very happy.
I never enjoyed a day more since
I got to this country.
