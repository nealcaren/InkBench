Mr Fred Dunlap

Dear Sir,

Francis M Holley of

Weymouth Mass. 86 years of age kneels the following
offering for the Lincoln Monument Inauguration

"Father Abraham's Monument"

This Monument would seem to say
What Lincoln's dead but it's not so
In pride the spark of life of old.
For vain the blood he made to flow.
For vain the file attempt to kill.
In all our hearts his living space.
And while a drop of patient blood
Shall flow in any human frame.
it speaks as Memory of the good
the great and best Lincoln's Name.
This Monument we raise to thee
Great Chief whose mandates made us free
Our grateful tributes to Rev'd as send
For thee own true and constant friend

Also the following
Declaration to AmericanFlowers
The World is gazing on thee
Disprove thy robes with Cheer
And with thy precious powers
Adorn thy golden hair.

"Over"
