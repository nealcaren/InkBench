Undated   

My dear Miss Catt:   

The General Hospital Orthopedic Unit #750 - at Los Angeles, with whom present with a fractured leg; have been there since August today. I hope soon to be released from this terrible home of torture, a hell, so that I can return to my little apartment at 609 Thirteenth Street, San Francisco, Calif. Many friends are worried to know me in a hospital. I have my address only close friend Miss Rose Faulkhead, 1918 Oak Street, San Francisco - who has all of me in charge.   

Cordially
