I am never nearer, never dearer to thee
thou who art ever my guide, for verily there is
no stone respecter of persons. O may our
souls in this hour of worship offer to thee
so perfect, so pure an offering. O may we in
faith discern what God discerns, and love what
God loves.  O may we understand as God
understands¬—as God loves what God loves
— so as to obey, to do—He is better to be
afflicted for it is nighted in him, to lie
wide awake to the tana of duty before we
sleep.  O may we find amid the sorrows
and chevaly openness of humanity for thee
byAAA specimen of what true
faith means to love—O may we be no
longer avoiding nor distant from
thee—when we have been
torn from thee, as when life hath
burst hearted—O may we when temples
were folded, when yea, it was rolled
from the heart is upon in the
mind, that moment is before thee
as in close union with thee
thou who art ever before thee
when we die then we die
