# Transcription Guide

## Core Principles

### Transcribe What You See
- Preserve original spelling, grammar, and punctuation as written
- Do not paraphrase or correct errors
- Type what you see, not what you think it should say
- Transcribe text in the order it appears on the page (as you would read it aloud)

### When Not to Transcribe
- **Blank pages**: Check "Nothing to Transcribe" and save
- **Images only**: If a page contains only images and no text, click "Nothing to Transcribe"
- **Mass-produced content**: Skip pre-printed calendars, almanacs, and dates in diaries that don't aid historical discovery
- **Shorthand**: Insert [[shorthand]] instead of attempting to transcribe shorthand symbols

## Text Handling

### Basic Text
- Transcribe all legible text including letterheads, page numbers, and catalog numbers
- Read and transcribe columns in logical reading order
- Don't attempt to preserve formatting (bold, italic, underline, indentation)

### Abbreviations and Symbols
- Do not expand abbreviations - transcribe exactly as written
- Transcribe symbols as they appear (&, $, £, §, etc.)
- Use lowercase "s" for historical "long s" that looks like "f"

### Line and Page Breaks
- Preserve line breaks as they appear
- When words break across lines on the same page, write the complete word on the first line
- When words break across pages, transcribe the word on the first page
- For multiple pages in one image, transcribe all pages in order with empty lines between them

## Special Situations

### Illegible or Unclear Text
- Use [?] for completely illegible words
- For partially readable words, transcribe visible letters: s[????] for "s" followed by unreadable letters
- If you can't read much of a page, save and move to another document

### Text Modifications
- **Deletions**: Transcribe crossed-out text within square brackets [deleted text]
- **Insertions**: Include inserted text in natural reading order without special notation
- **Marginalia**: Transcribe margin notes within [* *], placed after relevant text or at the end if unrelated

### Punctuation and Special Cases
- Make best judgment for historical punctuation (en dash, em dash, etc.)
- Reduce excessive ellipses to three dots (...)
- Ignore bleed-through text (backward/mirror text from other side of thin paper)

## Document-Specific Guidelines

### Tables
- Preserve relationships between columns and rows
- Focus on capturing data accurately, not replicating exact layout
- Use spaces and line returns to maintain readability

### Newspapers
- Transcribe all articles, not just seemingly relevant ones
- Follow natural column reading order
- Don't attempt to preserve layout

### Envelopes
- Transcribe all legible text including postmarks and stamps
- Mark postmarks and stamps as marginalia [* *]

### Cross-Writing
- Transcribe layered text in natural reading order
- Add "cross-writing" tag when applicable

## Languages and Characters

### Non-English Text
- Transcribe completely in original language
- Use correct characters (Ç not C)
- Do not translate - transcribe only
- Use alt codes for special characters

## Quality Guidelines

### What to Avoid
- Don't describe images or non-text features in transcription
- Don't add formatting characters or layout symbols
- Don't guess at heavily damaged or illegible text
