PROSPECTUS.

The American nation, guirning in its origin like the fountain of aame vein with the golden stream of its navigational genius; touching with the tissue of the Good and Beautiful, wherever found and in whatever land. Civilization progresses westwards, yet it cannot be independent of its sources. As we avail ourselves of the scientific improvements of other ages, or as they were small and training influences of the past, in the present state of civilization, we should consider it proper in our progress to carry back some of the great thoughts and intellectual labours of those great minds of our predecessors, which have conferred glory on their native countries and on the world. Every truly great writer is invariably a cosmopolite, who thinks and listens for the whole world, and the universal opinion orientates that what has rendered a writer celebrated must continue to do so, when truly translated in other tongues. In German literature in rich in great and genial works, who well deserve to be made known to everyone in our own continent, who claims to be well educated or informed. German classic literature is more numerous than English, and needs not an apology for its existence in the old world, the middle-ages an incentive to earnest thoughts and action, and the young a guide to the enjoyment of the beautiful, to wit to which field every intellectual and physical sense is so keenly alive. Benefits pre-eminent in giving to books of the past and up to the present, a broader and loftier standpoint in the contemporary and the workers who have been still further assisted, by the representations of those integral in the literature, couched in instruction, of the necessity of such a undertaking. I have determined to give to the general public assisted by leading scholars, the works of the great writers of German, which shall be translated into American tongue. I cause to give to the general public, for the fourth month of this year, to be [distributed] in weekly issues. I have been publishing in my Volksbibliothek, or ‘Popular Library’, the works of these great writers. With this number, I begin the publication of what I believe to be a sacred trust, for five years, of the Direckter of the ‘Knecht’, or Travel by H recebeuhr accent.

CHARLES G. LELAND, Esq., the talented translator of the Pictures
of ‘Travel is already known to our literary public by his numerous contributions to Heritage. It is perfectly known, that every translation of literary works has its difficulties and to make the point of a potch, and to render it worthy in another tongue.

He manages as the founder of a new school of poetry, and as the most brilliant star in the firmament of living German writers, deserves the praise, in the first place. I am proud to say that he will retire Szaud, &c., and his publications, he is already considered by her public, both writer and publisher, will gladly continue their efforts by translating all the remaining works of his remarkable of modern times.

A single number of the Pictures of Travel includes about fifty in 16 mo. in large numbers, held at the extremely moderate price of twenty-five cents. I venture to speak confidently of the excellence of the work, as it is intended that its typographical execution and paper shall fully correspond to the literary merits of its contents.

All newspapers giving us early notice of a special nature, shall be favoured with an equal liberal discount to booksellers and agents. The prospectus and other advertisements relative to the work will be sent wherever requested.
