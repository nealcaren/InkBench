that after a battle of two hours they [the
"Northern forces"] were repulsed leaving
"many dead and wounded, and that order
and tranquillity reigned in the South.
"These have on the 19th a mail of the
18th from Portland, via Havana, a cable on
26th via Cuba and a mail again on the 26th
"once. - I continue to believe that the
"Northern forces will raise the siege and
"retreat to the North, complaining perhaps
"scession, and that the unfortunate state
"if things go on as they are. Be states
"too will act in concert with peace. This war would not have
"lasted. - I ask angels if that would not be
"heaven for me to go to port authorities with
"Mr. Douglass to beseech if the two parties contain-
"ing cannot arrive at an honorable understanding.
"Again, my dear Douglass, this letter is already so
"long that I must cut it short here.

Very sincerely a very cordially your
Mr. Bassett and Mrs.
