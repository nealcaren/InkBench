My dearutions:

On my passage here
NewYork yesterday from Phil'a, where I
spoke on Friday evening, I called at-Kum-
broke & Co's office for news about the sailing
of our steamer. And this is what the clerks
in the office assured me:

The steamer is the "Orange Nassau".
She said sail from Philadelphia (along
side of the Wall street ferry), Brooklyn,
on Friday next, 4th instant, at two; for
Port-au-Prince.

I presume that we can count our this
information as fairly reliable.

I have always understood that the
"Orange Nassau" is the fastest steamer of the
line. And she is a steamer in which we can stand
if for six days on board of
