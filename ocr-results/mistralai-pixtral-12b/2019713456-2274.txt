# OLIVER OPTIC'S MAGAZINE.

**THIRD YEAR! FIFTH VOLUME!**

*Partly because of the immense popularity which the only Juvenile Magazine published*

**ONCE A WEEK**

*has attained*, assures the publishers that

**OUR BOYS AND GIRLS,**

* Subscribed to as an experiment, was needed by the young people and is indorsed by their parents and guardians, who demand *

**A FIRST-CLASS PERIODICAL,**

*and are willing to pay a fair price for each, while they insist that it shall not only contain the productions of the*

**BEST AMERICAN WRITERS**

*who have distinguished themselves in the department of Juvenile Literature, but also that it shall be of the*

**HIGHEST MORAL TONE.**

* The publishers of OLIVER OPTIC, who have been encouraged by the support of the past, will endeavor in the coming volume, to use the privilege of their influence for a work more perfectly than ever before, and to use every legitimate means to make it the means of their Trade List more than

**TWO HUNDRED JUVENILE BOOKS,**

*written by the most popular authors, they are confident that their arrived facilities in this department will enable them in realizing their ambition to furnish*

**THE CHEAPEST AND THE BEST MAGAZINE**

*for the young people in the United States. Their aim will still be to*

**IMPROVE THE MIND AND HEART,**

**ART, SCIENCE AND LITERATURE,**

*and develop and encourage the truest morality. The publication will continue to be under the editorial supervision of OLIVER OPTIC, whose books for young people have now reached the marvelous annual sales of*

**ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND VOLUMES.**

* His works are in every family all over the land, and are largely relied upon by parents and guardians as precious educational agencies in the training of their children. *This popular author, while he writes so well and with such power and happy originality that his stories are Ã— popular by readers, and praised by the critics for their abounding good sense and seemingly purest moral tone, will still afford young readers no excuse for resorting to the dangerous trash so abundant at the present time. Men show their heroes and heroines with pure and noble characters, worthy the imitation of youth, and depicts villainy as easily and forcibly and with the same realism as he produces squalid guilt. The fascinating beauty of pure characters is made to charm, and the singular interest and impressiveness of the criminal world is condemned.*
