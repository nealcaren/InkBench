Dear Sir-

I am an ex Union Soldier and have endeavored to be a good - out and out Republican ever since the organization of that party.  I have resided in the south a greater portion of the time since the civil war and in my humble sphere in life have been a friend to the colored race.  It certainly seems to me that the curse of absolute Slavery is still rests upon this Country and fears heavily upon the colored race.  I arise at present in 1886
