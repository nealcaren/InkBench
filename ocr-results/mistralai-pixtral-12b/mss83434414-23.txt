## FREEDMEN'S BUREAU.

The friends of the freedman claim for him a weight of intellectual brain equal to his white fellow-man. A number of the medical officers interested in his cause saw, where opportunity offered, leaving columns concreted it baseless could identify himself as others, many interesting statistics will be added to the archives of the bureau.

The officers of the medical staff in charge of the districts are entitled to great credit for the care and efforts put forth. They ably, readily anticipated from me, removed many of the gentlemen during the weeks. The annual communication having reached only a few of the state departments of the bureau has relieved optimism and encouraged me in my official course.

In concluding this report I beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the facilities at all times afforded by the Commissoner to the medical branch of the bureau.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CALEB W. HORNOR
Surgeon United States Volunteers, Chief Medical Officer.

The breaking up of the old plantation system has necessarily left the sick with little or no medical provision except that existing among the freedmen themselves. As soon as they earn money and become better versed than now in the ordinary means of self-support, they will doubtless secure the necessary aid.

The medical officers of this bureau at the best can afford but partial relief.

### MISCELLANEOUS.

#### Of Justices.â€”As all matters relating to refugees and freedmen were committed to my supervision and management by the law, and as the old civil codes in the several insurrectionary States had become practically null and void so far as they related to the Negro, it became necessary to lay down some general rule for the officers of the bureau concerning the administration of justice. At first I confined myself to the following instructions:

**V.** Simple good faith, for which we hope on all hands from those concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve the Assistant Commissioners in the discharge of their duties towards the freedmen, as well as promote the general welfare. The Assistant Commissioners will everywhere, declare and protect their freedom, as set forth in the proclamation of the President and the laws of Congress.

**VII.** In all places of old code, in violation of the freedom guaranteed by the proclamation of the President, and the laws of Congress, disregarding the negro's right to justice before the laws, in not allowing him to give testimony, the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen being committed to this bureau, the Assistant Commissioners will adjudicate, either themselves or through officers of their appointment, all difficulties arising between whites and freedmen, or between negroes and whites or Indians, except of course where durable differences between them, and military officers of their appointment, all difficulties arising between whites and negroes, or between negroes and white or Indians, except of course where durable differences between them.

It was for this purpose that the Freedmen's Courts were established generally by the department commander; and cases passed through him for revision. In the great majority of instances that have come to my knowledge, these cases have decided favorably, but there are some exceptions, where officers composing them, having as haughty prejudice against the negro, have decided, very much against his interest, am not prepared to believe without examination or evidence punishment in no way commensurate with the offence.

The Freedmen's courts have been constituted wholly or partially of officers of the bureau. It was impossible to multiply such courts, on account of the scarcity of officers. I therefore resorted to the practice of associating civilians with these officers for the settlement of minor cases, and with limited powers as
