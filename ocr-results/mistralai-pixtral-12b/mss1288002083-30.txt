The Smith sisters of Glastonbury have lately parted with a share of bank stock and two of their pet Alderneys, rather than pay taxes in the regular way, in our present disreputable country. But the Works for Fosters, Stephen S. and Abby W. Foster, who have been refusing to pay their taxes for several years, because Abby was not allowed to vote, have clearly got sick of the martyr business. And no wonder, for it was rather expensive, and the public has been more disposed to pole fun at, than to sympathise with, the “sufferers.” The Worcester authorities have treated the Foster couple with great forbearance—recognising that, owing to rather muddled ideas of the theory of taxation, they really believed they were vindicating a principle, in refusing payment. The tendency of this idea, as The Union has often shown, is to make taxation and civil disobedience synonymous. It is only when taxation is connected with the right of suffrage or “away dependent on it. The world was taxed six thousand years before suffrage was invented, and the citizens of countries where suffrage does not exist are taxed to day without a thought of protest. Minors are taxed, nuns are taxed, and universally, in the theory and practice of civilised and uncivilised governments, taxation is recognised as the fair contribution of the citizen to the expenses of the government whose protection and conveniences he enjoys. Not to pay taxes is a thoroughly unpatriotic position of a fair citizen.
