and I am sure she would
find many old friends.
Let me urge you to honor
us by your presence, and welcome
your in behalf of your wife
as a Boston Alumnae.
As I am uncertain of
your address, I send under
cover to Mrs Clara K. Hill,
Boston.  Eagerly looking for
the pleasure of seeing you and
Mrs Douglas.  I am
most cordially yours

Sarah A. Stevenson.

Franklin, N. H. April. Monday.
