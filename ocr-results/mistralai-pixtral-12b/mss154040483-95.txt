*WANTED*. feminism in politics. The ethical movement that throws open the Dupont Circle gates to Mrs. Blair, sunny-tempered and charming exponent of women (in her present Journal articles) to be penitent and discouraged about women in politics. Her concluding sentence says she feels that women have a harder fight to make in this field than men. Why is this so? It needs to be borne in public chain of the National Democratic Committee.

Her courage and ability, her loyalty and care, her good taste and her fine mind in conventions and stirs on committees, but triad of supporting independently for an altogether different mission: that they have been widely guilty of merely following orders from men who wants them to take positions.

Mrs. Blair finds that women have created no progressive action for their politics and economies. It is an old and slightly altered problem. It is not a political power. Perhaps, but the elements of women's ability as to be punishable and discouraged about it. It does our own today for May Day as on the convention that the great masses of men and women have not really grown up yet.

A Republican woman in high political leadership has been known to express surprise that the messages, as it reminds me of the book difference in them.

Mrs. Blair suggests that the remedy is the application of the men of our party also. Mrs. Blair says there are two ways only in which women may become part of political organization: one is by holding offices and the other is by coming elective in political organizations. It is dangerous to rely on one and appeases it.
