Editor Woman's Journal,
Dear Madam,

Enclosed you will find $2.50, which I send to pay for the Woman's Journal, to be sent to my address for one year. I have hitherto received the paper through a friend, but I think I will have one of my own now, so that I can give away some to give away.

I received your kind letter last Monday, and I wish to thank you for your exceedingly careful perusal of my manuscript, and for your friendly criticism of my work. I feel more encour-
aged by your Commendations

Please write among
