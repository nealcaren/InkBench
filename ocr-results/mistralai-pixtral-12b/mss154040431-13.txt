Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race, Berlin Correspondent Reports.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.—The German central statistical office at Stuttgart in a report covering the year 1917, concerning the illegitimate births in the various states, states that at Berlin: illegitimate births-18.0 per thousand;ેનlungenburg—23.7; Halle—23.6; Leipsic—21.4; Magdeburg—24.5; Munich—23.0; Venice—31.5; Brunswick—26.9; Schlewig-Holstein—20.9; Cologne—25.5.  The report states that the cities generally show higher percentages than the rural districts. 에게 at Stuttgart, for instance, where the state is 23.0 per thousand, the city's percentage is 31.5 per thousand.  In Rhineland the rural districts are, as a rule, higher than the cities.  That значительно the difference between the upper middle class and the working class.  In Hannover the former show a much lower percentage of illegitimacy than the working classes. Each state in Germany for the regulation of birth question has its own system of registration, and bambini in unwedded motherhood.  In Prussia registration is now compulsory.  Each child-less birth must be registered in the civil registry.  The causes of illegitimacy in Prussia are seen in the promiscuity of morals of the so-called "upper ten thousand," the lack of chastity in the working class, lack of religion, the late settlement of marriage in rural districts and the attempt to evade military service. The report recommends more work among the young to make the birth consequences apparent to lessons in sexual hygiene for both medicines in the working schools.
