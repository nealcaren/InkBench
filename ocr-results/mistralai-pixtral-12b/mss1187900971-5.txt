Grandpa was never called "Hloyd."
He was first Frederick Bailey. The name
changed to Johnson when he ran
away, and because the servant
whose house he lived in, Kenderton
Mass was named Johnson: Freeman
who had just published a book
"The Lending the Hake," admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglass" asked
Grandpa - to keep from confusing
their two Johnson houses they'd
want to call himself "Frederick."
Douglass instead of Johnson.
Grandpa told them and namedは子
was as good as another - hence-
forth set out to be called
Frederick Douglass.
*There's facts - not hearsay.*

After just read letter from Ted. He
left on his "debating tour" today -
and really debating at Howard the
hill stops with pen and ink. Do already write
