My very dear Brother Robert,—

I was late getting the
news that is why my congratulations
are late reaching you. Like all
honorable men you didn't know
how glad I Toni that this great honor had come
to you and yours and you deserve
it all. This is a profound achievement for
the race. If the honors have been so unequally
distributed
