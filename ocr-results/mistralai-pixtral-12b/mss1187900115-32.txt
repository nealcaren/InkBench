to show that the war of our "Rebellion" was instigate
d by this t. s that again. They had so soundly
haunted us in the great battle-fields of Europe that on one
pretext and another the doors of the old world
were nearly closed to us as a market. Hence
our long years of squalor and starvation, a state which
our vituperated Christian Capitalists dare
not explain to the people. England & Germany,
the two great Protestant nations had been I
made to believe in a great American "deny-
mite" plot against them's we have come very
near— a — I come not name it. It is
to terrible in view of the blood of every nation in
our veins—& the spirit of bitterness and strife
in our own midst—with this t damnable issue
in ambush with their 5,000,000 so so blue-velvet
element, waiting waiting to occupy again, a
million dead men's shoes, on our land, as they
did both North & South after they had brought on
a family war—so to speak as in which brother a
brother met in mortal to the extent of almost a
nation's death. Suffice it the truth had been
reached when about 3 years ago. Sir Edwin-
