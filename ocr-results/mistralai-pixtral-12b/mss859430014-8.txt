Oct. 8, 1954.

My dear daughter, I hope
you are still getting along
alright. We are well. Daddy
is still on the job, and
keeping the house to summer
time heat, despite the nice
bright weather we are having.

Brother and part of the
family was here last night.
They thought Mrs. Cotton over
to church and waited here while
she was in service.

Daisy was not feeling
well. She had been to the Doctor
earlier in the day. He gave
her a shot, and she says it
left her feeling riggy and sleepy.
She did not look well at all. So
I called to-day, said she was feel-
ing better.

I am sending a letter
that came to-day from Hilda-
rander. And one that came
last week. So from to-day on
I will forward them as direct.
Write when you can.

Much love from us
to you. From mother.

Gloria.
