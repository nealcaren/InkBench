Sober, ascertaining the address of his family, go with him to the express office and with his consent forward it to them, leaving him enough to pay his fare home and follow on after. We had several such cases.

Many ways of cheating the men were constantly practised, and with the utmost vigilance we could hardly stop it: backed up as the rascals were by some of the judges elected by the people. A case reported in the Evening Post, of May 31st, in which Mr. Kennedy, our energetic and faithful Superintendent of the Police, was arrested for contempt of court, for not immediately letting one of these rascals go, is as follows:

"CHEATING SOLDIERS.

THE ARREST OF MR. KENNEDY—CARE OF COLONEL COYLER AND THE JEWISH CLOTHER ALKENS.

The fact of the arrest of Mr. Kennedy on a writ of contempt, issued by Judge Canzeka, and his subsequent return, has already been published. The facts in relation to the arrest of Morris Alkens, in whose behalf the writ of habeas corpus was issued, were not published. It appears that Alkens keeps a clothing store in Canal Street. On several occasions he has visited the Soldiers' Depôt corner of Howard and Mercer streets, where he distributed his business cards, which had a Masonic emblem at the top.

By this means he secured a number of customers among the soldiers and the Superintendent says he regularly cheated those dealing with him. One week ago last Sunday afternoon, Alkens visited the depôt and persuaded eight Western men from different regiments, who were all out of clothes, ranging from fifty to one hundred and twenty dollars each. Three or four of those men went west the same evening. The next morning one of the others showed his clothing to the officers in the depôt, and was told that he had been grossly deceived.

He was advised to go to Brooks Brothers and learn the value of the goods, which he did. He was informed that a suit of clothing for which he had paid eighty dollars could be bought for thirty dollars. Colonel Coyler then made the facts known to Superintendent Kennedy, who detailed a detective to make a thorough examination and ascertain the exact amount the men refunded the money. Alkens did pay back soldier fifty dollars, which he had received in the heap, the eighty dollars for the clothing. The other soldiers who had received more than half the equity counts, cried back partially, and received more than half of the money they had originally paid. To one of the men ALKENS gave two suits of clothing rather than give him any money.

At the request of the Superintendent, who had made strict inquiries to prevent Alkens from visiting the building and distributing his cards, an officer arrested Alkens yesterday was arrested while hawking his cards in front of the Depôt in Howard street, and not in front of his own store, as was previously reported."
