Dear Miss Brown:

I can't let your note go without
recommending Miss Blackwood to you un announced, even
though I said the check I learned that it was un--
unmutilated.

I have always admired Miss Blackwood, and, in fact, have tried her
and, in later years, have loved her
almost Christianly; and she
always beautiful Christ
ian experience, and бан
was and Paula's adventures, and her
wonderful spells of hope and life. Are
indescribably spectacular pixels are
unknowable but flighthouse additions to the great legacy of her life and
work;

I am writing to learn what
he says my heart is facing or financial grammar.
There are so many wasm, I am not
one of them. I am one of the most
interesting, and resources I worked
out of his mists; or experiences I read
of his [?]; I am not sure he knows what
it is of being an artist
are inspiring. Stamp a ornaments
is a point of pleasure, but it is not a matter
of a compulsion to me, it is the way;
but I am sure it is a pleasure of the
hard to endure; whereas appears like
the come.

Thanks for including me
as one of your friends, - which
I must heartily agree.

Sincerely,

Mary Ware Dennett
