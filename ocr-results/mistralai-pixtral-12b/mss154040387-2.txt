### A CALL TO ACTION

**By CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT.**

A speech made at a Mass Meeting in
Memorial Hall, Cleveland, April 13, 1921.

**Suggestive Speech submitted for**
**Suggested one on Politics**

There is not an audience in this country, nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir
in almost every heart an echo of appeal. There is not an audience before which
a speaker may attempt to international peace that does not realize
what he is speaking about, and it seems remarkable that there is not somebody in all the world who is willing
to say it. There is not anybody in any country where one wants another war. There is not anybody
who does not want peace, but how are we going to get it?

It isn't the question as to what government is the
right government, or any one who is an international peace, but it is the question
as to the way and the goal of it. If it is the question
of the right kind of a government, and it is not only the question of the right kind of a government, but it is
a question as to the rights of every person who is governed by that government. 

It is not the question as to the right kind of a government, but it is the question
