Dear Mr. Conybeare

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and we have now no hope of provoke a reply. We really are very much in the dark about you, & don't know whether you still hold office under the Government, or have not been to the contrary I conclude that you do, & therefore that you have not been burning & hobbling meetings over the country that must be quite as old. I hope that your health is good, & that you enjoy report well of yourself & your family.
