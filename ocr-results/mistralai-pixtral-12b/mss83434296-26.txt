By the Militia Law the Governor is required to furnish the troops with suitable clothing, and make arrangements with the Government of the Confederate States to receive the commutation money for the clothing furnished. This law was ratified 20th September, 1861. Immediate steps were taken to comply with the law, and although there was no clothing on hand at its passage, before cold weather most of the troops were supplied with clothing and blankets, at least so far as to prevent any suffering.

An establishment for the manufacture of clothing was put in operation in this city, immediately after the passage of the law, under Captain Garrett, Assistant Quarter Master. I enclose herewith a statement, marked "A," of the clothing and camp and garrison equipage manufactured at that establishment and turned over in the fiscal year ending September 30th.

Independent of the articles manufactured here, many purchases had to be made elsewhere to supply the troops. I enclose herewith a statement, marked "B," of the clothing and camp and garrison equipage issued by Major W. W. Pierce, Quarter Master, for the year ending September 30th.

The cost of every article of clothing has increased at such rapid rates within the last few months, that they are now more than double the price they were twelve months ago.
