## EDITOR'S PORTFOLIO.

We have received a number of let-
ters from young correspondents who
have been getting subscribers for us, and getting at the same time handsome
prizes for themselves. (See page 3 of
cover). One little girl sent three sub-
scribers, and we sent her a nice silver
fruit-knife. She then thought she would
like another to present to her dear
grandmother; so she sent us three more,
and got another fruit-knife. Another
little girl wanted a croquet set, and so
sent us twenty full subscribers. Others
have got wallets, books, note-paper,&c.
Will our little readers help us to
establish "THE NURSERY" prosper-
ously by doing a similar work?

For seven full subscribers we will
send one of the excellent Craig micro-
scopes with a prepared object-glass, all
ready for use.

OSCAR PLETSCI. — The well-known
critic of "The Boston Transcript" who
writes under the name of "Tom Folio,"

"What Landscapes is to dogs, what
Rose Donheur is to horses, what Mot-
ley is to the press, what Teusler is to
Dutch boor Oscar Pletsch is to chil-
dren — their painter, interpreter, im-
mortality. It has been said that
Pletsch has never had a superior, and
probably not an equal, in his specialty
of sketching children. For presenting
the American public with the best dis-
plays of art possible, the *Nursery* de-
serves the thanks of all
lovers of art. If you would, obtain an
idea of Pletsch's genius — his humor,
truth, gentiality, and beauty — get a set
of 'The Nursery,' and carefully exam-
ine his designs. If you are not charmed
with the first keeping shop, 'A Young
Salesman,' 'The Little Deserter,' 'Hard
Day's Wash,' 'I've Been A-
Maying,' 'You Can't Come In,' 'The
Children's Auction,' 'A morning Call,'
'Cooking Dinner,' 'Getting Ready for
Breakfast,' &c., I advise you not to set
up for a connoisseur."

This admirable artist is now engaged
upon some designs made expressly for
"The Nursery," and which will appear in
our numbers for 1868. Three of Pletsch's
drawings appear in this number, as will
be seen by our Table of Contents.
