Sylvester will send me the books
to Skake and Shaker Hill. I have
not been well enough to go out
much, but I have been so much
better. I am better now than I
have been all winter. I have been
out for a walk - though my son
wrote me and his wife's attendance
would have been a comfort to me.
I must have been very sick - for
I have been writing almost as I
was last winter. I should like to
hear from home, since I have
not heard from you, as I have
from other friends. I have not
been well enough to write as
you would have from me. I
have been very busy, but I am
well enough to write to you.

Yours from affectionate
son Charles H. Douglas
