I feel that I am growing old
am not sure now what I have
been - although there has
been quite generous writing
one Developer will see that
this letter is harder
for me to write now than in old times when my
nerves are weary and I can not give
my mind records to your life in which my good health
happily is hobbleting. If you can remember this
letter you will notice and
believe me as ever your
rom fullest(&) everlasting
failure friend Buffums

About says come and see
us I say Amen. IF you have
now an engagement not
fulfilled but B.T. will

But it fails hope that you
are well and prosperous in your
life and

Hope jewel is well

cheerful myself and bless you all

James M Buffums
