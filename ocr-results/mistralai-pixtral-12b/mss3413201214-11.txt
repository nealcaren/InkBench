Dear Honorable Friend

There is to be a suffrage legendary here on Nov 7th and we are to have a false Journal booth - Can you send a letter of endorsement, and a large card, if possible, some "Newspaper" page - and I have about 50 subscription blanks.  I have never done anything of this sort and have little idea how to go about it -

But Dr. Monroe who is getting up the festival telephoned this morning that Alice Paul had sent her word she would not pay the cost of creating a booth for the Suffragists and of she.  I Dr. Mae N. had to pay the cost of creating the booth she would accept if he used for the Journal the paper she preferred to help - I promised to see if
