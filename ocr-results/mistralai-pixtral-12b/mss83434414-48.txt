Refugees and freedmen will not be gratuitously issued to teachers of refugees or freedmen, or to other persons voluntarily laboring for the benefit of such persons, but such teachers and others as are so engaged may be permitted to make their own purchases, and may purchase rations of the government under the rules and regulations, which apply to such rations when made by commissioned officers of the army.

 Free transportation will be granted to such teachers on government transports and military transports, post, &c.

Public buildings, or buildings that may have been seized from disloyal owners, not required for military purposes, may be used for occupation for schools, teachers', soldiers' Bereaus, &c.
