### Core Principles

#### Transcribe What You See

- Retain the structure and layout of the table
- Separate columns with a single vertical dash "â€”"
  
#### Do Not Transcribe
- Exclude headers and any explanatory text outside the table

### Text Handling

#### Basic Text
- Transcribe each individual entry as written, including numerals, abbreviations, and symbols
- Failure to capture mutilated information adequately can be indicated by surrounding [?] the likely fields

#### Special Cases
- Use [?] where text is not readable or replaced

### Special Situations

#### Illegible or Unclear Text
- Insert [?] for illegible fields
- Preserve the reading order from left to right for each row

#### Text Modifications
- Exclude any explanatory notes added after the table
- If there is a need for corrections, provide in a note form below the table

### Languages and Characters

#### Non-English Text
- Treat all abbreviations as non-translatable, transcribe precisely

### Quality Guidelines

##### General Approach
