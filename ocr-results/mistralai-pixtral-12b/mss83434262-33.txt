showed over and under the massive deck. Re-embarking, the visitors gave three cheers for the *Nanube*, which were responded to with a hearty good will by the happy crew, who resumed their operations and pastimes.

### BEDLOE'S ISLAND.

Crossing the harbor, the steamer pushed rapidly for Bedloe's Island, and we were soon ashore for a brief ramble. Col. Chas. S. Merchant, of the regular army, received the ladies, several of whom had resided on the island in the days of hospitals and of battles, when Bedloe's Island did good service. The stay of the party before very short, they contented themselves with a hasty glimpse of the hospital, the barracks, and the fine residence of Col. Colone's family. The Colone's family was gratified by the visit and unremitting attentions. The donations to the garrison and patients on the island consisted of 400 baskets of strawberries, 2 baskets of cherries, 1 box of whortleberries, 2 barrels turnips, 1 barrel beans, 4 quarters lamb, 2 bags peas, 200 head each of cabbage and lettuce, and 50 bunches of radishes and beets. The garrison consists of the Sixty-second New York Regiment, 300 strong, under the command of Col. W. W. McKinley. The hospitals are nearly all empty, and are soon to be pulled down. Everything is in admirable order, and as clean as a pin. Dr. Philip Adolphus, U. S. A., is in charge.

### FORT LAFayette.

Heading down the harbor our little craft was soon fairly on her way toward Fort Lafayette, whose forbidding structure was famous enough to render the sight of it an object of interest. We had committed overt act of treason, as must the sovereign people of New York, and were therefore in a sense under arrest. Passing Staten Island, whose beautiful scenery attracted the eye and refreshed the senses, we kept upon the even tenor of our way, enjoying the cool and bracing sea breeze as it came dancing over the waves, from Sandy Hook. Saluting passing steamers with shrill whistles, wafting hankerchiefs to a mail steamer just coming from over the Atlantic, the passengers, no doubt, glad to see the flag again, flapping in the one breeze, and taking it easy the while, we were last furiously on the deck of the *Nanube*.

Receiving a kind invitation to land, the plank was once more run out, or rather up, and the ladies safely piloted up the perilous ascent. Gaining the interior, we were escorted through the cor-
ridor by Lieut. Smith, to the quarters of Brevet Brig-Gen. Burke, or as he is generally known, "Col. Burke." The old gentleman was in a very amiable mood, and received his fair visitors in his customary style with courtesy and grim politeness.

The garrison consists of the seventeenth United States Infantry,
