![Alice Stone Blackwell Portrait](image-url)

An undaunted devotee to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, the pioneer of women's rights. Her life has been dedicated to the furtherance and development of women's rights. She belongs to the Stockbridge family of Massachusetts. In her pronunciation there is a softness that is by no means lacking in girlishness and charm. With her first public address at the Women's International Congress in Berlin in 1896, she was one of the earliest workers for the suffrage cause.
