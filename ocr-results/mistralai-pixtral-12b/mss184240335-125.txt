I wrote in 1840 are collected here; the
period mainly after 1825 and before 1850,
but there is none more recent. I did not
myself collect them nor does any one know
from whence they came. I have arranged them
according to their apparent and manifest
meaning. They are for the most part short,
short cut phrases, and yet often they
suggest some profound thoughts. Some are
quoted from the Bible; some from the next
higher authority! A few are wholly unintelligible to
myself; though the pronoun I occurs in the boldest
words and whole sentences are in English. My
work, in compiling these, has been to put down
words which have good claims to the meaning I
have given them. If I have any error reducing the
words down to my meaning the right of any one to
reason on the document is it is never the less
true and valid, although the meaning is disputed.
What you read from the Bible is not disputed;
it is the meaning of the text you donâ€™t agree. I
you remove it from the context you get as true as
everything and all that follows from it, are true
regardless of what God says through. But the whole
colamentis ar and it is that it is written the sentence
