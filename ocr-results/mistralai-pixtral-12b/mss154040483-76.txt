### THE WOMAN CITIZEN

# Whose Government is This?

### By Carrie Chapman Catt

THE question for our consideration is whether the department of Election Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it a part of the League of Women Voters. It may at this moment be less apparent to many women than it was ten months ago, for we have already begun to exact the fulfillment which will make women voters the fulfillment of the task to which women voters now contribute in the exemplification of the ideal of equal political equality. Women voters, to whom the League of Women Voters should be dropped, for example, Women's Equal Suffrage League of Kansas concerned with the many questions why it does not function and hardened into political antagonisms. But for women voters to comprehend its need, they must realize that the political department should be dropped there is no other plan.

It may secure the orders of that party, and the measure desired by the party can be altered through an irregular legislature of rural election districts Districted chairman, to defeat a referendum.

Why were the railroad affiliations? Certainly not because the railroads cared whether women voted or not. Why was it that holders of the County Your Department Works determined against ratification? It was because they, quite disconcerted, combined them with the funds and with the expectation that all the lobbies would be combined in support of their own program.

Here is the address made by Mrs. Catt at the Cleveland Convention of the League of Women Voters when, at her request, the department of Election Laws and Methods was elevated to a department of work called Efficiency in Government. This speech was written to be used in large mass meetings. These meetings were held to explain to the public the function of government and to the people's wishes that it has been repeatedly asked for by our readers.
