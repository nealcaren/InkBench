My dear Steady: I have to thank you for two
letters and the notes and clippingsd concerning
Mrs. Blaine. I thank you especially for the lip-
simple information as you suspect, I am interested
in her outgongталь}$yes, in Bayfield, at one
National Convention. I'm sure [she] bought
a letter from Effie Vance,
and she had described very vividly her
Mrs. Blaine had been able to rise about her
suffering for'Christian Science.  She says Suince
learns[?] and as she read it, and she was no
lessoning the reading of Mrs BD通常. I hope she lets
me that Effie Vance was also getting similar
experience in Ch. See Mrs B was one of the most
generous and forgiving natured women I have ever
met, and she also had her satur[ineus?] of
-protection as she was to the strands of many
d und Seome to be admired for very many
estimable qualities.
