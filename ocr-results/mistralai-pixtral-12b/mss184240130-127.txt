Some little things I cannot
mention. The little old order
more than ever. I've just come
ab home & feel lonesome & not
sure the thing. I've got some
things to get & some things after
which I'm going to get & my trunk after
next & I'll be gone. I do miss
Denver. I miss him so my
souls heart to hear dear
old golden heart. He's not motion
of my heart. I've not seen my
soul since I've been here. I've
seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
me. I've seen the world & he's here to see
