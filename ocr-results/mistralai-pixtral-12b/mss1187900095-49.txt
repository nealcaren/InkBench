3 pirchase, and I trust I place
have your approval as well as
that of friend Barlett.

Mr. Blaine has been sick in now
work for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get any
better. There
is much interest manifested in
his condition.

I thank you for long and very
kind letter, and regret that I cannot
feel well enough to pay to you
now all that I had it in mind
to pay when I began it. But we
got worked out even when we are
very young men and I am
afraid to run
a long once.

With any kindest regards,
Yours truly, J. P. Blaine
