**Your Investments**

**By Eleanor Keen**

**TWO policies issued by insurance companies which are very popular with women buyers are income bonds and retirement income annuities. The advantages of these investment order mentioned in our last article are income bonds and retirement income annuities. The advantages of these investment orders to women are described in our last article and the interested reader is referred to that article for further details. Briefly, income bonds provide an annual income for a term of from five to thirty years. Two thirds of the premium is used in the form of a loan to the company. At the end of the bond period, the principal is repaid and any interest that has accumulated belongs to the owner. Retirement income annuities, on the other hand, provide an income for life beginning at some particular age. One-third of the premium is used in the form of a loan to the company. The balance is invested and the income obtained is used as the basis for the annuity. This income is paid during the owner's life, beginning atretirement age. The income is always a fixed sum irrespective of the fluctuations in the income of the investment. Recently the committee devised a plan by which it can be converted into a lifetime annuity.**

**It is a common misunderstanding that women have no need for adequate life insurance. One of the great needs of a woman, however, is the security that life insurance provides. Some degree of security should be provided for her dependents in the event of her death. This is particularly important at the time of the woman's marriage. The need for life insurance does not end with the death of the woman's husband. The importance of life insurance for a widow is sometimes overlooked. With the increase in the cost of living, the woman needs more than ever the protection that life insurance provides. The woman's need for life insurance is never greater than after the death of her husband. Life insurance is important for a woman at any age, and the need may increase as the years go by. The amount of life insurance that a woman needs depends on her individual needs. Life insurance is not an expensive venture. A policy of $1,000 is a very good starting point. It can be increased as the years go by and the need for greater protection increases. Life insurance can be arranged in a variety of ways. It can be in the form of a straight life policy, a term policy, or a group policy. It can be arranged to protect the woman's dependents in the event of her death, or it can be arranged to provide her with an income for life. Life insurance is a valuable tool for protecting the woman's dependents and for providing her with an income for life. Women should not underestimate the importance of life insurance. The need for life insurance can be a great好迎合真实生活妻觉悟. She canle of建造一个包含所有生活 차지。**

**Personal income bonds and retirement income annuity have just recently come under consideration. The draft of the formal report of the action of the committee has just been given out. It was done last week and is now being given serious consideration. In the report of last week, the Committee reported two important points and these were finally crystalized into two resolutions. One was for time and reference to be given to the draft of the proposed resolution for a questionnaire to be sent to all members of the League asking those states that have not taken steps under the new regulation to appoint committees, both state and local, to study conditions and to make recommendations for a uniform standard.
