SPANISH FORT, ALABAMA, APRIL 9, 1863.
A PIECE OF PAPER, IN PENCIL, WITH SOME WRITTEN ON IT, AND A HAND-WRITTEN LETTER, I RECEIVED FROM A SOLDIER IN THE 42D REGIMENT, SIGNED BY THE AVERY, LIE. COL. WITH ILL. INFANTRY, "written by Andrew Parr to me." I am very glad to hear from him, and to know that he is well. He was the first to invest the fort the 27th last month, and have been here ever since. He has not lost many men yet, I killed and I wounded, is all of the regiment. He has a good command, and is well pleased with it. The fort is mounted by steel, with 15,000 negro troops. The Rebels have a perfect battery in them, and the troops are well prepared. They have been reinforced by 10,000 more troops, and are trying to cut off their communication with Mobile. Much more excellent content, talks about how they are planting some big 100 lb. perret guns, the Rebels have laid torpedoes every think in the creek which we have to cross to get to the fort. In the creek there are some rocks which have killed quite a number of their men who have walked out them (the forefather of the land). I will try to get more in the next letter.
