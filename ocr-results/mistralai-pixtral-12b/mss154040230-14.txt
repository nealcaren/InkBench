Translation of Dr. M. Rear's letter of December 20th, 1941

Dear Mrs. Cutting-

I did not reply immediately to your last letter because I wished to send you some information on the steps we have taken with our government.

We have obtained copy of the telegram sent by Dr. Le Breton Argentine Minister to Washington. The telegram sent to our government by the United States Legation here, in both communications it is established that the Congress is not official and that consequently the delegates cannot be official.

We are awaiting the response that our government will make to the demand that we have made to add us in bearing the expenses of the delegation, because the $500. of which the note of the delegation speaks, is absolutely insufficient, as the price of the trip to the United States is in addition to the $450. we would like to know whether the delegation is in a position to bear its hotel and transportation expenses in the United States.

I hope that we shall obtain the support of the government; we shall communicate the result to you immediately.

I urge that we may receive as soon as it is possible all publicity that you may have on the Congress, in order that the names of other South American delegates may be published in our press.

In my next letter I will tell you whether I can go myself to the Congress, as it is my greatest desire to do so.

I hope to have soon the pleasure of seeing you; and in the meantime accept the expression of my best wishes,

Alicia Moreau

P.S. I have received your letter of December 16th.
