I know not where toNode have justünus-
for them. I appeal to your judgment;
I have owed them fidelity to the
Colonized cause, during almost twenty
years in Cape May & Philadelphia;
I stand to them; I owe to them,
 RPMirtest a permanent commercial;
trance,
under the name of William Darrach,
Alb., he is well known to the present;
President of the County, as for years he,
was interested in the purchase of
around by Caffee. For the House of Orlunis, Saroche,
& Co., he was also known
for the United States, and The,
advertisement of Saroche was affected
by his name. From such facts, his deed
in the State Department,
he soлет his as to write bars is to do
all dungerside &pining that my
servant of the Colonized People..?
Begging you to excuse, no for
addressing yourself I remain

Oay Respectfully
