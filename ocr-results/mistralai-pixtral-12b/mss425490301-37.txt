The California State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs was organized in Oakland in 1906 by Mrs. Eliza Warner of Los Angeles, Mrs. Elizabeth St. Charles Edwards of Los Angeles, and Mrs. Katherine D. Tillman of Oakland, all of whom were leaders in the church, fraternal and civic life of the State of California and have given the better part of her service for the protection of womanhood, home and child.

In 1907, the Federation was derived from contacts with greater powers, the California State joined the great National Federation in 1908, and adopted a part of the National program for a part of the State's.

During the 25 years of the State Federation a great deal of study and research has been done in the field of child welfare and the club life and instead of the one State organizer, an organizer was elected for each section of the State and many clubs were brought into the Federation.

Aside from carrying out the State program many clubs in the various sections have built and maintained Institutional Homes for young girls and boys; the following are a few: Industrial Home, Los Angeles; Women's Day Nursery, Los Angeles; Fanny Wall Children's Home and Day Nursery, Oakland; East Side Mother's Home, Los Angeles; Home for Working Girls, Los Angeles; and the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women, Los Angeles. These institutions became the monuments of the Federation and caused a Monumental Day to be held at each State Convention.

The State gives an annual scholarship which began in 1916.
