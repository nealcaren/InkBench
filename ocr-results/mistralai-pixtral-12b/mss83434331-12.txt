#### (c) PREABLE.

"Warners, unconditional slavery exists to a Drravd extent amongst us as a nation, in vio-
lation of those principles that moved our fathers to the broadful struggles of the Revolution—
“that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalien-
able rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” ...

Yet, to the military of the South is deterministic to perpetuate it by means scarcely less
tragical than the tortures of the Inquisition, and the (bloodthirsty) aristocracy of the North
retards their “civilized” marketed enemies of the South in...iety apparent... and imp... to...
their attempt's result. The treatment to which black men have been (unique?)...

Warner's, the toll has arrived at which the descendants of the pilgrims must determine
whether they will sustain the shameful and cowardly precedent of surrendering their most
(ineffable?) rights and resting upon the (chianof?) spirit of their exiting difficulty and hold out
anything that the spirit of their fathers manfully maintain them.

Aro! Warners, if we remain silent and inactive, we effectively surrender their rights, and
wish them the hopes of the slave, till the prediction of Jefferson shall be verified, and the
stall is carried into the sun, and a crown that Poll shall spread with the blood of his hands.

Therefore, Reservoirs, under a dispatch (speaker?) to sources, to the slaves, to our country,
and to God, and (margin?) “Aink or swamp, live or die,” we will exercise the just Missouri,
that inspire thy banner with the fresh furs of tomorrow's and rend nations rows for the
equality and good treatment of the slaves; and I am something but they will be sacrificed,
to a society we must repudiate which the subjects of the government and aspicious and what the
following, &c.

#### (d) ABOLITION.

Some forty miles from Cincinnati, to the East, are two settlements of free negroes—probably
nearly a thousand—men, women and children, of the (beau color?) with a very little scar-
tily of the harmony or slight shades. The negroes own the land occupied by them, but
three thousand acres it seems were not bought for them, but (현신?) for them there at a
price of $15,000. No names are published for the land, and they sold out for them about
ten years ago.

Their land is not, in a sense, of the best quality of Ohio lands; but by good management they
mark it, they are capable of making it a very profitable settlement. The negroes have been
granted the same rights and privileges and to the same (express?) conditions as other citizens.
And they have had some good advantages to industry and good faith to them. The experiment
was a success.

No country can equal the artificial (Dusen blogs?) produced from the country of the negroes?:
In all Ohio, can any white settlement be
found equally (productive?) to that of the negroes? A miles of their farms have been well improved,
and they have been better prepared for the future improvement of the farms, and have been
peopled with a similar series of farms in the state of the negroes. And the negroes have been
improved as business.

Why not the problem is the easier to say, and the lazy and the slothful, of the black race on
their own farms, their farms, their farms (not to the slaves they are) and the lavender on our
favors, the same at their homes, and the (same) is no longer on their freedoms. They pass most
of their time in the (neuro) of the (slave) camps who are called, passing a lot of gravel and cabins
with bushшно circus cabins with all the music (and) with the sounds of guns, in the public
house and fence}}) with the roads and the ( rápid?)} are not way find the consoling care of their
work the best possible quality, while they are much too lazy to obtain their opium.

Why do not the zealous Abolitionists go there and see the experiment in all its beauty—like
slaves changed in the analytics? Why not make something of these thousand
heavens where they are upon the best farms and three families out of three of their freedom?
How, then, the new change of slavery into freedom.

The negro settlements are a dead weight upon Brown county, as to any productive hee-
dogs from the negro lands, or from negro labor; and that space of country might as well, to
the day, have remained in the woods. No improvement in health or (cigre?) living in the nation
of the... has always proved such a wretched po-
lation, what farmer in Ohio is safe? Has he any guarantee that a black colony will not be
established in his neighborhood?

Let any one who wishes to learn the operation of emancipated negroes, visit the Brown
county and see for himself. The slaves, poverty and dirt, are those who make them equal to
the negroes at all, and...no property as they only to make them (productive?) to
the negroes of the Niger.
