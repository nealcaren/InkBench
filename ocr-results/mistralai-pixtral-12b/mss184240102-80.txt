My dear friend,

I have been driven to write to thee
by an absolute uncertainty as to where
I can best conceal my thoughts and
express them to thee at just that time
I could not have met thee.  I was Ã©crire
to Farmer Mr D. I was very
much disappointed to hear as halt you & Mother
engaged yourself in washing.  I do take it all come from
me.  All come down to in
self for that same to in
write.  But this weather makes
fine if we are going summer
