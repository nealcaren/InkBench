I think that is quite un-
usual for a six-year old boy.  Do if you could lend
it to the Sunday School I would be very happy indeed.

Please remember me to Miss
Wilson & Mrs Peck and be
sure to let me know if they
or you come to Washington.

With affectionate greetings

 fechafully yours,
Harness H. Darby
