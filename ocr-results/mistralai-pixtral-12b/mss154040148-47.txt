Porto, Spain.
Nov 26, 1923

My dear Mollie:

I fancy you'll excuse me for a
caber and rum is here. I remain
anyway sure that I suppose that progress
is in the discolored frequency and that you
for not cabled at all.

Nov 27 - I was interrupted here and now being
at things any different and time has passed
your cable has been received, and it was such
a relieving thought it. Imagine you passing through
a relieving stage when you think you
that all is over again and when life has
never met he sold again and when life has
lost all its fever. But keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. I am so glad
you are better. This world seems to be a
black and place somehow you dear Mollie.
I expected from you a note here
as soon as you a note here
he would thought if it was a good mail
cable from it would be a good mail
steamer, but it seems many American
