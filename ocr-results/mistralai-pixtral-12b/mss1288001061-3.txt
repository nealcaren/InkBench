And now glad & feel that they have
brought thee home thou hast taken
away. I had hoped over and beyond
many vain wishes and am content to
find myself beloved and useful for a
time. Mr. Scherer.

I think thou would'st be sorry for my
father were thou to see how he has been
treated, how his mental powers are broken
and his health ruined. The care of her is over-
whelming to him, for she is in the border land
between sanity and insanity, and cannot walk or
speak, and often wanders than
herself. She is quite an aged womanâ€”
seventy-five years old.

And yet, Dad as it is, it is in some way
easier that the relations between us
need to be. She has no power any more to
show her life, and consequence is comparatively
easy, because of thefulness of her
present condition.

But you tell me wonder why you are in
this beautiful but far away and separated
from all thy friends and show the many
interests which have heretofore made thy
life. It does complete contrast in large
its can hardly be imagined than thy
surroundings here.

Thy brother & sister, an able fellow
of Medical Science, have very kindly
become a physician. He had a brilliant
professional future before him, overcoming
both mental strain and overwork, his
health gave way. To fall a victim to that
deadful disease consumption was a
blow no less severe than if he had
died. We were here when Madison Square had
a very trying one in regard to weather,
and a very sad one to be led as we were
falling slowly our way back before the
sudden death of my oldest brother
Sweep Young who had educated
himself & all our hearts to give a
remarkable character.
