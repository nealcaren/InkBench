near death, when a visitor
is his peg, and our dentist here said
he could cure him and
put one drop of turpentine on his navel,
the precedent of which I had
seen in a journal of about
to-day - The Doctor had
tried everything without
 avail, and as he could- not
hopelessly harass him
I thought he might try

The have too for more of
the cabinet of Judge
Torrey to love their, if
anything can be done to
cure them, and I trust
by the time this reaches
you you will not need
the or any other remedy,
that your husband will
be hollow the road to
recovery.
