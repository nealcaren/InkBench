a                 letter in Washington.  -   
then I said I would write one.    
This is my first attempt.  
How you are given up to your  
journey to Europe.  Do you &   
cannot help being glad as the   
are a good many reasons why.  
I thank rather frank of you 
both to me & to us. - If accepter  
had written as formerly, I should  
not have so long postponed my   
enquiries - But I am obliged   
to contain my letters both as to  
number & length.  
I hope that it will turn  
out that you are to pass the  
Winter in your pleasant and   
comfortable home - Why should  
you brave the terrors of the  
raging seas and many unknown  
lines when you can so well arrange   
in your quiet country retreats   
here?   Not in fame or gain have   
I give you stay, - but Peth of you -   
 rasch of you - I wish to see a notion   
of your bosom and wish that  
I was there to enjoy it.  I'm  
sure that *you* can make your   
experience more interesting and  
congenial.    Your friends   
Douglas has I doubt not his   
hands full of business.  I do not know 
about what you can assist  
him if you have not I see    
that you can do yourself.  
I wrote to Mr Sforza to     
day and tell you what he had to   
say; as your movements  
because of its much I am certain   
that you cannot receive my   
Washington and he also is on the road   
to Pittsburg Spring.  
I want the Douglases to enjoy   
great mental pleasure and to see  
ridden his winning team.  His   
may stay as long as possible with us.
