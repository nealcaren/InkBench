**ALICE STONE BLACKWELL**, more than may other living persons, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status.

But her work of editing the Woman's Journal and of leading the struggle for woman suffrage was on a larger and deeper plane than that of many other leaders. For she brought to it an extra dimension of private affinity, for her hobby was to make beautiful pets and her motto was "affection first." Her gifts for the beautiful and affectionate naturally supported the humanuff cylinders for broad unadulterated natural beauty. In the practical rangeaic she applied her rich wisdom, vast information, steady aimed and well tested principles of beauty which she had inherited with mother's milk.
