Washington D.C.

My dear father.

I have received your kind letter and was very glad to hear from you, but I am so sorry that you are feeling so bad going to Rochester, I hope it will be all right there. When you go there, I shall take good care of your letters and not think of disobeying them in any way. We have had a fine very cold, snowy weather that we have not had pleasant winter.
