CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.

against the lawful government; holding public meet-
ings to incite the people to the commission of treason;
plotting treason; framing and passing ordinances of
secession; organizing and forming new governments
within any of the States, with the intent that they
shall become independent of the United States, and
hostile thereto; the making of treaties between the
several States; refusal to take the oath of allegiance
to the United States, when tendered by proper author-
ity; resistance to civil process, or to civil officers of the
United States, when such resistance is not so general
as to constitute war. Each of these and many other
public wrongs may be so committed as to avoid the
penalty of treason, because they may not be overt acts
of levying war, or of aiding and comforting the enemy,
which the offender must have committed before he can
have rendered himself liable to be punished for treason
as defined in the constitution. These and other similar
offences are perpetrated for the purpose of overthrow-
ing government. Civil war must inevitably result from
them. They might be deemed less heinous than open
rebellion, if it were not certain that they are the four-
teen from which the streams of treason and civil war
must flow, sweeping the innocent and the guilty with
resistless tide onward to inevitable destruction.

ALL ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PUNISHED.

Of the many atrocious misdeeds which are pre-
liminary to or contemptuous with treason, each and
all may be and should be punishable by law. It is by
no means desirable that the punishment of all of them
should be by death, but rather by that penalty, which,
depriving the criminal of the means of doing harm,
