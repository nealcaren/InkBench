Whereas, according to the Declaration of our National Independency, Government derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, weigally Crossfine that as the right of Suffrage is the only means to secure to Women the equal exercise and enjoyment of every other right; we do hereby request hearing before the Legislature by our accredited Representatives.
