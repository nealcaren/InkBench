### GIVE SPECIAL HEED TO THESE DIRECTIONS.

This method depends upon the clearest possible explanation of the Principles and Elements of Pencilling. The Directions are not easy to understand; in making them intelligible to you, I have used these contractions:

- m.l.: Main Line
- c.l.: Connecting Line
- m.l.s.: Main Line Slopes
- c.l.s.: Connecting Line Slopes
- m.m.: Modified
- p.p.: Principal Punct
- p.: Point

### THE ELEMENTS.

The diagram below the copy, the part made at each Count, the Principles, and the way the elements are formed, are explained in the text of this manual.

### PRINCIPLES.

1. The only possible way of teaching Pencillography is to have the student write the same phrase as the instructor. The student's phrase should be copied exactly as the instructor writes it, and although the student may be better able to master the principle when the instructor reproduces it in various ways, yet the student's phrase should be the same as the instructor's.
2. Whenever possible, the student should write the entire phrase at once, but in the first and fifth principles, the stem lines, r, d, h, o are introduced.
3. The Contractions used are as follows—m.l.: Main Line; c.l.: Connecting Line; m.s.: Main Line Slopes; c.s.: Connecting Line Slopes; m.m.: Modified; p.p.: Principal Punct; p.: Point.
4. The first few principles explain the elements, and serve to introduce the Principles more fully.
5. The Diagram shows the form the phrase should have.
6. The phrase should be written with a single stroke.

6. The phrase should be written with a single stroke.

### GENERAL RULES.

1. The pen should rest on the paper, and the point should not be allowed to be raised from the paper until the line is written except in p. Be sure the wrist does not touch; it should be high enough from the desk to allow a holder to be passed under its right side.
2. Do not allow the pen to be passed from the left hand to the right until the line is finished. This is particularly true when the line is written, by asking questions on each particular kind of stroke, as knowledge, which the class answer by raising their hands. The errors lie on the side of the curve. If the curve is too great, the stroke will be too wide or too light; if the line is too narrow, the curve will be too much or too little. The turn will be crooked, or too quick, or too slow. The student will find it very difficult to correct these errors, but they are easily corrected, if he has one more line written. Thus, the teacher displaces the error and has a continuous connection with the student, and thus, the student has a clear understanding of each stroke, and directs his attention to it in the next exercise.
3. Use the most uniform strokes, both the head and base lines. 3. The Main Lines are the straight lines and the sides of the ovals written downwards; the ovals, the second stroke of 6 and f; and the second and fourth of g. See Manual, Chap. III. The Connecting Lines are the rest of the curve written upwards. The Turns unite with the Connecting Lines. Sometimes the turns unite with the Main Line or the Connecting Line. Those fastened by the Main Lines are termed Combining Lines. 4. The odd numbers are also used for the up-strokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are five elements, numbered in the order in which they are introduced. 6. Calculations of curves, lines and circles.
7. The odd numbers are also used for the up-strokes; the even, for the down. 5. There are five elements, numbered in the order in which they are introduced. 6. Calculations of curves, lines and circles.
