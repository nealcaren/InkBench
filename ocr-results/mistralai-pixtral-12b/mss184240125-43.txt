I came to Boston in New York
mule in short-visit before winter. I
am still here, now waiting for weather
to be gone. I have never very quietly, only
seen the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken now
nor easily. I thought I should
see you there this spring, knows. Mr. Brisbane
says so, it has been a trying winter,
but Spring I suppose are snow he alive.
oric writes me often, it is happy if
her lot of house-work made easy. I
but if she is shut in, she can notales
enjoy society, that she feels, the horse
sin is good. She has a good practical man, so
keep them happy without my help. Saint's
easy. You know you dear always.

Lovingly - PRAMAME LUCY.
