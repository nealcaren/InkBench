There were many pleasant things to diversify the wearisome work.

Louisa M. Alcott, then at the height of her popularity, wrote in re-
ply to a request for her help:

Concord, Oct. 1, 1878.

Dear Mrs. Stanton:
I am so busy just now fraying "woman's right to labor" that I have
no time to help prove "woman's right to vote." I read your note about
the family meeting where you said, "What shall I say to Mrs. Stanton?" A voice from
the transcendent fog which usually obscures my honored father instantly replied, "Tell her you are ready to follow your leader, sure
that you could not have a better one." My brave old mother, with the
grind of many unreckable days shining in her face, cried out, "tell
her I am seventy-three, but I mean to go to the polls before I die.
Even if my three daughters have to carry me," and two little men, al-
ready nurtured in, added the cheering words, Who shall let you vote as much as we [do*]?

In answer to a request by a lady from Chicago, which I am now writing the temper of the small Convention of which I am now
president, I cannot possibly eat say [this.I cannot undertake to eat say that], though I may not be with
you in the body, I shall be in spirit, and am, as ever,
lovingly and heartily yours,

Louisa May Alcott.

Miss Alcott dropped in at the office of the Suffrage Association
the other day and left a check for a hundred dollars, saying that she had
earned it before breakfast. In those days a hundred dollars was a large
sum.
