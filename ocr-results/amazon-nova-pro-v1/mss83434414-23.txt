FREEDMEN'S BUREAU.


The friends of the freedman claim for him a weight of intellectual brain equal to his white
fellow-man.  A number of the medical officers interested in the cause are, when opportunity
offers, investigating the subject, and it is confidently expected that from this source, as well
as others, many interesting statistics will be added to the archives of the bureau.


The officers of the medical staff in charge of the districts are entitled to great credit for
efficient administration of medical affairs, a result anticipated from the record made by these
gentlemen during the war. The cordial co-operation always given by the officers of the other
staff departments of the bureau has relieved embarrassment and encouraged me in my official
labors.


In concluding this report I beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the facilities at all times
afforded by the Commissioner to the medical branch of the bureau.


Very respectfully, your obedient servant,


CALEB W. HORNOR.


Surgeon United States Volunteers, Chief Medical Officer.
