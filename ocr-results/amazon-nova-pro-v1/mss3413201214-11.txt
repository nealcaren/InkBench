Dear Journal Friend
There is to be a suffrage festival here Nov 14 and that 15 and we are to have a Woman's Journal booth - Can you send us any decoration and a large card 30th ?be have some "Newsie" Page and I have about 50 subscription Blanks. I've never done anything of this sort and have little idea how to go about it. - But Dr. Mac Margiton who is getting up the festival telephoned this morning that Alice Paul had sent her word she would not pay the cost of creating a booth for the Suffragist and if she; Dr. Mac. N. had to pay the cost of erecting the booth she would at it be used for the Journal the paper she prepared to help- I at promised to see to it.
