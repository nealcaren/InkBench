Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note about
I can't let you misunderstood, even
mis Beachmele for unwarranted  like 2 send
if the Chesla Jones must be omitted admired mis Blackwell,
I have always have loved ber
and in late years beautiful Christ
especially Paul murepan, and her
mas and Spiritual grace are such
incombutable addition to the great back-
lonely background of her life work.

It wangs my heart to know that
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.  There are
so many who are! I am one
of them myself; or if otherwise I would
share in making the fund which you
are raising - Being a starwng artist
is a most painful handicap in
every way, but in particularly
hard to endure, when appeals lie
that come.

Thank you for including me
as one of her friends, - which
I most hear tily am.

Sincerely,
Many Ware Dennett.
