`THE AMERICAN NATION, embracing in its origin the elements of civilization found in all other races, has, as a portion of its manifest destiny, the taking to itself of the Good and Beautiful, wherever found and in whatever land. Civilization progresses westward, yet it cannot be independent of its sources. As we avail ourselves of the scientific improvements of other races, or as others avail them- selves of ours, so should there be a mutual enjoyment of the advan- tages to be derived from the intellectcal labours of those great minds which have conferred glory on their native countries and on the world. Every truly great writer is invariably a cosmopolite, who thinks and labours for the whole world, and there is no part of that world, which has not a claim to enjoy and profit by his labours.

German literature is rich in great and geniai poets, who well deserve to be made known to every one in our own continent, who claims to be well educated or informed. Genuine classic literature is the best and most appropriate reading for an intellectual and inde- pendent public-in it the old find a calm pleasure, the middle-aged an incentive to earnest thought and action, and the young a guide to that enjoyment of the beautiful, to which their every intellectual and physical sense is so keenly alive. Being convinced that both publisher and author should spare no pains, either in the literary or mechanical preparation of sound classic works, and having been still further induced, by the representations of those engaged in instruc- tion, of the necessity of such an undertaking, I have determined to give to the great names of German literature a home on American soil. Since the twenty-fourth of March of this year, I have been publishing in my Volksbiibleiothek, or "Popular Library," the works of HENRY HEINE in the original text, and in weekly numbers. With this number, I begin the publication of what I believe to be a trans- lation of extraordinary merit, of the Reiselfider, or Pictures of Travel by HEINE.

CHARLES G. LELAND, Esq., the talented translator of the Pictures of Travel is already known to our literary public by his varied contri- butions to literature. It is indeed, only possible for one who is him- self inspired with poetry, to comprehend the spirit of a poet, and to render it worthily in another tongue.

HEINE, as the founder of a new school of poetry, and as the most brilliant star in the firmament of living German writers, deserves the first place in this series. Should his Pictures of Travel prove accept- able to the American public, both writer and publisher will gladly continue their efforts by translating all the remaining works of this most remarkable of modern poets.

A single number of the Pictures of Travel, of about one hundred pages, will appear once a month at the extremely moderate price of Twenty-five cents. I venture to speak confidently of the cheapness of the work, as it is intended that its typographical execution and paper shall fully correspond to the literary merit of its contents.

All newspapers giving a full editorial notice of the Pictures of Travel, will receive a copy gratis. A liberal discount to booksellers and agents. The prospectus and other advertisements relative to the work will be sent wherever requested.
