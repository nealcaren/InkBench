Dr. Moreau's letter of December 20th, 1921
Translation of:

Dear Mrs. Catt:-

I did not repty immediately to your last letter because
I wished to send you several inquiries on the steps we have taken with our
government.

We have obtained copy of the telegram sent by Dr. Le Breton
Argentine Minister to Washington, since ours sent to our government by the
United States Legation here. In both communications it is established
that the Congress is not official and that consequently the delegates
cannot be official.

We are awaiting the response that our Government will
make to the demand that we have made to aid us in bearing the expenses of
the delegation, because the $500., of which the note of the Secretary of
the United States speaks, is absolutely insufficient, as the price of the

passage
alone is a little less than $450. We would like to know whether
each delegation is expected to bear its hotel and transportation expenses
in the United States.

I hope that we shall obtain the support of the government;
we shall communicate the result to you immediately.

I urge that we may receive as soon as it is possible
a]] publicity that you may have on the Congress, in order that the names
of other South American delegates may be published in our press.

In my next letter I will tell you whether I can go
myself to the Congress, as it is my greatest desire to do so.

I hope to have soon the pleasure of seeing you; and
in the meantime accept the expression of 17 best wishes,

Alice Moreau
