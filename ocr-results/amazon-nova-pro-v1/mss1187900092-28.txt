Dear Grandfa-

I have learned with much surprise that you are still in the city of Washington enjoying an extended leave of absence from your post of duty. I am very glad that such a leave has been granted you, and know that you are far happier no other place you can go and I only wish that matter could be so arranged as to allow you to remain in this
