T HE question for our consideration is whether the department of Election Laws and Methods is sufficiently important to make it a part of the work of the League of Women Voters.  It may at this moment be less appealing to many women, but for that very reason it is more necessary that women voters comprehend its need.  If any other department of the League; should be dropped, for example, Women in Industry, Social Hygiene, Child Welfare, other organizations would be responsible for the necessary work to be done, as they were before these departments were adopted by the League of Women Voters, but the work in this department of women to take it up.  If we had been enfranchised twenty years earlier at least, that is not much to talk about.  The reason why we are not enfranchised long before some interest in the work we rarely functions in this country, and it does not rear fruit anywhere and why it does not function at any time is sufficient to delay normal progress in a government such as ours.

Controlling Groups

A small group of people determined to oppose proposed legislation, if provided with money, may be like brewers distillers who money and prevent mass action, even though action people may make controlling contributions to political and return secure promises of no action in that power.  All parties is, therefore, party, down to the most rural election district chairman, to Why railroads fighting ratification in Tennessee? Certainly not because railroads cared whether or not women voted. Their interest was in women's association.  There was no reason to fight ratification.  It was be- quite disconnected, cause of any of the lobbies would be expectation that some of them would combined in support of their own pro-

THE QUESTION MADE BY MRS. CATT AT THE CLEVELAND CONVENTION OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS WHEN, AT HER SUGGESTION, THE COMMITTEE ON ELECTION-LAWS AND METHODS WAS ELEVATED TO A DEPARTMENT OF WORK CALLED "EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT."  THIS SPEECH WAS FELT TO BE SO FINE AN EXPRESSION OF THE FAILURE OF OUR GOVERNMENTAL MACHINERY TO REGISTER THE PEOPLE'S WISHES THAT IT HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR BY OUR READERS.

gram when necessity arose.  The combination of these lobbies against suffrage happened over and over again.  Presumably the program that again united their interests, but many other interests united in its support.

There is also the automatic system of what is known as the boss system to be watched.  In one of the states which did ratify there were six men charged with being owned solely by a political boss and they boldly and frankly said that they would not vote for ratification or yet against it until they had what they wanted; they did not tell any one their orders from their boss.  This boss refused to give orders because he said if he did so these men would expect if they returned cost him a good deal of money and would prevent his retirement from politics and the desired day for his retirement.  he refused as soon as be desired, so did six men awaited the order that these never wanted them lost the ratification because they had not sense enough to know what they wanted in a system such as this.

A system in this country for taking the vote of electors had be worked out.  It has been from decades to improve the methods, but there are pitfalls for honest and voters in almost every department of election from the taking of the vote before the result is known by the vote must be a perfectly controllable revolution in the of taking the vote, changing methods, making the platforms, and securing the legislation for election in the found impossible even for the most skillful and dry men and the League of Nations Republican in the League of Nations and dry enforcement.  And Irish Democrat in New York who wanted to go against the League of Nations and also against dry enforcement found the same difficulty.

THESE WERE TWO QUESTIONS ONLY IN THAT CAMPAIGN AND THERE WERE MANY OTHERS. SO DIFFICULT WAS IT FOR WOMEN TO REGISTER THE OPINIONS THEY WANTED TO EXPRESS IN THAT ELECTION THAT VERY MANY OF THEM FELT THE VOTE WOULD NEVER BE OF ANY VALUE TO THEM.  WHAT HAPPENED THEN, HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, BECAUSE THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE AND BOSSES DO MUCH POLITICAL JUGGLING OVER ISSUES.

IT IS NEEDED ALL ALONG THE LINE. THEREFORE, IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE DOG-CATCHER IN THE SMALLEST VILLAGE.

Where We Need Reform

Perhaps we need it most in our platform-making.  Parties are a country governed by meetings.  Ours is a form of trem- endous power in this land, so tremendous that they can give in the order whether a shall be carried or rejected, and the obedient electors walk up to the polist polls and defeat or support sure, sure plat- forms are made.  Party loyality voters who have interest in them and to say about issues to be included.  Party loyalty is relied upon to carry the ticket platform to the platforms and party loyalty usually successfully accom- plishes aim by the managers.  Progress is being made toward re- form; every decade witnesses improve- ment.  But we witness in improve- ing nation among world's nations must not only look to the method of registering the opinions of the who is now paid, but more earnest attention must be paid to the education of the people in the issues that are properly to be decided at the polls.

Therefore the Committee on Election Laws and Methods shall be dropped and that Elections Committee, which is a more inclusive term than Election and Methods, be made : chief department of the National League Women Voters.  That is, the committee would magnify and emphasize political work.

There are three main reasons for thi
