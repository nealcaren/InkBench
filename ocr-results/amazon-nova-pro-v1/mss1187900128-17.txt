I know not where to find justice for them, appeal to your judgement,
I have ever been friendly to the Colored Race, having lived many
years at Cape Haytian on the
Island of Hayti, when my husband
hood a government commercial house,
under the name of Wilson Laroche too, we are well known to the present
President of Hayti for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee, for the house of Gillm, Laroche
& co, Mr Gillm was also know
for the United States, and the
recognition of Hayti was effected
be him. I am find his record
in the State Department,
as so kind as to write for us to
influence public opinion on the
favor of the colored people
Beging you to excuse me for
addressing you I remain your Respectfully (illegible)
Frances G. Wilson
