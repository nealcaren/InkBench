tempt has been made to start a similar	
co-operative delivery system in Cleve-	
land, Ohio. Numerous other attempts	
are being made to solve the problem of	
distributors' spread. In Cincinnati, for	
example, the farmers have formed a co-	
operative association and are building up	
to the housewife's door. In other milk

munities farmers are also working out	
short cuts of their own.

Third Assembly is very likely taken, a	
date for the regular meeting of the Ad-	
visory Committee on Traffic in Women	
and Children was advanced by several	
weeks. And it was to this meeting that	
our American representative. Miss Grace	
Abbott of the Children's Bureau, went	
as "unofficial observer" of the action of	
the full Committee as that was just now given out.	
This information has just the fullest possible	
consideration which, after much discus-	
sion, was finally adopted. In this dis-	
cussion two other important points were	
raised and were finally crystallized into	
resolutions. One was a recommenda-	
tion for a questionnaire be sent to all	
members of the League asking them to	
state that a system of regulation	
for and report on its working and results,	
and those that have abolished it for a	
full statement of the reasons that led	
them to do so. The other urges the	
use of women police in dealing with	
"inofficial observer" from the Coun-
prostitution. the proposal made by	
But, says the report, particular im-	
portance attaches to that resolution of	
which embodies the proposal made by the	
United States.

The unofficial observer from the Coun-	
cil might. without delay, appoint ex-	
perts to make, in collaboration with ex-	
peres from all the countries con-	
cerned, a comprehensive study of the	
conditions under which this traffic goes	
on. and the methods practiced and the main	
procedure to be used. Light is to be	
thrown upon this darkest spot in our so-	
cial organization. It is hardly credible	
that, when the full facts are laid out	
for the world's inspection, governments	
will not be stirred to some positive action against some	
and people who are not a fraction as positive stirrer to this, and	
when these resolutions of the Advis-	
lory Committee have passed through the	ory business.	
necessary to the various national legis-	
latures for their enforcement adequate leg-	
islation for the enforcement must then	
be passed. And when that is done, as	
said at the end of the debate, the greatest blow ever	
dealt at the traffic will have been struck.	
Third Assembly, the discussion in the

Many women-and men, too, of	
course-who have no one dependent on	
them and wish to provide themselves	
with savings from one to receive an	
income in the future, find the purchase	
of income bonds one of the safest meth-	
ods of assuring this. The purchaser	
makes annual payments until a certain	
age, after which her fixed insurance com-	
pany pays her a fixed amount monthly	
for the rest of her life. Should she	
die before reaching this age, the in-	
surance company usually agrees to re-	deposit 
turn to the heirs the total amount of	
payments which the policy holder has	
made into the company's fund, not	reaching 
even if the purchaser dies after having	
reached the stipulated age and received	
some of the income payments, if the	
aggregate equal to the entire amount	
deposited as premiums, the difference	
is usually returned to the heirs.

The cost of income bonds varies	
greatly, according to the age at which	
payments are to begin. As a per-	
son thirty years of age, who wishes to	
receive ten dollars monthly beginning	
at the age of sixty, would pay an an-	
nual premium of about $34.14, and the	
same amount for each additional ten	
dollars of income desired. Should she	
wish the income to begin at the age	
of fifty the annual premium would be	
about $82.36. Disregarding the fact	
that twenty or thirty years can be	income 
received after that period amounts to a	
little over 7 per cent. on the accumu-	
lated deposits in the latter case, and	
approximately 11 1/2 per cent. in the	
former case. The profit to the insur-	
ance company. of course, lies in the	
fact that interest on the money as it is	
accumulating during the twenty' or	
fifty year period is not paid out. but	
goes into the company's fund. From this	
a business man's point of view, this	
makes the interest received on the	
money in the form of income after the	
age of fifty or sixty represent only	
about one-half the interest rate capital-	
ized above, as during this time the capital	
has had a chance to increase 50 per cent.	is 100 

The compensation for	
that lower margin lies in protection	
against making a bad investment and	
in the guarantee of systematic saving.

The retirement annuity bond operates	
on the same principle and is practically	
the same thing. though differentially	
named. The premium unit for women	
is $105 a month. This would provide for	
a woman of thirty a retirement annuity	
at $135.50 a month and of $30.71 a	
year at the age of fifty.
