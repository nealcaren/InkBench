in my place.  I've thought of a young friend who might
do: a little bright pretty young American lady,
whom - she has lately seen me, - that her health and
looks are failing very perceptibly, & who may (I think)
be glad to be of advantage to herself by earning
money.  She is Miss E-- (I've lost the name, but
may inquire and find it for thee, when thou writes.)  She
is about 24, I think, pretty fair-haired, good-
tempered, - rather sentimental and inexperienced. She
would look well - as thee might say of a servant girl.
She has lived (I am told) with friends - never with
hirelings.  I've offered to present her to thee at
some early day.  (I know thou'lt pardon me).  If her
appearance is satisfactory to thee, I suppose,
thou can inquire into her qualifications.  There's
no haste, however in regard to her employment.  I
have been ill with a chill & fever, but feeling much
better to-day, I sit down to try to answer thy last
letter, which I have carried about with me since its reception.
I'm a most thankful person.  I can get on
without all the things I used to enjoy so much.  But
there are some things without which I can't get on.  Those
things are, good health, time, and friends. (So at least
I've taught myself to speak, and to believe.)  Oh! I do cling to
health, when I have it; and I do crave time for my own doings;
and friends seem precious to me.  To me it seems as if the more
I lose of my friends and acquaintances, the less I want
of the "general public" - but the more I want of those who are
bound to me with bonds of affection and affection's
sympathy.  A pretty "foolish" young thing has turned up before
my eyes - who is - as a young pupil should be, -
green and has an pretty good disposition; but
comes hither with a slight English twang in her "I close
de-doons" for "I've done" the
door."  - Come, come - say I. thou
art getting too careful
only she talks broken English
yet - dull. I have made
a list for her.  Send the lot
and yours.  I cut a slip
out if the money paints
to Olivia Myers in will
send it at once. Give
much of fifty years - dear friend!
