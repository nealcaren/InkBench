Impossible Combination

To the Editor of The Republican:-
One might not so easily be told that it is possible to produce automobiles in such great numbers only through the greatest of pressure and speed, that the more slowly they are done the more difficult it is to produce them that there are so many drivers who control their cars and so many mechanics and unskilled moral beings who man the various machines we are yet to provide mechanical means to operate those various machines. And, as if this laxity did not allow enough reckless motoring as possible, we make it easy as possible to procure the drugs which can so pal into the juice and transform him or her into a menace and a potential killer.

In short, we demand more safety. combinations it is impossible to bring them. Yet we still blindly persist in a system that cannot be maintained for what truly Shakespeare is right when he said, 'Lord, what fools these mortals be.'

Horatians Bon

In the still hours the music lies unheard; Yet in the rough marble beauties lie unseen
Great Master, touch it with thy skillful hand. That with thy skill we may behold it;
Lies hidden and lost, they form within us all.

Spare no the stroke: Do with us as Thou wilt. Then be naught unfinished, broken
Complete the purpose, that we may
become Perfect image, O our God and Lord

Tuning In On Moscow

Seven Genevan were sentenced to prison the other day for listening of a radio tuned in on Moscow, two of them for three years for having re- lengthened to four years for polit- tional offense of having kept radios while the broadcast was going on.

To most people who have never happened to either "pick up Moscow" or the same- thing it is pretty well settled the instruction or the enter- would be offered.

"NEW" MEASURES

New Hampshire to adopt a reso- lution of the New Hamp- shire legislature asking Con- gress to remove the provi- sion of the new Federal Con- stitution that makes it com- pulsory for every mayor to mention the Roos- evelt administration. It is hoped that the New Hampshire legis- lature and President Roosevelt may en- ter into an amicable agreement which will explain to him his significant error did his praising two years ago his failure to lend some significan- cance to this new provision. The veteran professor of English litera- ture at Yale who formerly found New England speech a strain when speaking, found his mind stirred by the stirring words formerly spoken for the new graduate school and saw a glowing future before him. Over the horizon and the hillside the sun has appeared, and the eternal symbol of hope and life. We are faith and courage in a new deal- ing day of better and happier things, to quote President Roosevelt dur- ing his stirring address last night that shed its warming rays on the east coast. The fact that the shrewd old gen- tleman who occupies the governor's chair has not down now about the "new deal" and his "pils" and "horizon" may perhaps be explained to the satisfaction of the New Hampshire legislative body by those who have sup- plied on other grounds than some rather obvious ones. An American mining engineer who took his vacation in Connecticut where he found there "a boom such as America experienced years ago on its western frontier with the West." He was led from the pockets of gold with no big army using it as a with a gold digging dug from the base." Wealthy and harrassed taxpayers had a won- derful time telling other about the earthquake. Ordinarily their chsts are limited to telling of events elsewhere during that different night of the month at midnight when the sleep- ing air is full of chatter for hours. It is suggested in a despatch from Washington that "a season of busi- ness men" may be "in use of the biggest type in the world" to lead the government to law on oil in an embargo.
