Dear Mr Bougloss

It is a very long
time since we have written to
you or heard from you, and
write now in hopes of pro-
voking a reply.  We really are
anxious much in the dark about
you, & don't know whether
you still hold office under the
government, as we have not heard
to the contrary.  I conclude that you
do-, & therefore that you have not-
been lecturing, holding meetings
over the country this last- winter
as I of old.  Hope that your health
is good- & that your can report
will of yourself of your family.
