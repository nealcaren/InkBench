Dear Miss Blackwell,

I am blessed with a
propensity to be always at something you
are something still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three succes s in
sprites might tempt a les reasonable
creature to do.

The truth is hot hot beyond
creed, to say nothing of dead. What resource she
was left but you. The other evening so r so were
spoken of to me as having done this and that
as nurse in the war, & I was called on to admuse
her. I had to say, yes I admire what she did.
But must she not be a noble woman to do
so much. Then I said ito my will for we
you and she & I, to done good. Bo the
only recommendation we can have. Bul really
I look to see one who need no creed to
recommend him. seeing whom one thinks
not how much he has done & can do, but how
much he is.

I appencent was talking Greek,
without further, but you who under stand
Greek, is this really so minutellijibl?
