affair most deeply affecting the national welfare and common
defence, and has subjected itself to the severest enforcement of
those legislative and military powers, to which alone, under
the constitution, the people must look to save themselves
from ruin. In the last extremity of our contest, the ques-
tion must be decided whether slavery shall be rooted up
and extirpated, or our beloved country be torn asunder and
and extirpated, or our beloved country be torn asunder and
and conquerors, our Union destroyed, and our people
given up to our conquerors, our Union destroyed, and our people
given up to our conquerors rights of property, or any claims, which
dishonored? Are any rights of property, or any claims, which
one person can assume to have over another, by whatever local
law they may be sanctioned, to be held, by any just construction of
the constitution as superior to the nation's right of self-defence ?
And can the local usages or law of any section of this country
override and break down the obligation of the people to maintain
and perpetuate their own government ? Slavcry is no longer local


or domestic after it has become an engine of war. The
country demands, at the hands of Congress and of the President, the exercise of every power they can lawfully put forth for its
destruction, not as an object of the war, But as a means of termi-
nating the rebellion, if by destroying slavery the republic may be saved. These considerations and others have led the author to the conclusion stated in the following pagas, "that Congress has the right to abolish slavery, when in time of war, its abolh- ment is necessary to aid the commandor-in-chief in maintaining the 'common defence.'"
