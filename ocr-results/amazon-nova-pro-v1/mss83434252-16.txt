AS A SOLDIER.
year, President Lincoln was authorized to accept ne-
groes for any service.  About a month later, the Sec-
retary of War, for the first time, authorized the rais-
ing of negro troops, by directing General Rufus Sax-
ton to arm, uniform, equip and receive into the serv-
ice of the United States such numbers of volunteers
of African descent as he might deem expedient, not
exceeding five thousand, and to detail officers to in-
struct and command them.  In September, the Union
victory at Antietam so strengthened the administra-
tion that the President at once issued his prelimi-
nary Emancipation, which was to go into effect Jan-
uary 1, 1863; and after that step all logical objec-
tion to using the negroes as a military factor ceased.
On January 1, 1863 (now just fifty years ago), President Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation, and the project of making use of the negroes as soldiers was then considered more favor- ably; but not until the 22d of May following was the Bureau of Colored Troops established in the War Department. The tide then fully turned, for the
government itself undertook the work of recruiting
and organizing the new military force.
