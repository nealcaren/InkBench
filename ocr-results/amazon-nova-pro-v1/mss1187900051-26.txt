Friend Douglass

I started from Rochester yesterday morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake
Tonight at 6 oclock I was in the swamp
holes a few north of the Rush Reservoir--

wire and communicated with the person
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your postal card, Before I left home I read your telegram, went to the Rock. Sav. Bk. where the oft was procured and notified them of its new reception, and, if you wish for a duplicate, They said that they could not give another one till they had received their aft from the Clearing house at N. Y. which will be the first week
