[March 18, 1891.]
My dear friends -
Mr, (Charlotte and T,]
congratulate you upon your safe
arrival back Ho Washington.
Charlotte is Gojoining in Navickers
for a few weeks. Mr. Nomm re-
mains at New Havn. Mrs. No.
comes frequently to pass the day
with me and I return the
visit. She suggested my writing
to you. writing has become
quite a burthinsome to her as she
is as feeble seemingly like Hultle-
down. But that she has improved
since her arrival on the Island
is clearly evident. She did not
think of walking out at all
when I was in New Vask now,
she does mon more walking than
984
