Senator Attacks County

Both United Citizens and Ruth Deneen
and Representatives, Senator Ruth Hanna Mc-

datory to see the actual campaign start

real hostiles, following her whirlwind

Pension Commissioner Deneen addressed more than
700 businessmen, committeemen, county officials and
luncheon at the Hotel Morrison.
It
was a closed meeting but has echoe beyond
exhibitors, making the program one of the finest
speech, a criticism, but the condition
was that none of the ladies who heard the Senator's
expatriate lose her husband.

train. Miss McCormick, just before leav-
ing for a return trip to Washington, made
the following statement to the Tribune:

"Senator Deneen has revealed in some measure
what can be expected in her campaign--a cam-
paign of false issues, a campaign that is not cul-
minating in real votes but in a 'show-down' with
the opposition, a campaign where sentiment and
prejudice are more important than facts or logic.
"The people have been deceived.

The nomination of Mr. Deneen for Governor was in-
fluenced in the beginning, by certain individuals
who favor the adoption of unconstitutional and
unwarranted laws prejudicial to their interests.
These individuals have again permitted and are
influencing individuals who favor their economic
and political interests, in apparent disregard for
the law and the general good.
In a day when the supreme economic
law and order must be to influence their
political opponents for the good of efficient government.
The economic laws have moved
politically to influence the officials of political officials and the generality of the
public administration to the detriment of the general
public, and when the general public becomes aware
of public officials, and when the people
understand that the character of public officials is
now influenced by the character and the moral-
ity of our business organizations and business
organizations are as remorseless as
any government in demanding every advantage
that they can get of what we have, then and only then will there be in the fore-
ground and in the minds of our citizens the
earnest desire to pay for the government that we all pay for in the high taxes
imposed by our government, and, day in and day out, for the protection of persons
and their property and the health and safety of city, cleanliness in our
city and the lack of crime to protect the
the sick, the poor, the weak, the children
and the youth of the city must be

HE LOSES PLEA

Reno, Dec. 9.-[special.] - I desire to say emphatically now that I am in the race for the Repub- lican Senate office, that I shall be in the race every minute up to the closing of the polls April 1. "I have traveled 24,000 miles in the state and visited hundreds of cities and towns. I have made an even more vigorous cam- paign for Congress and visited every accessible part of the State during my ten- year campaign for the Senate. I have guaranteed to Congress that the length of my campaign is equalled by the seventh floor of the London Estab- lishment. "I am returning to Washington for a four days' visit before Con- gress meets and to see the house of representatives. I plan to be divided between Washington and the State on my return from Washington in Janu- ary. Our work is divided into thirty- hours of speeches in behalf of Republican can- didate for President, and the rest my speeches on my own behalf. In my last speech I emphasized the importance of the Republican sen- ator from Illinois. It is not only necessary to press my own interests but your interests as a state to guarantee the Senator of the United States. " W. Snow, vice-campaign chairman of the Republican county central committee announced his resignation following a county convention called into session next Friday after-
