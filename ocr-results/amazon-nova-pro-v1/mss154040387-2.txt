A CALL TO ACTION by CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT. A speech made at A Memorial Hall Meeting in Cleveland. April 13, 1921 Memorial speech schedules one on Politics There is not an audience in this country nor in any other one in all the world where an appeal for peace does not stir the hearts of the people. There is not an audience before which a speaker may allude to international peace that does not respond. There is not anyone in all the world who is willing to say that he wants another war. There is not anybody who does not want peace, but how are we going to get it? That is the practical question, and it is not only a question for us to decide in our own country, but in our own states and cities, before we can act collectively with other nations, but it is for our- selves individually to think our way through.

We don't settle that question when we have a million different points of view, but wait for someone careful about being non-par- tisian. Everybody at this time is extreme about being non-partisan. I am for this. I don't care a rap about parties. I am for a Republican Disarmament. I was for a Democratic League of Nations. I am for a Re- publican. I believe in taking action on questions one or any other kind. I believe in taking action on questions of this kind and not waiting too long. It does not matter what party is in or who is President. Our country is not judged as a nation. Its parties is judged as a nation.

Today there isn't anybody in the world who knows what we are going to do: nobody in any other nation and nobody in this nation knows what we are going to do. But I ask you if there is anybody anywhere at this moment with an earnest crusading spirit to lead in this matter. Oh. no! campaigning to arouse the greatest question which was ever presented to the nations of the world. We are as stolid and indifferent apparently, and as inactive as though there was not before us this greatest question. It was this psychology that is upon our nation. We have always been a nation in favor of ablation. We have signed as a nation that signed the first treaty of that character. We are leaders in it. We are believers in war as a nation. We We don't believe in War as a nation in the ideal of the are peaceful people, and we are believers in the ideal of the are voice of the people, settling questions and not force. Well, then, we are the appointed ones to lead in this question.
