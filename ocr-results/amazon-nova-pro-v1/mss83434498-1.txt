We are now seizing this fort which is the main entrance to MOBILE. We first invested the fort the 27th last month, and have been here ever since. We have not lost many yet, killed and wounded is all of the regiment. There is not over 6 men yet, killed and 15 wounded. FORT BLAKELLY, that is invested by steel, with 15,000 negroe troops. The rebels have a perfect hatred to them, therefore they came out nine and made there rear guard within a mile by fours to all of the negroe on the line. Our rifle pits are with four (or five) different charges to our rifles. Their regiment is the closest to that of any, therefore we raise them each time. Our 13 rods of the regiment is increasing, trying to cut off their communication with mobile. Much more excellent content, talks about how they are encouraging the rebels to cut the breast works, they are planting some big 100 lb. parrot guns, the rebels have sunk 3 in the channel which have sunk 2 of their gunboats, the rebels have also sunk in the ground some torpedoes which have killed a number of them when the bold hand pulled them. (the foreeather of the land storm) written in a very neat ground hand, nice content concerning BLACK TROUPS and the TORPRODO lin galler.
