Dear Mr. Chapman Latt:

I just finished the superb book "on the Great Work" you have accomplished during your wonderfuly active life! 

This book is a great inspiration for all of us in every country. I was deeply moved by the pages on your international work and the meetings influenced few of which I was fortunate enough   to attend.
