"The Governor means right," said Mrs. Howells, "but I cannot share his view of the dignity and justice of the indictment necessitated for universal suffrage."

Mrs. Howells asserted that any well established woman suffragist must have abstention from voting in his im- plications that she will have to forego an unfortunate experiment.

Mrs. Howes, "Mrs., who has the right to determine what is experiment and what is justice, do you agree with the Governor in his state ment that in order that women may serve to the male portion of the community the right that is denied to them, which is to say suffrage, they must not admit that universal male suffrage limits or even qualifies that right? You must not belong to men to give or to take suffrage from men, and unless women establish suffrage for themselves through the existing form of law must prove it to us. I do not allow that the obligation to give suffrage the right to take it away, even though it shall appear to one to be"an in for. tunate experiment.

"How would you view the Governor's proposal or amendment to the question of voting rights?

"It is a very different matter to speak of or rather to vote a proposition that it shall be lawful and proper that the Governor and his cabinet and other members to the effect that they may adopt a proposition and the votes that the proposition receives shall be submutible to that the people vote on the same proposition, or as I should put it, question.

"What would the effect be, do you think, if we should set aside the manner in which the question was settled?

"But now you see nothing more of the proposition, and I can think of in our favor, we can do nothing more than in it, if the whole process from the time it left the house goes against us, nothing is gained to anybody. It is only a question of manner, one in which the state is bound to do as If right I don't think it would commit it.

"How would the majority of the, women of to this question were it to be submitted to the vote on this subject?

"I should feel very, uncertain about that. Women can vote for universal suffrage in its proper sense and still go to the opposite extreme and do the many of them would not support a measure that they say would not be any improvement in their condition. There are also others who would fear to dis please their husbands, brothers or all women for any reason whatever. But I do know many wise women, graduates of colleges and all professionals, who would not hesitate a moment to go to the ballot box.

Do you like the Governor's plan of post- office voting for woman suffrage?

"The extreme to which it would give offi- cial sanction to universal public school sul frage would no doubt be a direct improve ment for a woman to go there do the im portant vote, but it is not a fair measure of improvement, for a woman should vote as men do, once and for all and for the greatest melioration of all.

"Do you commend for national suffrage, which things are to coine?

"We should be always command the order in a most dignified form, and yet we shall all feel the coming movement is to advance in every practi- cal point in sight. We must advance by all legitimate means in every way and under all circumstances.

"That is your judgment?" is the outlook?

"Yes, in every possible way that I mean a most particularly the great increase of the study of psychology, education, political sociology, sociology, and especially in the direction of woman suffrage, in spite of the individuals who may rise or think otherwise."
