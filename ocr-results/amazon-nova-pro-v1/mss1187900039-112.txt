Dear Father

Yours of the 4th inst. is just received I saw an account of one of your lecture in New
Jersey published in the N.Yark Tribune, and of thompleg
that you might have other appointments and hearing
from you. All are well except the baby, he has a wewer
and Origuesta is attending him, we are afraid he
will have the crope; but he is not to land wish to bother
your mind about the affair between Mathew, Ind. and my
self I know your mind, and time is little overpriced. you
may know the cause of the difficulty, but know you dont
know the whole truth and it is hard to find it out under
the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone
against us, Ilook for another war. If you will be at home
any length of time I will write again soon, and I am
very busy just now. Libbie would send love if she knew
T was writing Love to mother and all.

Your aff lev.
