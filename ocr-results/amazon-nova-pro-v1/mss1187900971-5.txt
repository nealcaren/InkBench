Grandpa was never called "Lloyd".   He was first Fred.   The slave changed to Johnson when he ran away and because the man in whose home he lived in called Fred was named Johnson, this man who had finished reading "The Lady of the Lake" admired so much the character with the book named "Deugless" asked Grandpa to keep from confusing their two Johnson names, that he would like to call himself Deugless and in stead of Johnson.  Grandpa told him one name to win was as good as another and hence - forth set out to be called Frederich Deugless.  These facts - not hearsay.

Later just rec'd. letter from Fred - he leaves on his "debating tour" today - and rarely debates at Howard.   He met stop with Era.   (we already millet foe's wife Emaxie and Aunt Crawford)
