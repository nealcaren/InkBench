Her father, Henry B. Blackwell, was an abolitionist and practically the only man who really de voted his life to obtaining equal rights for women. Miss Blackwell's aunts, Elizabeth Blackwell and Antoinette Brown Blackwell were distinguished workers for suffrage and in philanthropy as well, the first woman to be ordained a minister. Antoinette Brown Blackwell was the first woman, and another, Antoinette Brown Blackwell was the first woman to be ordained a minister. Antoinette Brown Blackwell joined her parents in working for suffrage and in publishing the Woman s Journal, until 1917 when, carrying the suffrage banner alone after their death for years she prepared annually the Woman Citizen. For many years Massachusetts Legislature considered her hads the ablest presentations of controversial matter he ever heard. It was also Miss Blackwell who brought the two parties of the suffrage movement, whose estrangement weakened their effectiveness, together into the Na tional American Woman Suffrage Association, of which she was secretary for nearly 20 years. For years she has been a trustee of Boston University and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
