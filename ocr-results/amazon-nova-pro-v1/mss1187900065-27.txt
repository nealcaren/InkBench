PRESERVITION OF CHUTEITY IN ANIMALS

Headquarter Fourth Avenue cr. 22ND Street.

New York f anuary 26, 1895

To - The Probate Judge of ?Hudson County, N.Y.

Sir, I inclose herewith the last Will
and Testament of Miss Ottilia asing, who died,
as I am informed in the City of Paris, France, August
24 1894. I have decided not to offer the same for
Probate, because I do not propose to qualify as Executor

but, in view of the fact of other persons having interests
in the estate under the Will in question, I deem it my
duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no
obstacle to your entertaining an application for ad-
ministration on the estate, with the Will annexed.

Ibeg also, however, that it is the intention of
the American Society for the Prevention of cruelty animals,
on the Cessation of the trusts mentioned in the Will,
to claim the property to which it is entitled

Have the honor to remain,
with greep respect

Henry Bergh
President.
