My dear Steady: I have h. thank you for two
letters and the notes and clippings concerning
Mrs Blinn I thank you especially/ for the clip-
pings for as you suspect, I am awerested
in her outgoing lach; year, in Buffalo, at the
National Convention: thork Mrs Sweet brought
a letter she had received from Effie Vance,
and she had described very nevidly how
Mrs. Blinn had been able to rise above her
supporting thro' Christian Science Since his-
tears flowed as she read it, and she was no
great admirer of Mrs. B. Heelin she told
me that E. Vance was also pelling her
estid in Ch. Sei. Mrs. B. mas one of the most
generous and forgiving natures I even
met, and allhs she also had her mistakes
of character, as we to the reft fos, she mus
a woman to be admired for my many
estimable qualities.
