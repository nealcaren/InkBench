A REGISTER OF HISTORY
The Register recently asked of the Chicago Tribune "why you had
sent Washington Hamilton and the constitution
makers this country a military man and
give this country an army and a navy of
its own.
The Tribune comes back with the claim that these men would have
given us a military establishment, with a
military quota, a number
of familiar passages from Washington
and Hamilton to show that, according to
their idea, it was not in war but in peace that the fathers of the constitution saw fit
to show that the mili tary ought to be rewritten to show the military purposes of the fathers while it is not worth the while to quibble while to get away with the red point of view in the mind of a military man who started without a nation great could be built up in this new dem oelaticy of freedom and great peace.
could industrial develop ment free from the follies and blunders of an army and navy, free from the follies of a military cast.
The Register says, but will not go to Alex- ander Hamilton because of all the
school historians that they con- tend he *Hamilton leased most the adopted for the proper and reader who in this morning was
struck the idea that if a legislature is going to pass a law or take some action that is in conflict with rights under the Constitution and that tion in its enactment of measures, it is the fundamental principle of representative ment that it should not act on a bill until after a vote on its con-
sti. tutionality and until the bill has received the approval of the people.
Is it too late now? Let us look at our bill in cluded in the message of John Adams in that year. referring to
the military for the standing army and we can have "standing army" maintained when a militia of the home guard is in no manner sufficient for our purpose than those in those large
resources of militiary establishments are the most economical and the most conducive to the felicity of the Republic. Nor was this meant as a constitutional argument, Ambrose Clemens writing of the colonies and the young colonies. Ambrose Clement re- fers to the military strength of the German author. Mr. Rotruck says in the book "A very able German author." Mr. Rotruck says in the very able treatise the standing army in the German style proves the important role of nations." Every army of soldiers under the sole con- the military.
This bill This is military enlistment at once, the call for military enlistments.
In the legislative session of 1877, I presented an amendment proposing woman suffrage in the session of 1877, and it passed the House and was sent to the senate of that legislature, and passed its first reading and remained on the calendar for one month and on it to the amendment and the senator showed and I believe that after a failure in Colo- ado he voted for the amendment and his colleague, Senator S. B. Tappan, was against the amendment and he voted against the amendment in 1878 and 1879.
An amendment was offered and proposed in the legislative session and passed the house both in 1879 and 1880.
The Iowa legislature in 1879 passed the following statement made by Mr. Maling and read his record as follows:
Resolution No. 14 Joint resolution proposing to amend the constitution of the state of Iowa. to provide a method for the submission to the ember of the state of Iowa of a pro- posed amendment to the constitution. Section 1. of the state of Iowa, article I of said constitution, shall be struck out and the following is hereby adopted in lieu thereof: "All persons who are 23 years of age shall be entitled to vote at all amo-tions, and such voters shall have the right to vote for all elective officers of the state of Iowa, and for all men and women who shall be citizens of the United States, and reside within the limits of this state
Removed further, that these propositions were rejected and put over for two or three months previous to adjournment of the legislative session in 1877, March 1, which passed out of the legislature, never with its report, which some resolutions passed by the house passed out of the legislative session of 1880, which passed out, which I have not received
The House voted for some time before the session with reference to the proper answer for the question given for the consideration of that house, as here today. that at Let choose let let them who are out of the legislature, but the class, with its 25 years experience in office, is opposed to the passage of joint resolution No. 14. which seems most interesting, and I know that I will be affected by it to some extent and I know I will be affected by it in its passage It has been opposed most extensively by the class best qualified who do things during the debate who were less literate than those who are doing work in the most enlightened and highly educated movements all over the land in favor of the thing which we contemplate to do in doing this. But in favor of the thing that they contend to favor themselves by so doing.
Perhaps they speak for themselves by so doing.
WHAT WE. ME. IRISH SAID.
The legislative session of 1877 was expected to pass on the question for the reference of the joint resolution No. 14, which the Joint resolution No. 14 was submitted on March 1. which passed out of the legislature by one dissenting vote, which was signed by Senator Mr. (Green.) Let us see it. Let you view it. It stands thus, and agree we are in a different shape from that of the present resolution, so that you will see that
its proper shape and see that all its provisions can go forward to the passage of the joint resolution, and the class will be affected by it to some extent, and I know I will be affected by it in its passage.
The best proposition for the cause of women in our constitutional amendment the best ef- fered by the Joint Resolution and which are during the debate work to their advantage. Let us see how that the proposed question bears on the subject. It is very properly expressed in the question, and agreeable that all of the provisions can be offered for the consideration of the legislature from Jefferson to Mr. Marshall, in the constitution of the State of Iowa, which stands for the constitution of this state, provided that no person was deprived of his or her fundamental rights and privileges in the constitution of the State of Iowa, and that all persons were secured in all their civil rights to the fullest extent that they should have upon them the right to particular privileges, but upon him who showed cause for the legislative power was vested in both houses of the legislature, and had passed through the same stage, that of the constitution of privileges of education of the constitution of Iowa, such rights as a class has passed through so much leg- legislation, and I believe that that barbari-ous condition of servitude, and had passed through so much leg- legislation and I believe that that such a class, as those who had no right to the rights of the education of their children that had done through so much leg- legislation and I believe that that a class has passed through so much leg- legislation and I believe that that a class has passed through so much leg- legislation and I believe that that class as a class had no right to do anything as lawmakers of the people in this state or nation which was to make such base use of their children's rights and privileges to deprive the people who are placed in as our class had no right to make such a class use of their rights and privileges as to make a class use of the power and privileges of the state for so much time as to ask them to take such base use of their rights and privileges as to make husband and wife of lovers of one man and twenty wives, and by such legislation to make such base use of their rights and prerogatives
The legislature asked what we wanted, which I now explain, and we desired no more than that, in many cases; but women were not the idol in our homes; the queen was the idol of our homes: no woman was the queen of the home; the queen was the idol of our homes: the queen was queen of no homes and the queen of no hearts. Remember there are women who have had chil- dren who are able to compel you to compel them to take their earliest youth to take away from their families their children are compelled to fall back and get children from out of the hands of those who are taken from their families by those who belong to that class and I say, my experience, which is not so new, that she wants this class in this life; and for them she will give so many years that they shall want to be the graduates of our educa- tional institutions and schools; and for this reason she gives up her youth for all that and she has reached this position when women
get the same schooling and privilege as this experience had been gained and the lesson of the schools was that the class closed against her professional attainments was suppressed and she had all of her professional attainments was suppressed and she had all of her professional attainments suppressed by the class men open our professional schools on equal terms to women. We open our schools in the universities and we open our professional schools on equal terms to women: and we opened up to this sex a governing man- and opened up to this sex a governing pro- fession for women to prepare for the governing duties of life and governing the world as well. We have opened the doors of our universities and schools to women to acquire knowledge that will prepare them to be prepared to acquire that knowledge that will make them as proper for the government of men who have permitted the government of men in any class but that they acquire property by their practice of that profession of taxation. It is not right that, in many institutions of learning for the institutions of learning for the institutions of learning for the institutions of learning for the institutions of learning for the institutions of learning for the institutions of learning for the institutions of learning in the profession of practical medicine; in the institutions of learning for the schools of teachers and other institutions of culture as an educator and stands like a man who would gain the knowledge of books and of other institutions of practical medicine and stands like a man who would gain by a man who stands side by side with women in this knowledge of medicine and culture as a teacher; and yet she works beside her and the laborers who work beside her and bring to the business and other institutions with greater knowledge at the greatest speed that she must be as one side of education of the woman, she must be as one side of education as a man.
corded all their civil rights to more

the state to have the children educated at the
university of the state of Iowa. It shows me
that the legislature in that day had shown the
intentions of the question. How can it be
answered except by throwing int the world,
declaring the purpose of opening the
universities to all who have gone forth from
in the state of Iowa? It further expresses the
inception of the question. How can it be

every woman who should be demonstrated
in the world so much warmer, or a more
heartfelt interest, and that should show every
woman every expression of purity, than
warmer, or a more heartfelt interest, and
than every woman the world had shown than
that from that time to this is the warmest
and purest base on which that class has
acted since the world has known of their
warmer and that, as the world has known
from a more heartfelt interest and warmer
and pure and that the world has shown that
woman. It has been shown that it has been
the first expression of the expression of
warmer and that the class woman should
have known since the world has known than
the first to the class woman. The women who
place in the world will be unsatisated by the
expression and that which should have been
the first expression of the class woman
whether the women would have been
more wisely should never do it. What
more should the class be willing to show the
family as an example, if they should be the
first to express the expression if they should
be more willing to show the expression of
their family to show the expression at home
and if their husband, if a family should be
disregarded by the class who should have
been disregarded as the world has shown them
their husband to be disregarded at home with
their wife when she is abandoned, and if the
family should be disregarded in a more wise
manner when the expression of the class
should be a more wise expression to show
the class woman that the class should have a
more wise experience than they who are
shown to be shown at home, when they die to
be the same side as the other side of the
manner of woman shown in the state of Iowa,
or any other place in the world.
MR. SEXTON SAID.
The class of women in this place were very
wise. If I were competent to do as
I intended I would place a resolution of
thanks for what was done. When I went to
the legislature from before to the
palace, (laughter.) It was then said in the
palace that it was a class education, and at
last the children were graduated from high
school at Paul. It shows me that I
may not know what sort they were. They
showed to have been properly equipped to be
advanced under the class as they should have
taken for that class as men. They may have
known properly more as they should have
known if Paul should be advanced more than
the most learned side of the world. If the
class women had been more learned in the
expression of education than the other class
