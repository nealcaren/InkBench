and is expected to return
 soon,
I must close now I think
 after having given you news
 of a few of your friends who
 always remember and
 ask after you.
Madam Germain says she
 has written to you and has
 never received an answer.
My husband sends his best
 regards to you.
Yours
truly
Alice A. Batthis
