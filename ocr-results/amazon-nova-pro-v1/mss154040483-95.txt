'Party Clean-ups Are
the Crying Need'
Says 

Carrie Chapman Catt 

Distinguished Suffrage Leader 

ANTED, feminism in poli- tics. Emily Newell Blair says so. 
She believes that the women voters of both parties should be pessimistic and discouraged about women in politics. Her conclusions are drawn from seven years' experience as hard work as vice-chairman of the National Democratic Committee. 

She admits that women vote, sit in conventions and serve on committees, but instead of supporting independently their own ideas and policies, she charges that they have been widely maligned

A wide cry from women of all parties that they will no longer support a party that is dishonest, covers graft, or guaran- tees profit to certain of its men, would startle the nation and the world: it would awaken respect where it does not now exist, It would put the right kind of feminism into politics and take out the wrong kind. Instead of more women in office and more women effectively working in the par- ties, the great need is a crusade con- ducted by men and women workers alike against the positive wickedness of their parties and the wicked things that have been done up to date as much as they were on the
