EMANCIPATION AND COLONIZATION.

The city of Carmén has about 5,000 inhabitants; its aspect from the port is
very picturesque and beautiful. Mariners, on their entering, may be guided by a
fine fixed light in the Indian villages, which light can be seen fourteen miles at sea. The village opposite the place, which light can be
seen fourteen miles at sea. The village opposite the place, which light can be
logwood, the annual exportation of which is from four to six hun-
from Tabaneuy, Chiboja, Candelaria, Chumpan, the Ranchos
of the East, Palisada, and principally from all the ránchos on the river Usuma-
cinta, passing through Palisada. The interior of the country is generally swampy,
and its greatest production 10 *this day is logwood. There is also in the interior
of the country a large quantity of cedar, mahogany, and divers other kinds of
fine and valuable timber, especially for ship-building ; but, until now, they have
not been an object of great extraction or exportation.
There at present ten or twelve establishments for the elaboration of sugar
and aguardiente (sugar-cane rum), and with time these articles may be produced
in abundance for exportation.
What is now considered as the territory of Carmén has about 20,000
inhabitants.

If the country was more thickly peopled, so as to facilitate labor for agricul-
tural pursuits, it would probably be one of the richest tracts of country in the
world.

Steam communications could be established from Carmén to the rivers of
Palisada, Chumpan, Candelaria, Mamantel, and Caño de Tabaneuy, by deepen-
ing a little the bars of these rivers, which could be done without any great out-
lay, and with lucrative results to any one who would undertake the enterprise.

The distance by sea from Vera Cruz to Lagua is two hundred and seventy
miles; from Laguna to Fontera de Tabasco, by sea, forty-eight miles ; or to
San Juan Bautista one hundred and fourteen miles by sea and river.

| Yucatan was, under Spain, a captaincy general, distinct from the vice-royalty                           | of Mexico ; it was called the Intendancy of Merida. Humboldt, in his New Spain, vol. 2, p. 244, writes of the intendancy of Merida, in 1808, as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
