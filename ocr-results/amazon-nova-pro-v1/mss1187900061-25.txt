Washington,
D.C.

Dearer Douglass! I received your speech delivered at the recent
communication of Emerica
two in the District of Columbia
and was particularly satisfied
and pleased by your utterance,
and impressed at the vigorous
brilliancy of your power after
an almost constant defence
of them for nearly a half cen-
tury in the cause of our oppressed
-ed people.
