CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON ORGANISATION

133 WORLD BUILDING, NEW YORK

April 20th 1895

Dear Mr. Blackwell:-

I pondered over your letter and I cannot see my duty in the matter. If I thought you might think I could be of any particular aid in Utah I should go. I will try and feel the pulse of things there, a little more and then give a definite answer. I had hoped the conference would do the work. I did not think Miss Anthony could do it,but I relied upon the workers from Wyoming and Colorado; as I wrote you I began to feel worried about it myself, and I am not at all sure that I can understand the status of the question there. The reports in the newspapers are often times so garbled that it is impossible to tell what is the truth. We are greatly handicapped by not having any Genteles to write to. I am very sure I could never convert the Editor of the Salt Lake Tribune, if he is in truth opposed to it. A conversion must be a growth. I think it is almost impossible to make a friend out of an enemy. If you heard of anything that gives you any clue to the atus question I hope you will let me know. If it so happens that by my going there I could do good, I am sure I will very gladly go. I am,

Yours sincerely,
(Dictated).
