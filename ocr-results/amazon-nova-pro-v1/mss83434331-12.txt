Whereas, unconditional slavery exists to a fearful extent amongst us as a nation, in vio-
lation of those principles that moved our fathers to the fearful struggle of the Revolution--
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalien-
able rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
Whereas, the aristocracy of the South are determined to perpetuate it by means scarcely
less dreadful than the tortures of the Inquisition, and the [bastardl aristocracy of the north

speedy termination--and to act the more efficiently, form ourselves into a society and adopt

From the Cincinnati Gasctlc.
Some forty miles from Cincinnati, to the East, are two settlements of free negroes--probably
near a thousand--men, women and children, of the true ebony color . with a very little mix-
ture of the mahogany or lighter shades. Each family has a small farm. They are occupied by them,
without the power to sell. Each small negroe owns the land enaupied as slaves, and
these lands were purchased expressly for them, and parceled out among them about fifteen
years ago.


Their lands are not of the best quality of Ohio lands ; but, by good management could
be made very good--they are particularly well adapted to grass, The generated text has been blocked by our content filters.
