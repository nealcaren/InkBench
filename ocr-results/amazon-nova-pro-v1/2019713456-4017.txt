THE CAREER
OF THE
GOD-IDEA IN HISTORY.

BY HUDSON TUTTLE,
AUTHOR OF "ARCANA OF NATURE," "ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY
OF MAN," ETC.
Dwelling in the light that no man can approach unto. ... Canst thou
by searching find out God? ... Touching the Almighty, we cannot find
him out. -BIBLE.
Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
