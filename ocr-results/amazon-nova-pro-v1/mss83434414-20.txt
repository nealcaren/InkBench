Instructions were given to surgeons-in-chief to relieve the medical department of the army of the care of sick refugees and freedmen, and aid Assistant Commissioners in establishing hospitals for such patients as could not be otherwise properly accommodated, and employ the requisite number of physicians and attendants to supply the wants of the sick.

It was soon discovered that the want of congressional appropriation, and the limited amount of funds at the disposal of the Commissioner for the employment of physicians and attendants for the sick, would embarrass the administration of the medical department.

The Surgeon General having authorized, in Circular No. 5, current series, medical purveyors to issue to the bureau medical and hospital supplies in accordance with the standard supply table which I had prepared and the Commissioner adopted for the use of refugees and freedmen, surgeons-in-chief of districts were approving officers for such requisitions. They were directed to make to the chief medical officer of the bureau at Washington consolidated. dated sick reports of their districts weekly, and promptly transmit the monthly reports, to- gether with a copy of all other reports made, contracts made and annulled, circulars and orders issued and requisitions approved.

Medical officers having charge of medical and hospital supplies were required to make quarterly and when relieved therefrom, property returns, according to form, to the chief medical officer of the bureau.

Previous to the organization of the bureau, as early as July 25, 1864, I was by order of Colonel R. O. Abbott, United States army, medical director, department of Washington, in addition to my other duties as surgeon in charge of Ricord hospital and member of the army medical board, assigned to the supervision of freedmen's affairs in the District of Columbia; and a complete relief system, both in hospital and quarters, was set at work without loss of time, being the means of furnishing to six thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine (6,929) patients medical attendance and medicines and subsistence was given to the absolutely destitute.

The first systematic efforts for the relief of freedmen rendered destitute by the rebellion were made under the auspices of Colonel John Eaton, jr., 63d U. S. C. T., now brevet brigadier general and Assistant Commissioner of this bureau for the District of Columbia, by the establishment of a contraband camp in West Tennessee, October, 1862, which proved to be the nucleus of the most extensive system in the country, including in its operations the great valley of the Mississippi, under the same officer, whose humane exertions gave assistance to over seventeen thousand persons. Elsewhere no systematic aid was afforded these people.

Although the bureau has not yet reached the remote sections of the south, already forty- two (42) hospitals with accommodations for our thousand five hundred (4,500) patients are in operation, and facilities are afforded for the treatment of five thousand (5,000) sick in twenty- four asylums and colonies established by the bureau; in attendance on the sick eighty-three physicians are employed under contract, and one hundred and eighty male and one hundred and seventy-seven female attendants. Of twelve regimental medical officers detailed to the bureau by department commanders, there remain but three. In this class might be men-
