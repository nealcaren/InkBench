EDITOR'S POR'TFOLIO.

We have received a number of let-
ters from young correspondents who
have been getting subscribers for us,
and getting at the same time handsome
prizes for themselves. (See page 3 of
cover). One little girl sent three sub-
scribers, and then sent her a nice silver
fruit-knife. She thought she would
like another to present to her dear
grandmother ; so she sent us three more,
and got another fruit-knife. Another
little girl wanted a croquet set, and so
sent us twenty full subscribers. Others
have got wallets, books, note-paper, &c.

Will our little readers help us to
establish " The Nursery" prosper-
ously by doing a similar work ?

FOR seven full subscribers we will
send one of the excellent Craig micro-
scopes with a prepared object-glass, all
ready for use.

Oscar Pletsch. — The well-known
critic of "The Boston Transcript," who
writes under the name of " Tom Folio "
says, -
.

" What Landseer is to dogs, what
Rosa Bonheur is to horses, what Mor-
land is to pigs, what Temiers is to
Dutch boors, Oscar Pletsch is to chil-
dren, — their painter, interpreter, im-
mortalizer. It has been said that
Pletsch has never had a superior, and
probably not an equal in his specialty
of sketching children. For presenting
the American public with the best draw-
ings of this admirable artist, Miss
Seaverns deserves the thanks of all
lovers of art. If you would obtain an
idea of Pletsch's genius. - his humor,
truth, geniality, and beauty, — get a set
of 'The Nursery.' If you are not charmed
with his designs, If you are not charmed
with his 'Keeping Shop," 'A Young
Hair-dresser,' 'The Professor,' 'A
Hard Day's Wash ' ' I've Been A-
Maying!' 'You Can't Come In,' 'The
Children's Auction ' 'A morning Call,'
'Cooking Dinner,' 'Getting Ready for
Breakfast' &c. &c. I advise you not to set
up for a connoisseur."

This admirable artist is now engaged
upon some designs made expressly for
" The Nursery," and which will appear in
our numbers for 1868. Three of Pletsch's
drawings appear in this number, as will
be seen by our Table of Contents.
