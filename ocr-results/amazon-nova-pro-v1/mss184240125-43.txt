I came to Boston in Nov. To make a short visit before Winter, & I am still here, now waiting for Winter To be gone. I have lived very quietly, only been to the opera a few times. I have seen none of the celebrities, they were too costly. My heart is not broken, cwe not break easily. I thought I should see you here this Spring, because MePeper says so. St- has been a buying Winter, but Spring I aroids are near the cure. Cogie writes me often, I is happy if her bit of house work will do safely. But if she is shut in, she so hates in-door- duties that she feels the harns chafes. She has a gove. - practical man, to keep her from doing unhearies of things. Isn't easy. Love blefs you dear always
