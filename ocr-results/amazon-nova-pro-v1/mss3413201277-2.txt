Loursa Alcott, then at the height of her popularity, wrote in re -
ply to a request for her help.

Concord, Oct. 1, 1873.

"Dear Mrs. Stone:
"I am so busy just now proving "Woman's Right to Labor" that I have
no time to help prove "Woman's Right to Vote." I read your note aloud
to the family, asking, "What shall I say to Mrs. Stone?" A voice from
the transcendental fog which usually 'obscures my honored father inst.
instantly replied, "Tell her you are ready to follow your leader, sure
that you could not have a better one." My brave old mother, with the
ardor of many unquenchable Mays shining in her face, cried out, "Tell
her I am seventy-three, but l mean to go to the polls before I die,
even if my three daughters have to carry me." And two little men, al-
ready mustered in, added the cheering words, "GO ahead, Aunt Neeey,
we will let you vote as much as ever you like."

"Such being the temper of the small Convention of which I am now
president, I cannot hesitate to sat say that, though I may not be with
you in the body, I shall be in spirit, and am, as ever,
Hopefully and heartily yours,

Louisa -may Alcott.
