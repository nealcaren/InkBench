My dear Soufas : 

On my passage thro' 
New York yesterday from Phila. where I 
spoke on Friday morning, I called at Rem- 
hard's offies for news about the salling 
of our steamer. and this is what the clerks 
in the office assured me of: 

The steamer is the "Orange Nassau" 
She will sail from Pierepoint Stores (along 
side of the Wall street ferry) . Probably 
on Friday next, 4th instant at noon, for 
Port an Prince 

I presume that we can count on this 
information as entirely reliable 

Have always understood that the 
Orange Nassau" is the poorest steamer of the 
line. But she is stately and domadic 
fress we can stand it for six days on board of 
999
