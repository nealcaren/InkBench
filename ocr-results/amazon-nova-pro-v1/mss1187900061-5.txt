Washington D.C.
July 15-1883.

Dear Grandfa,

We received your affectionate letter on the 12th and we were very glad to hear from you, and to know that you are getting along nicely.

Everything is passing along smoothly here, excepting the weather. The wind is at times al- most intolerable. It is now about nine o'clock and the thermometer stands about 84 1/2Â°. Charlie has not left you yet for the Eagle Hay & and I doubt whether we will or not, I think the latter as I don't hear him Sunday any 41.
