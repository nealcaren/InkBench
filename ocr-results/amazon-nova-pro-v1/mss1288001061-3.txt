and am glad to feel that they have
brought me more than they have taken
away.  I have lived over and beyond
may brain visions, and am content to
find myself beloved and useful in a
small sphere.


I think you would be sorry for my
mother were you to see her now.  Her body
is sick, but her mental powers are daily
unpaired.  She care of her is overdued
at times, for she is on the border land
between sanity and unbecility, and
cannot yet the left & other handshaw
mine.  She is quite an aged women -
seventy five years old.

And yet, dad as it is, it is in come-way
casier that the relations between us?
used to be.  She has no power any more to
spoil my life, and patience is comparatry
asy, because of the fulfullness of her
precious condition.


This beautiful, back far away, land, separated
from all her friends, and from all the many
interests which have before-fore made her
life.  A more complete contrast & larger
city can hardly be imagined than her
surroudings here.

By youngest brother, an able fellow
of natural geniue, never very robust,
became a physician.  He has a brilliant
professional future before him, whereuring
& mental strain and overwork, had his
health gave way.  He fell a victim to that
dreadful disease locomotive taya'a.
He cannot live in New York.  The last
winter he were in Madison Square had
a very trying one in regard to weather,
and a very hard one to us, as we were
feeling kedly our recent bereavement
in the sudden death of my oldest brother.
Such young life who had endeared
himself to all our hearts he guile a
remarkable manner.
