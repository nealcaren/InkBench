I believe I shall remain in this city
long enough to attend two meetings. I shall
ask Mr. accompanying him to Baltimore
in filling out. I declare, it will have 
the effect to make me silly. I would be with him
at Park, but it will not be in my power.

I am now a book to tell you something which
will make you think me very
most fickle of men. I have decided
to stay in this County till my other
and I feared Mr. would be Mr. Thayer 
Should be the same. Though I would be sorry
for this reason than I care to
justify me in taking. I have indicated 
it being in consequence of the change but
if the Garrison and Mr. Thompson
both think the placed a more
favor the opportunity of controlling
the alarming feeling of this country
and bringing it to the bit of the true
liberty of society in this Co. 
I each think it would be wrong form 
to Miss B. I have therefore written the 
letter.
