Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
Woman's Citizen Committee,
171 Madison Avenue, New York City.

Dear Mrs. Catt:

As a member of the D.A.R., I am protesting against the propaganda which the officers of the Society have adopted from Mrs. Robinson, P.R. Marvin, E.H. Hunter, etc. It occurs to me that it would be useful to be able to quote Mrs. Robinson's anti-suffrage utterances, as showing that in that campaign she was obsessed by the same fears and used the same arguments as she does now against our most useful liberal organizations. Can you send me clippings of her anti-suffrage orations or pamphlets or letters? or can you direct me to where I might find these? I am very desirous of discrediting Mrs. Robinson, who is being taken very seriously by the D.A.R. officers and by many of the rank and file of members.

Can you give me any information about H.M. Haldeman, president of The Better America Federation, and president of the Pittsburgh Pipe and Supply Co., recently indicted for usury? I have been told the above facts, but have no details.

To me it seems a strange phenomenon that the officers of the D.A.R. have committed themselves to this propaganda, and I cannot help wondering if their affiliations are with the great corporations which are fighting change in industrial conditions. I know how the Diamond Match Company fought against giving up the use of phosphorous produced "phossy jaw" in their unfortunate employees. The mill owners are fighting the Child Labor Amendment, and the D.A.R. are opposed to the Child Labor Amendment, passing a resolution throughout the country had no opportunity to disallow this resolution beforehand, as a resolution which I very much deplore. In the Report of the proceedings of the Congress of 1927, the delegates from North Carolina gave $1000. to Mrs. William Sherman Walker for her use as Chairman of National Defense. This "National Defense" propaganda seems to me only a red herring, drawn across the scent of Big Business and the manufacture of war material.

I say all this to give you an idea of what is working in my mind, and what I am seeking to prove, and why I am trying to discredit Mrs. Robinson, and why I wish to connect Mrs. Brossseau and Mrs. Walker, and others of the D.A.R. in business and the manufacture of war material. I am not at all prepared as yet to publish this as my object, and trust that you will hold this letter in confidence, but I would be very glad to have any information that you can give me that might bear out my theory.

Sincerely yours,
( Mrs. )
Helen Tafft Baillie
