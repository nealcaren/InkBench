Dear Madam:

Before you decide to repaper and redecorate your home—why not let us show you how you may save money by cleaning the old surfaces, making them look like new, for a fraction of the cost of new work?

Whether it be PAINT, WALL PAPER, CALCIMINE or TAPESTRY—you’ll be surprised how quickly and satisfactorily all traces of "soft coal smoke," dust and dirt can be removed by our special process.

We will gladly DEMONSTRATE our process without charge, in your own home—and furnish you with an estimate as to the cost of our work for one or more rooms.

In addition to our Interior Cleaning, we do INTERIOR DECORATING, EXTERIOR PAINTING, PAPERHANGING, FURNITURE and FLOOR REFINISHING. Only the best of materials is used—only competent (white) workers are employed—and our prices are quite reasonable. All work guaranteed.

We have renovated many of the most exclusive homes and best office buildings in Washington and Baltimore, such as:

PATTERSON MANSION  
Temporary White House  
15 L BALTIMORE, N.W.  
MR. WOODBURY BLAIR  
1069 H. H. Ave., N.W.  

MAY WE CONVINCE YOU WITH A DEMONSTRATION?  

Yours very truly,  
BALTIMORE RENOVATING COMPANY.

A At the time I called on the COUNTESS of Warwick she had four children, a son who was a war correspondent in the Russian army, a daughter who had recently married Lord Harley, a small son six years old and a baby girl just three months old. She showed me the photos of each of the children, each of whom had inherited good looks from their charming mother.

"Will you be here next Wednesday?" the Countess inquired. "I shall leave early Wednesday morning, as I sail from Liverpool for home Wednesday afternoon," I replied. "I am very sorry," said the Countess; "for we shall have the closing exercises of the Agricultural College Wednesday. There will be special and several interesting exercises which you would enjoy, I am sure. I shall go to the school Tuesday and spend the night there. I wish you could go too. You would enjoy a visit to the Warwick Castle, I know. Everything in the United States is new," continued the Countess, "that I am sure you will be interested in the ancient and Warwick Castle is a magnificent old pile.

You will be in England again some day, will you not?" I expressed the hope that I would. "If you ever come again," said the Countess, "write me a short while before you sail and we shall plan some delightful excursions together; but nobody was more interesting and more wonderful than Samuel Coleridge Taylor, whose father was a full-blooded African and whose mother was English. The afternoon and evening I spent with this talented composer and his charming English wife stand out conspicuously in my mind as among the most delightful experiences of my trip. Samuel Coleridge Taylor was a great musician, to be sure; he knew all about harmony, sharps and flats, but he knew many other things besides. He was the unfortunate gentleman who was a noted physician in one of the largest hospitals in England, when he died.
