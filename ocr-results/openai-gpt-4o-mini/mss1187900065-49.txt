joint notes which I need cash on, and secure its payment by a mortgage on farm stock, implements & cultivated formations. The stock consists of farm & firn animals, two yokes of oxen, two cows, a few Alderney breeds, 3 pigs, a family (mini) farm wagon, etc. - the furniture full & in good condition. Farming implements are required upon such a place. 

The farm is offered at $1,200 and we feel it is priced too low, this spring green, as it is worth considerably more money. 

They (men) would not allow me to track the farm graphic for the elaborate exchanging of the documents. They expect me to mail it to do it at once, help this emergency of their situation. Should this place be offered at Lancaster, it would ruin the sale entirely, as you will see at a glance. 

Can you help them? This, how patient 

quick read? If you can unveil so upon me, I will send this message to paper expected states thence to join any of your other names. 

I feel, Mr. Douglas, that while on clerks upon you is nothing beyond your regard for their mutual pleading, is unnecessary. If you can do it, it will be fully palpable you will be seen in reliving them. 

Please write me as soon as fights in recent trouble. 

Yours from my 
Thos. Sloss
