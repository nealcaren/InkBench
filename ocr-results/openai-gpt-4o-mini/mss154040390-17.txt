with the politics of our own government.  The only communists who
ever made any trouble with Mexico went there from the United
States and were sent back by the Mexican government.

The agrarian revolution in Mexico began in 1910, seven
years before the Russian revolution.  Professor Hackett, of the
University of Texas, an able and distinguished student of Mexican
affairs, has declared: "at the outset it may be said that
the Mexican revolution, which began in 1910, was inevitable
in view of the French revolution, the history of Mexico and as a
celebrated European struggle.  The Mexican revolution
is not a rupture, but the climax of the Mexican revolution
of 1910.  The revolution has caused the most important five years Presidential reign of Porfirio Diaz.  I believe the
facts justify my claim and Professor Hackett has stated it. 

Let us look these facts in the face.  They ought to
silence the lips of those who accuse the American people
of believing that Mexico has simply gone mad over communism.  When
Diaz became President of Mexico in 1876, Mexico already had her
share of land.  The district of Mexico contained 5,500,000 acres of land,
and the surrounding states at least 25,000,000 acres.  Most of
it was sold to the rich.  This acreage thus disposed of was
returned and constitutes the size of all England.  These citizens have received no part of it since; the small holders were
dispossessed in order to gather their resources.

From time immemorial the Mexican villages have owned
their communal lands, their ridges, averaging in area from 
4,390 acres to 17,360 acres.  The villages relied on raising food and pasturing their animals.  
The surrounding lands were rented under Mexican law for a short term, and they were destroyed over
and over again.  Thus these villages were brutalized
themselves, and then the laws of the rich were compounded.  And thus many of the poor people, as Mexican peasants, came to
behold that every year, 3,103,402 Mexicans pined into a state of debt that could never be extinguished.

In 1910, at the close of Diaz' administration, there
were 834 haciendas holding peasants ranging in size from 22,000
to over 60 million acres.  The revenue also from haciendas
does not exist.  Thus the land was inherited.  It is asserted as a
matter of fact that state alone under Diaz' administration needs
of the rural families were without land.
