Following the example of all others I want to give one bit of advice; and I want to leave with you one fact which I have learned as the result of my life's experience. I do not expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may remember the fact. The advice is that when you go forth from the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from indirection; nor is it the idle fancy of a discontented mind, although these changes have both been made.

Each of you young people have --- what is needed to succeed; the opportunities are right at hand for men and women to pursue.

I would not ask you to reform; this is the true giving. Whosoever you are as a lady, whatever you do, I am asking you this: whatever your career may be, don’t let anyone ever think that you are not a true person, honest in your convictions with no ulterior motives.

There is a law of evolution - you have learned much that during your time in college. Remember some regard this law as the earth’s gravitation. Do not think it works while you sleep; but the truth stands, that evolution never evolves without the acclamation of its field.

You have a privilege to live and die for the cause. So I ask you, take this year—this day—along the line where your convictions portray, and to take into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions that you form from it.

The large discussion may unfold into libraries; and so I go. To speak the truth is to learn how to knock off from proposition all the detail which has nothing to do with the proposition. When you have learned that one lesson in life you will travel along the line of your convictions five hundred times as fast.

You, the sons and daughters of Wyoming, have the immortal example of your state to follow. When, fifty-two years ago, the young territory granted the vote to women, it stood alone - alone in all the world. In 1869 I was a young child studying geography, and I remember my map with the bright yellow splotch which included Wyoming, and it was called the American Desert. The granting of votes to women in some unknown state in that great desert had little influence on the outside world. The good thing could come out of a desert! But time brought influence to Wyoming, and then the world jeered at her. I can see them here.

I would not have you forget the early article that was on this issue. To sustain communication assuredly is the surest way for you to know how to stand fast. I do not know in all truth of the single instance that faltered. The world still stood. 

I remember long years ago, for example, when I visited the city of Boston. The papers represented by the Boston Herald, always an opponent of woman’s suffrage, had different opinions on the matter. So—and so from Cheyenne, Wyoming, a woman might be failed—yes, they wrote that in Wyoming although the woman had to vote, they never heard their voice, knowing that they could play a role in the family because the women could carry harmony and so on. It appears that you misspress. 

Boston was very different in those days—there were few to demand
