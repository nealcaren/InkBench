My Brother Dear Sweetheart of Mine -

We all admire you - of course, and love your frolics.  And all it shows that you had that letter June eve.

Mr. F[???], which kept me sure and which the helped - is hoping very hard with - you remember how to breakfast.

I’m certain - it's a useful wonder.

And from my good brother - I think of friends in the times of day who suffered - want to help as do I.

I have having some success with John F. H. - Students of that family.

Well, certainly, it’s a great joy to hear and enjoy me! - please!

I think of doing these during my advisories - 

Yours ever with my good wishes,

Relie Joy Ann.
