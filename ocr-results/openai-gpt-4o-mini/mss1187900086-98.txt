Boston, July 21, 1889.

Dear Frederick Douglass,

When we first had your appointment to Hoyt's, and saw how many kinds and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you, I began to clip and stick them with the intention of sending them all to you - I cut "lots" of them, but also in the huge piles of editorial scraps they have all disappeared but three.

I enclose.

It was pleasant to see the appreciation in which you are held, while you are alive to see it. 

I am not sure that we are glad to hear you Ed - We need you here.
