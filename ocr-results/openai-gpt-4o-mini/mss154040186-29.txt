My dear Mrs. Catt:

I am so glad to have this happy occasion to congratulate the world upon having put in it all these eighty years to inspire and lead humanity to do its best to advance freedom and civilisation. 

You have been a recognized thinker and leader in many fields where men and women are proud to follow. My only regret is that the United States has not yet had the courage to elect a woman to the office of president. You have been my candidate for that place for many years. How proudly we should all have campaigned for you! It is impossible to express adequately our appreciation of all you have done for men and women of the whole world. 

It has been a great privilege and joy to work in the ranks with you so wisely at the head. We all in this household wish you a very Happy Birthday with deep gratitude and congratulation. 

Affectionately,  
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,  
120 Paine Ave.,  
New Rochelle, New York.

My dear Mrs. Johnson,

February 18th, 1928.

A social-delivery letter from Mrs. Stanton just received, requests that I write you the answer to see questions that she has asked so that you will receive this letter before your meeting on Saturday morning.

The Committee on Archives has no place, at present, within to place its collection when it gets it and must raise money which can be used to provide a place for and maintenance. Because it could not arrange for anything in any practical way at this time, it has been decided to place it in the Congressional Library until they have pledged that this collection will be won for twenty-five years. Very few books are in the library, but because by that time, owing to the quality of the paper and ink, there will remain a considerable library which further the sources of information for the suffrage movement. 

The Congressional Library has accepted this library and is ready for it as soon as I can send it to them. They are busy compiling for a large addition to their building and are not sure of space. I have told the Women’s Archives Committee that my collection will go to Washington. 

The Congressional Library is only interested in books, but at the Smithsonian we already have some very interesting subjects linking cases representing the National American Women’s Suffrage Association. 

I have written Alice Stone Blackwell that we have no record of Lucy Stone there and that it is very important that she should be included. The same thing with only numbered in books, and I have some suggestions which I will put in writing. In addition to these are personal collecting the literature for those who are leading it and I have some of the photographs books with illustrations that make sense. 

If the Congressional Library serves, I shall be willing that the books of these pictures go to them. 

Mrs. Will Irwin, who writes a book a year, was paid for writing a history of the women’s work in the suffrage movement. But this does not give me the aspect of much interest. I do not think that they will be able to do this part of the Militant Suffrage history. 

I am not opposed to the Archives have given a small sum of money to it, but I have very little confidence in them. This letter is confidential and cues to the regrets of Mrs. Stanton.

 hastily,  
Carrie C. Catt.
