**PRESIDENTAL INAUGURATION SONG**  
*(Oh Promise Me)*

Oh,  
Promise me that you will never be so  
Treas'hous as that Nixon pedigree, or  
Sell the nation's Whitehouse tenancy as  
Clemency for Nixon's felony.  

Those,  
Big crooks in Washington, D.C. do  
Promise everything from A to Z, like  
Reagan, lie us out of liberty, Oh,  
Promise me. Oh, promise me.
