instead of making marble
and baskets I would try
send you a line. I hope
you will excuse bad writing
and spelling as you will
find. I have seen Miss
Krieger twice since you
left. every thing is going
on just the same so I have
no news to tell
you all are well at
home hoping that
you are. Rosa is well
and sends love to you.

Truly yours
friend
