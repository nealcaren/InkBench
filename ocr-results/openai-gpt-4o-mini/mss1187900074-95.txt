It seems like a while since I wrote to enlarge upon you now. I very much enjoyed your visit among us, and how glad we should be again to welcome you, should you be tempted once more to cross the waste of waters. 

We are all quite well, except among some of our relatives and friends. Sickness and death have been present. A dear cousin of mine, Miss Laura, who remembered your visit to Bellport forty-two years ago, and who was not here to welcome you last.
