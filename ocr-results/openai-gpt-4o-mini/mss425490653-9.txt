Regrettable also that the race has lost such a valuable opportunity claiming to students of excellence it has attempted. But, under the circumstances the rendition of the program was impossible. The members of the singers and the choruses appeared to be so depressed that they said they were too depressed to sing.

Delegates to the International Peace Congress.  
The following letter which was received one morning about the middle of December, 1918 thrilled as with surprise and joy: “Dear Mrs. Terrell,” it read, “It gives me real pleasure to inform you that at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Women’s Peace Party, held in New York City, on the 24th of November, you were elected as one of thirty delegates and alternates to the International Congress which was arranged at the Hague in 1915 should meet at the Peace Conference at the close of the War.” The letter stated that it was likely the meeting would be held either at Paris or the Hague and the time might be either the first week in February or early in May.  
“We realize,” the letter continued, “that this is not an easy journey which we are inviting you to take under existing conditions, in winter, to war-worn countries. But we sincerely hope that your love of human welfare will minimize the difficulties and that you will be able to go with us. Faithfully yours, Alice Peabody Post, Secretary of Telegram from the W.P.P. Mrs. Post was the wife of Dr. Louis Post who was then Secretary of Labor under President Wilson.  
I was working for the War Camp Community Service at the time and was in the South trying to induce more of the communities of the larger cities to send in the establishment of centers for colored women and girls. After I got the summary of the conditions which obstructed in three offices I sent it to headquarters and asked for a leave of absence to go as a delegate to the Peace Congress which would be held in Europe. I received the following letter:  
"My dear Mrs. Terrell: Thank you for your summary; it is a fine piece of work; and the classification workers are delighted with it. It will help us materially in representing the public interests you have visited, & thus to express our appreciation of the devoted work you have done, G.C.S., through the months, and willingly grant you the leave of absence to enable you to make the important trip abroad. Wishing you success in your new undertaking, very sincerely yours, (signed) Geo. A. Black, Director Field Department.”
