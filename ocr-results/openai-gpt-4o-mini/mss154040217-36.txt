Much will depend on the steamer's. We tried to get the sailings but most Companyâ€™s does not yet know about the January steamers.  Mr. Bakker von Bosse of Holland  wants to come.  You met her at the Amsterdam Study Conference.  She is a very good speaker and speaks very good English. 

I spoke to some Belgian women today who might go. The real difficulty will be that they all will just come over for the day of work in Washington, but they 

cannot take extra time to do sight-seeing in New York.  However, some may be able to do that. They surely will want to come and see them at any rate. 

When we go to Stockholm in October we might possibly reach some more women who will want to go. We are also trying to get some younger women, but most of them have jobs - and cannot afford the expense of journey.
