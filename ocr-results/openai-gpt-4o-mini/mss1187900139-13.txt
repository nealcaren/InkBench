Honorable  
James G. Blaine  

Sir, I have the honor to ask the favor of a leave of absence from Port au Prince, beginning on the 20th of June, excluding the time required to reach Washington and the return to again reach Port au Prince, if the letter shall be deemed my duty.  

I am required to state in this request for leave of absence, the number of days I was absent from my post during the preceding year.  I respectfully comply with this instruction on your, by referring you to my dispatch No. 95 dated Dec. 18th 1890, in which it is stated: "I left Port au Prince, on the 19th July and on the 20th of the same month, arrived on my home in the District of Columbia.  On the 3rd I was fully prepared and expected to start on my return to my post of duty by the steamer coming next week on the following day, but by instruction from the Department.
