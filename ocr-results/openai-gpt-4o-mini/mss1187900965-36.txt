3 sentimentalities? On what
could the Kenneth Raguet, & 
the members of the press expound
their eloquence?
If we press Mrs. Miller & her
steam boat, Mr. Douglas & his wife
into the company of a program,
3 prove logically that "Humboldt
States citizens" have a right
to choose their own modes of
employment. With the mending & 
speaking in this country, 
as to civil privileges 
might be ended. I had,
the day when in the disquis-
ition of human rights, exact & equal
justice will be accorded to all
without distinction of race or sex. 
With my kind regards to your
wife, & my best wishes for
your happiness. 
Yours sincerely yours,
Elizabeth, Lady Elgin.
