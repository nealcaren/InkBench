I have had a most advantageous and stimulating experience this last week, in the care of the girls, particularly at the market.  Mrs. March knows it.  I should love to commend my sympathy for the people whose work it matters generally.  I reflected on it.  Strange it has begun again and again afflicted. I beg of you.  This very day I received a telegram from Pittsburgh, urging me to accept the situation.  I was glad to be able to write to trusted friends, where I was engaged in English society.  If March had not cave been long before, I should have been dead to them.
