Dear Douglass,

I think the quotation at the head of your article is a little bit off color. There is an appeal to misery, to men who are inclined to injustice.

I think the following from the same play is better.

"Iâ€™m take my horse when you do take the prefs that both disdain my horse, you take my life,

When you do take the means
wherever I live"

You will pardon the question, Madin?
