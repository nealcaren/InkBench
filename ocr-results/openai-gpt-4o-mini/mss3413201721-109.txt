Of course the mortgage tax on New York mortgages had been paid and the estate was not subject to any tax.

Of course mortgages outside the state of New York would be subject to a very small tax if the executors had taken advantage of Article 15.

Of course the small amount of dividends were not taxable certainly to any amount.

Of course the amount of cash in bank on decedent's death was negligible comparatively and was used by the executors for expenses of the estate.

All of this estate could have been relieved of taxation (except for a small and negligible amount) if the executors and their lawyers had paid the slightest attention to the estate in this regard.

The amount of tax thus wasted amounted to very much more than the Crane claim was allowed to.

Had the executors availed themselves of Article 15 of the Tax Law which had been in existence for four years prior to the death of decedent and of which a lawyer would know and of which any lawyer in the exercise of reasonable care would take advantage of with regard to a client, would have constructed the corpus of the estate from practically any personal taxation for all time to come.

There was no provision in the 1911 Law even compelling the executors within a stated time to avail themselves of the tax except within these provisions.

With this law staring Mr. Todd in the face; with this law providing under Section 536 that unless the tax were paid under it, that the executors would be held for the full amount of taxation which they in fact paid of upwards of 96% and approximately 2Â½%. Mr. Todd in the Fall of 1920 says that he said before the law involved by the Watson case was even passed, that he Todd considered Article 15 of the Tax Law as unconstitutional; and Todd gives his legal reasons why he thought the law of 1911 was unconstitutional.

It has never been held unconstitutional; and it lies on the estate books today in spite of the fact that income tax law has been passed in 1919.

Under Article 15 of the Tax Law the executors could be prevented by the payment of one-half per cent on the face value of all the taxable property of the estate have escaped the taxation for all time to come if they had done what they should have had the sense to do.

Article 15 of the Tax Law was amended by Chapter 465 of the Laws of 1915, which became a law on April 30, 1915; and went into effect immediately.
