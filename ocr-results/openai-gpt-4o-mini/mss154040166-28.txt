**To S.P. Sharman Hotel  
San Francisco**  
New York, November 17th, 1919.

Dear Chair—

The 18 signed checks have arrived O. K. I have my eye on the mortgage falling due “on the old home.” There are dramatic possibilities if we only had a real villain in the background who gives us the alternative between foreclosure and marriage; the while he walks down-stage and kills ’em! I’m proud to be your beggar; I shall of course keep you advised on this matter.

I may forward under date of November 18th a cable for “this macaroni addressed to you—

“Cable from London signed MacMillan quotes Spanish injustices received and sends your call to convention. It is for December 2nd. Also sends ‘sustaining draft’ circular letter asking for funds for convention.”

This I followed by a telegram of my own summarizing the return on the vote as below:

“List of voters you sent me returning from Central Powers stop—**[words crossed out]** I frankly affiliated with you and your group; I strongly object on grounds of literal attendance and personal difficulties to any kind of meeting for more than one or two weeks. I object to a second meeting in Paris for all. On both reports—

I am sending full report from correspondence to San Francisco.

Carrie Chapman Catt

Night Letter

Several of the voting signs include comments as follows:

Schabron says we are promised—

“Nothing in principle—there should be.”

“End of the Convention as of the Board of Management.”

Margaret—“I think this is the best proposal that has been made so far. It might be wise to nip in the bud any suggestion blind to the drawbacks; especially the increase in the voting services, which I feel is terribly hard.” 

Switzerland—“If the majority of the associations affiliated to me will guarantee one thing in Switzerland. Our country is incredibly backward when it comes to women’s energy.” 

“And as with respect to the masculine electors and not parliament, who must recognize rights; they would have so much weight on public opinion as having a Congress.”
