TAMBO ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "Strike two." 
"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered, "Fraud!" 
But the scornful look from Casey, and the audience was awed. 
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain, 
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball by go again. 
The scene is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clinched in hate. 
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate. 
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go, 
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow. 
Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright, 
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light, 
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout; 
But there is no joy in Boston—mighty Casey has struck out.

makes faces and busts.
