My dear Miss Blackwell:

I am sorry to trouble you again about that annuity. The annuity has come through and yet there remains something to do.

I enclose a paper which they ask both you and me to sign. You must have a witness, but not a notary, so any one will do.

I could tell the insurance company to send the checks to me and they would do it, but all insurance companies have a rule that any check must be endorsed by the person receiving the money; therefore, you canâ€™t endorse the check if not otherwise agreed. In any case, there would have to be overseers for your endorsement and getting authority to have all checks sent to me.

The annuity has gone through and I have the policy. I deposited with the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, $1,500 and received Annuity #4496.

The total income from the $3,500 is $146.96 per year. It is my intention to divide this with you as follows: therefore, you receive $73.48 each year for your life. I thought the simplest way to make the payments will be to have one third payable on December 18, 1925 and I will keep that one. The third will come on December 18, 1926 and I will keep that one. Then I will dispose of the remaining $146.96 for each quarterly payment, along with the first one.

If I fit, and I fully expect to, you will get all the interest on the rent and I will go first, I will get it all. That seems fair arrangement.

I shall notify you as the arrangement and they will enter it as they please. You really get for the rest of your life, beginning on December 18, 1925, the interest on your $750.00, and I expect to pay in your whole part this, because the Treasurer will do that.
