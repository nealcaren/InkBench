I was dying to prefer my request that he would purchase Psyche and her children, and so prevent any future separation between her and her husband, as I supposed he would not again attempt to make a present of Joe, at least to one who did not wish to be bothered with his children. In the evening I was alone with Mr. O—— in the strange, bare, wooden-walled room of shanty which is our sitting-room, and revolving in my mind the means of Psyche from her miserable suspense, a long chain of all my possessions in the shape of bracelets, necklaces, brooches, earrings, etc., would in glittering procession through my brain, with many hypothetical calculations of the value of the separate ornaments; and the very doubtful probability of the amount of the whole being equal to the price of this poor woman and her children; and then the great power and privilege I had forgotten of earning money by my own labor occurred to me, and I think, for the first time in my life, my past profession assumed an aspect that truly moved me seriously. For the last four years of my life that preceded my marriage I literally coined money, and never until this moment, I think, did I reflect on the great loss of good to myself and that it is slightly preferable to give up my future for a maintenance by the unpaid labor of others—polling no curiosity, but under the bitter weight of self-reproach, which was then wringing my heart. You will not wonder that, in the midst of such obligations, I suddenly pondered over the true effect: "Mr. O—— is a remarkably deliberate man, and squints, so that, when he has taken a little time to fix his eyes upon me, he is like a book." He laid down a book he was reading, and directed his head and one of his beautiful eyes around and answered, "Dear me, man! I am very sorry—I have sold them." My work fell down on the ground, and my hopes withered, but I could not move. I was so dismayed and surprised; and wide-eyed, I kept exclaiming, "I didn’t know how much I had relied on the value of making an investment for her; for I am laboring under no uncertainty in regard towards myself or her and her children this morning to Mr. —. My dear B——, I have received my unearned reputation; indeed, I had been without the sympathy of the world, and had only witnessed an unfiltered outbreak of indignation about the miserable sufferings that poor creatures, as I trust, secured from any such misery in future. I jumped up and left Mr. O—— still speaking, prayed to thank him for what he had done, and wish that will now bid you good—

by. Think, B——, how it fares with slaves on plantations where there is no crazy Englishwoman to weep, and extend rear, and uphold for them, and no master willing to listen to such appeals.

THE GOLDEN RULE.

"Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets."—Matthew 7:12.

"We consign them (the slaves) to no heathen thrall, but to Christian men, professing the same faith with us, speaking the same language, reading the golden rule, 'do no one-sided and distorted shape,' as it is recorded—rule to slaves, as well as to masters."—Judge Woodward's Speech of December 13th, 1860, page 10, Democratic Edition.

"It is said by some, however, that the great principle of the Gospel, love to God and love to man, necessarily involved the condemnation of Slavery. Yet you should it have any such result, when we remember that this was no new principle, but, on the contrary, was laid down by the Deity to his own chosen people, and was quoted from the Old Testament by the Savior himself? Why should Slavery be thought inconsistent with it? In the relation of master and slave, we are assured by our Southern brethren that there is incomparably more natural love than ever can be found between the employer and the hireling."—Bishop Hopkins' Letter, page 4, Democratic Edition.

Slavery never appeared as hateful, nor slaveholders so vulgar and brutal, as in the following extracts, where a woman tells the world what the kindness of the South has long endured.

**My Dear E——**

Before closing this letter, I have a mind to transcribe to you the entries of a diary recorded in a sort of body-hold; for I found very curious the number of people who visit me, their positions and alignments, and also special particularities concerning them as men of worth recording. You will see how miserable the physical condition of
