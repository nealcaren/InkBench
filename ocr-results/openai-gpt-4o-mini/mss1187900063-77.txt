climbed the heights and crossed
hands with genius and themes
of the good man, with the heart

towed among the stars heaven
his greatness rooted in generosity.

yourself half awake in the

work of the present which visits,
as your home been drawn. It was

the individuality and love in your
dwelling was like a benediction.
