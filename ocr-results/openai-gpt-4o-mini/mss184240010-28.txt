I meant it to call attention to the fact that she has mislaid it in the list for ยง427 in wrong, but it is down on the list.  I sent that, of which she can take note, when it is found, is enough of me to ask.

Annie pays too cold.  Ladies called to see her days; I did not leave their names, but said they would be there again.  I also said that another one, giving the name of Mary Shandon, called the other day to ask if "Miss Anna had anything for them."  I doubt if she has since they asked perhaps, has been here several times before.
