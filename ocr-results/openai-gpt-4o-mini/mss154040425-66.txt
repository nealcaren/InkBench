by the convention. The memories of those who were at the beginning of the Alliance, when no delegate was entitled to vote, when the future looked dark, and progress in our direction moved slowly, are scarcely able to comprehend what thirty years have wrought. Some women complain, because they think they feel the cogs of progress are slipping backward. On the contrary, we, who labored heavily when prospects were dim, see the sun in midheaven shining upon women all the world around with rosy promise.

The delegates from this country who will attend the Istanbul Convention are Josephine Schain, Esther Ogden, Alda H. Wilson, Mary Gray Peck, Mrs. James Picker, Louisa K. Fast, Ruth Woodsmall, Mrs. Frederic Beggs, Mrs. Charles E. Simonson, Lida Stokes Adam, Emma Klahr, and the writer who was president of the Alliance for twenty years.
