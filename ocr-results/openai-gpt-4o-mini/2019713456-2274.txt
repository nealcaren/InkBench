**OLIVER OPTIC'S MAGAZINE.**

1869.  
THIRD YEAR! FIFTH VOLUME!

The immense popularity which the only Juvenile Magazine published has attained, assures the publishers that

**ONCE A WEEK**

**OUR BOYS AND GIRLS,**

commenced as an experiment, was needed by the young people, and is indorsed by their parents and guardians, who demand

A FIRST-CLASS PERIODICAL,  
and are willing to pay a fair price for such, while they insist that it shall not only contain the productions of the

**BEST AMERICAN WRITERS**  
who have distinguished themselves in the department of juvenile literature, but also that it shall be of the

**HIGHEST MORAL TONE.**  
The publishers of OLIVER OPTIC'S MAGAZINE, encouraged by the success of the past, will endeavor, in the coming volume, to meet the requirements of their patrons for such a work more perfectly than ever before.

**TWO HUNDRED JUVENILE BOOKS,**  
written by the most popular authors, they are confident that their unrivalled facilities in this department will enable them to realise their ambition to furnish

**THE CHEAPEST AND THE BEST MAGAZINE**  
for the young people in the United States. Their aim will still be to

**IMPROVE THE MIND AND HEART,**  
and while the work shall amuse and entertain, it shall also impart valuable information in

**ART, SCIENCE AND LITERATURE,**  
and develop and encourage the purest morality. The publication will continue to be under the editorial supervision of OLIVER OPTIC, whose books for young people have now reached the unparalleled demand.

**ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND VOLUMES.**  
These works are in every family all over the land, and are largely relied upon by parents and guardians as moral and educational guides in the training of their children. This popular author, we believe, will be rivals

**AN EXCITING STORY,**  
which shall afford young readers no excuse for resorting to the dangerous trash so abundant at the present time, which shows heroes and heroines with pure and noble characters, worthy the imitation of youth, and depicts ideas in moral colors, so that those who read them will be constantly reminded of the obligations of life, it may be added, to mark the thorough and earnest character of the pages of this enormous work, OLIVER OPTIC'S WRITERS for juvenile will continue the work BOYS AND GIRLS, and all books are issued by the publishers. During the coming year they will continue the

**LAKE SHORE SERIES,**  
four stories of which will appear in this volume, and which, when published in book form, will cost five dollars.

**LIGHTNING EXPRESS; or, The Rival Academies.**  
**ON TIME; or, The Young Captain of the Ucayga Steamer.**  
**SWITCH OFF; or, The War of the Students.**  
**BRAKE UP; or, The Young Pacemakers.**

The issue of these stories in this magazine affords an opportunity to the young people of the United States which can be presented by no other juvenile publication.
