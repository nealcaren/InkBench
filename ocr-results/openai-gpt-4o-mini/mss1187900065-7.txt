And his wretched man with ragged hands  
Did craft each golden word,  
And with my heart I showered them on  
To see my precious Lord.

F. C. W. Harper

Gazing aside,  
The golden burls in which I have  
Is falling to decay.  
But I'd rend my shirt to straight  
Within these walls of clay.  

For me a dimmest cloudy cup  
Amid earth's faint light -  
But heaven afar seems very near  
And nearer to my sight.
