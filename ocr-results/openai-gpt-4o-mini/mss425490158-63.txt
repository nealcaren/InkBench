**FELLOWSHIP CHURCH MUSIC:**

A National Associate member of Fellowship Church recently remarked that it was worth a trip across town to join in the singing of this particular church. I tend to agree based on the singing of the Fellowship Choir. Beginning in the spring of 1946 as a sextet with an occasional soloist, the present choral unit has grown into a choir of thirty voices. Its members form an unusual interracial, cultural group of serious music students, many of whom are now training for concert careers. The choir is fortunate to be under the leadership of Corrine Barrow, an outstanding voice teacher of San Francisco. Some of its members occupy pioneering positions as builders of the most unique choral groups to be found anywhere, in order to demonstrate their belief in the principles to which the Church itself gives testimony.

The Church has offered five distinctive years hours in recent months, continuing the Fellowship Church tradition focused on worship through the arts. They have given courses of poetry and music with Dr. Thurman as reader. Recording were made of this service which are now available to the members and friends over the country. Kay Sandage, Nisei concert pianist, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music in New York City.

The Fellowship Quartet, composed of Caucasian, Chinese and Negro representatives, rendered a peaceful service. It embraces the musical life of Fellowship Church and considers the broad cultural interests of the 6th district. Its personnel, William Von Selden, Kay Sandage, Joseph Van Pelt and Emery Ohllein, have taken part in important functions including the annual dinner of the San Francisco Council for Give Unity, the annual Lutheran Conference banquet, on many occasions for the residents of Fort Miley; for the annual breakfast association held at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, and for Vittorio Colonna, Italian womanâ€™s club.

Under the leadership of a special committee of the Fellowship Guild, with Katherine Luke as chairman, Jean Emmanuel Jr. as co-chairman, the Duo appears at Temple Zion in Berkeley on May 18 for presentation of the Lungsorial Service with beautiful new vestments. The committee appointed by National Associate members especially consider Fellowship Church music internationally directed and American historic, Todd Duncan, contribing vital funds to establish a permanent Fellowship choral unit as a personal expression of his interest and ideals to which they are giving practical expression.
