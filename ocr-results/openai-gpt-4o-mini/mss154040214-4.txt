any more, so if I should go to Marseilles, Alda Wilson must go
with me and I would have to hurry back.

This year I went to Washington, as usual, but I came
down with a cold and was in bed most of the time that we were
there.  I then came home and want to bed again. I stayed there
a week and occupied my room a good deal longer time. My cold
has now gone away and I am feeling fairly well, with the exception
of my feet and sleep. But, dear Rose, I can no longer make speeches.

I hope you will soon be all right again. We shall be
meeting again some of these days. 

Loving Z.

My dear Rose:

I have done a great deal of thinking about Marseilles. 
Mrs. Ashby said that if I ever intended to cross the ocean
again, this was the time to do it.  As a matter of fact, I
had about made up my mind never to cross that ocean again,
yet, after reading her letter, I thought hard how I do
subject.  I finally concluded that there really was no par-
ticular help that I could give.

I am not so familiar with the Alliance now. I do not
know the women who are the workers. My generation, like
Annie Purhuijlen, are saying good-bye to you, who are younger,
are putting our tasks on younger shoulders.

The great question is what to do with the Alliance.
If I could go over with a pocket full of money for you all,
I think you would be glad to see me, but, alas, everybody
is poor here at present.  Everybody says that they can do
but the tasks have gone up enormously, and they do not
know what to do.  I am sure people here have the least of
tasks.  The depression did nothing but add more trouble for Europe.  Now we were getting it "full blast!"  It is amazing that so little effect upon it.  The
general situation has become so little effect upon it.  It
simply grows worse and worse.

At present, I see no prospect in any direction
of receiving money here for the Alliance. The organizations 
are all struggling hard to get money for their own budgets,
which have been much cut down.

Looking back over the history of the Alliance, it 
would seem that Great Britain and the United States has 
furnished the majority of the money the Alliance has
had.  Now these two sources are gone forward, and
no other country known to be likely to come forward and 
take their places.

I have written to Mrs. Ashby and I enclose a copy of 
the letter which pertains much that I have said to you. 
Those ideas may not be good ones, but it is so, it is
because I do not know the situation well.

You must not think of me as a person who can run
