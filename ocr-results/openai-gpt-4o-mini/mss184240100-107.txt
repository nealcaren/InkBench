Boston Dec. 25, '82

My dear Miss Diekinson

Yours given of
the 17th, containing a draft
for five hundred dollars,
came safely to hand,
and I should have
acknowledged its receipt
at once; but it was
against both Lizzie
and myself.  To all I
do even be little, we
are now.  Better much
before to continue as
let all events must have
my

Yours truly,  
Montgomery
