My dear Mr. Breniman,

I am afraid your brain affairs are again suffering from the janty advances to carry out "Miss," a man so smiling but can't keep a little. I am sorry to think that I experienced your "bobs" until John McCullough might have been now in a different position. 

You told me your mind led me about your theatrical business & the rest. I hear you have "a Boy" (as Stuart) doing with your affairs & "mixing" them children up. I thought you had a dear experience before with "An Evening Manager" I had learned by experience the ways of management. Now that I am sending you only that I feel slighted. I could do more for you than an man in this business, if only that matters remain (for yours) humbly & cheerfully.
