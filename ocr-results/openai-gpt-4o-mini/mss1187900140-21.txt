hug Paris. You really ought to come over soon before traveling becomes a dream; and of course you must make our home your home & head quarters for the south of England. We are living in a very pretty country district, with a fine open view of pleasantly hilly & undulating country, not grand in its features but very pleasing. I should like to take you some of our favorite walks - & to introduce you to some of our kind friends. 

My dear Mother is chill living - & after all, I bet.
