carried to be a source
of joy. When we have
had to part it has seemed like
me—As it is—I can only
write you like the different 
high expectations of which my
mind is full.  As a sweet day—I made
up to Philadelphia—but
only for a good time.
I think I must de them
about the next two weeks—I made
the birthday in my mind on
the 23rd of February—My
poor rich brothers will be
very glad to see me
before I go home—There were
two before & have made me
very happy. During the
rest of my months—I seem
to appreciate me—When those
little tricks of both—They 
rich men would make me dance.

You dear little boy, my friend, 
in admiration from their own children.
