My dear Harriet,  

Soon after your previous excellent letter, and before I could see him about the Consulship & St. Thomas, Mr. Blaine, without note or warning, departed from Washington for Bar Harbor, where he now is and it is decided to remain till October; at least so say the papers. He evidently found the climate of Washington at this season, combined with the pressure of the office, too much for him.  

In my last interview with him, I was convinced that his toil and anxiety had made inroads upon his health and constitution, and that the next either take rest or a chill would take him. For this and other reasons, knowing that a personal interview with him would be far better for no one writing than I have not mentioned the St. Thomas proposal to him as yet. The President, too, is so much out of the city, going to and staying so briefly in the city, and giving his time so exclusively to the members of his Cabinet, that I have been unable to see him since Mr. Blaine left.  

It is understood here that no Canadian appointments will now be made in the absence of Secretary Blaine, hence the progress
