Bailey Tenn. Nov. 6th 1891

Hon. Frederick Douglass

We have a secret movement here to move three thousand families out West.  We are trying making every effort to set up the money. In the name of God we call upon you to assist us & get some friends to assist.  This will come directly from the cabins of the poor oppressed downtrodden & most Southern negroes.  If the northern people refuse to help us we can dead men without a shovel.  All we want is to get away from our oppressors & then we can educate our children.  We have sent out several letters to remote friends & we ask you to do the same in behalf of poor suffering humanity.
