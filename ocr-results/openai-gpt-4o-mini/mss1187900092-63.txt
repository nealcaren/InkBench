To the Dr. C. S.
My Dear Sir,

I saw by your return
on my visit, that you would
hear from me with pleasure.  I
had more surprises with it as I
could extract it from father.  He
has much meand and writted with me
in pronouncing it Alie.  You should
decline it throughout this country, it will
do just good.  

Yours truly,  
E. B. Hinds
