That was a grand meeting
All regarded your absence. 

Well on slavery we 
did abolishment for all
"right" to rise up with 
care.  But now the 
very principles apply 
in the case of ruin 
and I have noticed 
that what few as the 
old adult and living 
are mostly prohibiting 
freedom on God alone 
-right is on the riddle
by temperance that 
is ample.  I attended 
the W.C.T.U. in Phil.
their annual meeting 
A grand organization 
it is.  Miss Frances 
E. Willard is certainly
one of the grandest.
