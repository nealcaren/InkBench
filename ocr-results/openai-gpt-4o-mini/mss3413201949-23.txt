(1) The Useless Waste of War
When the great war began, $97 billions of old War Bonds
were sold about the countries of Europe. The total cost in money
of bullets is incredible; in this little world we are most
of $500 billions dollars, with the restoration of villages
and mills into the war.  From here they are
bringing paper money but stopping to satisfy the
cost of the peace of international debts.  So
convoluted and burdensome that a universal peace
followed. What senseless waste! Any wonder they 
can repay their debts to us? 
 
Do you know that 600,000 men killed in the late 
War cost the living $1,500?

history when women produce the farming, war trappings, war minds, and propaganda 
take intelligent about intelligence.
