**Mooney and Billings**

Judge Griffin's Appeal to the Governor

John MacDonald has since sworn to an affidavit that he knew nothing about the crime. The transcript is evidence, upon which Mooney and Billings were convicted, no longer exists.

And because it does not exist, the trial judge (myself), the fore-
