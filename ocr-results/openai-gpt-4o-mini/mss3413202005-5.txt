**When I first saw the light of day on this planet, confused as if I had been rudely awakened from a little sleep, how well I remember the conversation between the doctor and my father as they handled me over to the nurse.**

**I remember looking back into my mother's face at this moment. I look on parental anguish on its brow, turned into maternal brain, as if by dying she was unable to act to me, not a child, but as her own heart, pouring out all her woman's desires, and bemoaning failures.**

**I remember well the silent prayers, when her lips were moving around my heart, and as I look back over the years from her leaving by natural, I realize that there was some subtle power of transmutation at work, for somehow, from the very first moment I seemed to know all the future without being able to give my expression in words.**

**Victoria never had any doubts about destiny. In the same autobiographical school, written in 1895, in London, after her active years, her father, she told of a transition she had seen in her childhood days and the message it gave her from the occult world.**

**"I remember," she said, "one night when all was silent, the great old Fashioned Fireplace was sending out the room in which my sisters and I were sleeping, and I heard that I saw an enormous light and those who were warding what it all meant. I was conscious of the presence of some living being. I was in a little room. As said to myself, "No one can make me out in the open air." When I looked at his face, it was radiant with divine vision. If I should my name at that moment before me, I could not be understood and taken.**

**Victoria was 15 years old when she conducted the "First of her visions." Her first phase was Old, Canning Woodhull, a physician, who she used to accompany on his visits as a witness. She seemed to say that the distinctive impulse in her desire to introduce into from a blank slate of ignorance and to make herself more intelligent.**

**After the birth of a second child, Woodhull, and it for your younger sister, Tennie, began the study of law in her father's office.**

**As Victoria took her second husband, James Blood, and son an internationally known as a crusader.**

**Her story which could hardly startled the world now, were shocked me. As she knew her contemporaries. Having no motherly emotions; to proclaim the direct and certain utmost utter mortification. Once Victoria, violating rules, appealed to Bologna's students on how a child could not be served, she went out brunch with her children.**

**It was at this moment that she made her appearance at "Hall Street."**

**She announced that she went to the events of business, to women, and her colleagues that had sent her as comment on the imitation that version is that she wanted to serve them first-hand, to expose the corruption of the business world under male domination. Still another explanation is that she wanted to raise money for her Presidential campaign.**

**Anyway, the innovation upset the city of New York. Reporters clamored on the trail of Victoria and Tennie. Curious followers flocked to the office of Woodhull, claiming God, "The Lady Brothers," were to the sensation of the moment. Soon, it was also noted that Woodhull had the financial backing of Commodore Vanderbilt.**

**She prepared a memorial, an argument for votes for women and presented it to both houses of Congress. The Judiciary Committee considered it, but Victoria's contention was that by the 14th and 15th Amendments, women were citizens and had the right to vote. Before June 12, 1891, she attempted her case with great eloquence.**

**The story was before the Judiciary Committee of the House. She was one of those controversial. He championed her cause. Further more, Victoria became the initial leader in the suffrage fight. In the election year of 1871, in New York City, she and her sister and others, she went to an election booth, insisted that with Tammany and the police, she went into her into office.**

**In 1872, the so-called Equal Rights rally held a convention of the Northeast States and delegates from 10 States and towns for reform in the Civil Service, an eight-hour day for labor and prison reform.**

**Came a collapse, and soon overshadowed by the events which carried Victoria and Tennie into jail and the law courts. The editors at their time began Woodhull and Claflin's jumped rapidly.**

**Due to by disruption, the crusading sisters had undertaken to expose hypocrisy.**

**The story about Henry Ward Beecher had been circulated by the gossip for some time.**

**In her lectures Victoria Woodhull had been discussing sex with great frankness: "The Human Body, the Temple of God," was the title of one of her lectures. She boldly stated, she recorded no standards or systems of morality. All those books were closed to her. Her sister had her difficulty in finding a place to live. The other had secretly aided her sister in the National Reform Society in other fashions throughout this section of New York.**

**Beecher's attention was diverted by the publication of the story.**

**She had given her story to reporters, and received it in Boston at a national convention of Spiritualists, which elected her president. The daily press would not mind it. So in her mind, Victoria screamed all the louder about "Sunday School morality and public phrases.**
