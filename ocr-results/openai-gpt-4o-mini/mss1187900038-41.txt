**Bridport, Dorsetshire**  
**October 9, 1866**  

My dear Mrs. Douglas,  

Be our return from our three months' tour through France, Italy & Switzerland. We spent a few days at Woodstock, Bright, before starting at Bridport and we formed your third & welcome letter received. It is always a great pleasure to receive one of your nice letters. This one (dated May 3) was a renewal full of interest. I trust you will have as many such adventures as the one you describe as having taken place in Baltimore last winter. It was a mystery that you escaped uninjured, that you might not be so fortunate another time, to be prudent as to where and how you travel, & remember how very available.
