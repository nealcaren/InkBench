Women in the United States have had the vote for twenty years. Three questions are continually asked suffragists. 

First: What benefit has the vote given women? It has made them more self-reliant, intelligent, and confident in their ability to secure what they want and need politically. 

Second: What good has the woman's vote done the country? It has put into the laws of the nation more protective care for family life, for children, for old and dependent persons. It has improved the process of taking the vote and driven from many polling places the corruption and indecency which existed before. 

Third: What should women voters do now? Our nation is imperiled by the sudden uprising of what we had supposed was an outworn system of dictatorships. Democracies mean governments by the people, dictatorships mean governments by one or a few. They oppose each other. They cannot exist at the same time or place. We must choose. Every woman voter will find here a new duty to perform. The meaning of democracy must be re-stated, the rights of men and women clarified, the principles of a republic revivified. There must be a re-baptism in the faith of governments by the people. This is a question so imperious that it overtops and underlies all others. No patriotic citizen should neglect it.
