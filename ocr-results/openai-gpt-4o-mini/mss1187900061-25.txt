Honorable
Frederick Douglass,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglass:

I enclose my speech delivered at the recent commemoration of emancipation here in the District of Columbia and have particularly desired and pleased by your utterance, and surprised at the vigor and brilliancy of your new power after an almost complete performance of them for nearly a half century in the cause of your oppressed people.
