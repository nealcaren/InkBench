Dear Mrs. Terrell:

Nor can I tell you how genuinely delighted I was to receive your beautiful letter. Yes, I knew that Oberlin was going to confer on you a richly merited honorary degree and I was thrilled for still another reason. My sister, Florence, graduated from Oberlin three years ago and unfortunately I have not seen this cherished situation. Then too, my dearest friend, Henry I. Haskell, chief editorial writer and one of the founders of the News Tribune was a member of Oberlin's the late first wife, Isabel, and his second wife, Katherine, sister of Orville Wright. In front of the Art Museum in Oberlin there is a beautiful memorial which Haskell established in memory of Katherine. 

I do hope the Judge's decision in the case of the American Association of University Women will be favorable and I will be so grateful if you will inform me of the outcome. 

My wife joins me in sending fond regards to you. As ever

Cordially yours,  
R. L. Bilheny

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

May we ask you to take a moment or two to read the enclosed leaflet which deals with one of our crucial problems - inequality of educational opportunity for 10% of America’s citizens.

It is not too much to say that upon the 32 colleges represented in the United Negro College Fund rests the major responsibility for supplying wise and capable leadership—ministers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, teachers—for our 14,000,000 Negro citizens.

These are not wealthy colleges; their students come mainly from low-income families. Without these resources, educational opportunities are severely limited; their costs have increased just as ours have. So it is necessary to provide funds to bridge the gap between income and operating expenses. The Fund has helped to meet these needs, and for five years has successfully kept these colleges operating at least at minimum efficiency.

This money is used to provide increased faculty for the largest enrolling school in the schools' history—31,000 students—for salaries, books, laboratory equipment, and other essentials. Without these things the future of the Fund, a gift to the Fund does immediate good for many, in many places. It is not a matter of having a large amount. Any amount will help those who need it and the additional works and a helping hand to those who are already working.

Will you join the more than 6,000 Americans who now make the United Negro College Fund one of their regular philanthropies? 

Sincerely yours,
