I will give another fifty.  
I have a feeling that I did not send my check to the Cambridge League for the National League.  
I am enclosing a check for $50.00, if I have already paid will you destroy this check?  My old check book 
is in Cambridge as I cannot look it up.  

I hope Mrs. has been getting some rain, enough to keep down the forest fires but not been deluged as we have been, 

it has rained almost incessantly since early May, from the first to nineteenth of June we had fifteen days of rain.  Will probably welcome by the middle of July and will phone to learn the amount of the fund.  

Very cordially,  
Zara de Porto
