July 14th, 1944.  

My dear Mrs. Park;

After a three week's stay in the hospital and four weeks at home, with a nurse in charge, Mrs. Catt has today discharged the nurse and is trying to get back to normal living.

She started out this afternoon to dictate some letters, but I could see that she had done enough, so I told her that I would write to a few of the old friends and tell them that she was very much improved in health and that she would love to have a letter from them.

She is now able to see people and although we limit the number per day and the length of visit, usually, she is enjoying seeing her friends once more.

Mrs. Slade and Mrs. Russell are to come out tomorrow afternoon, if Ray Peck comes in very frequently and she is just as much interested as ever in the news of the day and the progress of the winning world. We have set a date for the closing of the European portion of the war game, but still keep our date a dark secret.

CCC sends love and good wishes for your health.

Very sincerely yours,  
**Alicia Wilson**  
for C.C.C.

**Excerpt from letter of Mrs. Catt to Mrs. Maud Wood Park in regard to "TIMES AND NOW". Dec. 6, 1944.**

"When I was eighty, they gave me a birthday party in New York and it was arranged that I was to make the only speech. They suddenly asked for it and it was not finished. When they got it, it was with the intention of having it printed, but I did not know that. I sent them the manuscript and they had just two days to get it printed. I spoke into the room where they were lunching, before I had finished speaking. Then Mrs. Slade made the announcement about it and smiled a bit, but changed it for the printed pamphlet, which had preceded me to give out the correct form. They did not send me the correct or incorrect edition and, only the other day, in going through the shelf that had the remaining copies on it, I sat down and looked it over and found it full of the most terrible mistakes anybody could have put in a pamphlet! I was the safe exchange, for I had given away a lot of them, which was virtually assuring that I thought it was correct. I have actually been blushing ever since. And, if we, ourselves, make errors like that in writing our own history, how can we expect the coming world, not yet born, to ever know the truth about it?"
