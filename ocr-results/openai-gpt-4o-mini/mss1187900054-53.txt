Dear Sir:

I send you by mail today the 
various sheets of an article by the Jay 
which is to be published in the International 
Review on the 29th.  Thinking it 
may interest you I take the liberty of 
enclosing you this copy, but not, if you 
please, to be made public before that 
date. 

Yours Truly, 
Marshall Jewell
