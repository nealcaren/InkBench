Following the example of all elders I want to give one bit of advice, and I want to leave with you one fact which I have learned as the result of my life's experience. I do not expect you to accept the advice, but I hope that you may remember the fact. The advice is that when you go forth from the Wyoming University you shall go with the determination to become men and women of vision.

Vision is not a wild dream which comes in the night from indigestion; nor is it the idle fantasy of a discordant mind, although these charges have both been made.

And if there were young people who went into the world have civilization, you will find you need a special kind of nurse. There is not a single aspect of our development that is not at this moment in need of land and workers, or most moral earnestness. You will find a place to do everything, and I wish not ask you to be reformers — that means giving your whole life to it — and all I am asking you is this: wherever you go, take your conviction with you and the time.

There is a law of evolution — you have learned much of that during your life in college. These are some regard it as absurd, the law of gravitation and that it works while you sleep, but I want to tell you that evolution requires evolvers — men and women of vision who are willing to live and to die for their cause. So I ask you to be an evolver, some of you, along the line where your conviction is strongest. Learn to think things through, to take into consideration all the facts, and especially the opinions of those who do not agree with you, and when you have found your own secret in getting at the truth is to learn how to knock off from —

The first letter I had from him here gave me coherent & sufficient proof that nurse was proving incompetent, — though I can't reconcile it with her apparent efficiency at 1601. However, like thyself, I am most immediately conscious that a proper attendant must be secured before long. Coz. Mary writes me that Lizzie Lee is not to be had, & has not health enough for the place if she were. I shall

You, the sons and daughters of Wyoming, you have the immortal example of your state to follow. When, fifty-two years ago, the young territory granted the votes to women, it stood alone — alone in all the world. In 1869 I was a young child studying geography, and I remember my map with that great yellow splotch which included Wyoming, and it was called the Great American Desert. The granting of votes to women in some unknown state in that great desert had little influence on the outside world. What good thing could come out of a desert? But time brought influence to Wyoming, and then the world jeered at her. I am sure there must have been men who went as delegates to political conventions and as delegates to Congress, who had heard talk to defend the future of the state. To my mind it was a wonderful thing that Wyoming took her stand, — but the less her one iota compared with the fact that she never failed to stand fast. I do not know in all those years of a single instance when she faltered. The world jeered, and still she stood. I remember long years ago, for an example, when appeared in the City of Boston. A man who was interviewed by the Boston Herald, always an opposer of woman's suffrage, the paper quoted him, "The Honorable Mr. So-and-So from Cheyenne, Wyoming, declaring woman suffrage a failure," the article said that in Wyoming, although the women had the vote, they never used it; that in Wyoming, there were such quarrels in the family because the women voted that there was no peace or harmony; and so it went on. It appeared in the morning press. Boston was very ague in those days — there were few who dreamed
