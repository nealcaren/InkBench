pursue, and I trust I shall
have your approval as well as
that of Fred Bassett.

Mr. Blaine has been sick in New
York for two weeks, and he
does not seem to get well. There
is much interest manifested in
his condition.

I thank you for your long and very
kind letter, and regret that I don't

get worked out even when we are
very young men ambitious to run
a long race.

With my kindest regards,
Yours truly,
J. M. Fortune
