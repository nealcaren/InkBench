IN THE LAND O'COTTON
President Warmly Received
in Georgia Today.
VISITED MOTHER'S HOME
ADDRESSES DELIVERED AT ROSWELL AND ATLANTA.
Many Tender Recollections of His Early Childhood Awakened by Visit to the Old Homestead.

BOWELL, Ga., October 20.—President Roosevelt today realized the long-cherished plan of visiting the home of his mother—Rowell, Ga. One of his reasons for coming south was that he could not be sure of seeing her again.

The reception which the President from his train was given at Roswell was one of the most cordial and enthusiastic that has ever been accorded him. The venerable pastor of the church, Rev. Dr. W. R. Baker, who was the pastor of the church when the President was a boy, was present, and Mrs. Roosevelt then shook hands with a number of the old people who were known the President's mother.

On the way to the train the President stopped to pay a visit to Dr. Baker, where he met the pastor's wife, who was a member of the church.

In company with Mrs. Roosevelt he then inspected the old homestead, which is now the property of Mr. J. D. Wing, a lumber merchant of the town. Here he met Mrs. Wood, the postmaster of Roswell.
