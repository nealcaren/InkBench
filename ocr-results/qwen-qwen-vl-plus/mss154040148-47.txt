My dear Mollie:-
I gave you the place for a cable and now it is here. We remain
awaiting day but I suspect that progress is in the direction of frequency and that you
have not cabled at all.
March 27. I was uninterrupted here and now several
things are different and time has passed.
Your cable has been received, and it was such
a relief to get it. Imagine you passing through
that discouraging stage when you think you
never will be well again and when life has
lost all its power. Well, keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. I am so glad
you are better. This world would be a
black and place without you dear Mollie.
I expected to mail you a note here
because I thought it was a good
cable post. It would be a good mail
station, but it seems many American
