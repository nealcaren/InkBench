- In their yellow robes were keeping the sacred spots. In the walled up and overgrown dagobas on top is the hair from the eyebrow of Buddhist. One would suppose these priests would like to excavate these old dagobas, but they not only do not do anything of that kind themselves, but some 5000 petitioned the British government to stop their work, as their shrines were being unhallowed!

Later it talked a good deal, but it spoke Synhalassee, and we could not understand the conversation. From the height we could see the apex of three dagobas and comprehend the great ruin. The whole plain was a jungle of big trees, overspread with luxuriant trailing vines, and choked with underbrush. The old city itself was truly great. There were beautiful palaces, many great temples or dagobas, and it is believed that the whole of that part of the island was in a state of high cultivation, as there are remains of reservoirs, canals, and everywhere indication of extensive irrigation. There was a Brazen Palace wherein a thousand priests resided - a royal palace of 4000 rooms, etc. Here the first sacred "bod" tree was planted. Mahinda's sister brought a branch of the original one under which Buddha
