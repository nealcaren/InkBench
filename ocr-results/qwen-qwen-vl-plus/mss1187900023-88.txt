To Belfast.  Having arrived in this city, long anxious to hold two meetings, I shall not accompany him to Belfast or in any part of Ireland. He will have the field to himself.  I should like to be with him at Cork, but it will not be in my power.  I am now about to tell you something which will make you think one the most fickle of men. I have decided to stay in the country six months longer, and I should not wonder if Mr. Wright should do the sameâ€”though I am sure with far less reason than I have to justify me in staying. I have decided to stay in consequence of the advice both of Mr. Garnier and Mrs. Thompson. Both think the present a most favorable opportunity for promoting the Anti-Slavery feeling of this country and bringing it to the aid of the true Anti-Slavery Society in America. But each think it would be wrong for me to miss the chance therefore the desire to stay.
