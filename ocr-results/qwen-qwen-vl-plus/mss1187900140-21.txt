You really ought to come over soon before travelling becomes a necessity. Of course you must make one house your home & head quarters in the South of England. We are living in a very pretty country district, with an open sea & pleasantly hilly & undulating country, not grand in its features but very pleasing. I should like to take you some of our favorite walks & to introduce you to some of our kind friends. My dear Mother is still living - & often able to go.
