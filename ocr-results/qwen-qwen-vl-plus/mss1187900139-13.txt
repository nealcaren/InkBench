Honorable Mr. James G. Blaine
Sir: I have the honor to ask the favor of a leave of absence from Portland, Maine, beginning on the 20th of June, excluding the time required to reach Washington and the time to again reach Portland, Maine, if the latter should be deemed my duty.

I am required to state in this request for leave of absence, the number of days I was absent from my post during the preceding year. I will respectfully comply with this instruction on this, by referring you to my Dispatch, No. 95 dated Dec. 18th 1890, in which it is stated: "I left Portland, Maine, on the 19th July and on the 26th of the same month, arrived at my home in the District of Columbia. On the 3rd Oct. I was fully prepared and expected to start on my return to my post of duty by the steamer leaving New York on the following day, but, under construction from the Department of State."
