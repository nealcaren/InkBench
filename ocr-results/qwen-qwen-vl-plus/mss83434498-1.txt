Inf'y. Written by Andrew Parks to mother. "We first invested this fort which is the main entrance to MOBILE. We first invested the fort the 27th last month, and have been here ever since. We have not lost many men yet; I killed and 15 wounded; is all of the reg't. There is another fort 6 miles from here, which is also invested, and is guarded by 1500 men with 1500 more troops. The Rebels have a perfect hatred to them, therefore they came out last nite and made three different charges on to our negroes. They repulsed them each time. Our regiment is in the closest of any reg't. We have been under fire of the enemy's guns all day. We are now digging to under mine their works. We are trying to cut off their communication with MOBILE." Much more excellent content, talks about how they are entrenching to avoid the Reb shells, also putting up breastworks. There is a thick fog in the channel which have sunk 2 of their gunboats, the Rebs have also sunk in the ground some torpedoes which have killed quite a number of their men who have walked on them. (the forerather of the land mine) The water is very thick and bold hand, wife cannot concerning BLACK TEARS and the TORPEDO!
