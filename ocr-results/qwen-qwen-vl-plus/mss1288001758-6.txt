That may be in Summer-
Just this moment comes the
little boy with your letter
Thank you Mary dear.
O' sympathy with the song
I will feel at Mr. Brown's decline.
But all
Things work together in good
To so good souls as you.
Mary dear never minds,
There must be something good
In some
In somewhere, because
I deserve it, and I am glad
The children are as good as
mine pie.
I hope they will
Thus so.
Well Mary I don't
To have brine on the butter-
Please look and see if there
is any.
Love to mother & all-
But most to you.
