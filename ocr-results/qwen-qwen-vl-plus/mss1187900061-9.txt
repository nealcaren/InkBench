Instead of making muffins and biscuits, I would try sending you a line. I hope you will excuse Dad's writing and spelling as you will find. I have seen Miss Myers twice since you left. Everything is going on just the same, so I have [no news] to tell you all are well at home, hoping that you are. Rosa is well and sends love to you.

Truly your friend,
Louisa Sprague
