Dear Sir,
I have thought of an expedient to bring in Caroline which I submit to you. It is that Gene Modesty is mustering his force to leave for Mississippi. Now if you could dispense with Jane & see Gene & let her go & slay his negro & get it out that he has bought her - it would I am sure bring her in. Let it be our this it is an arrangement of mine over which you have no control: What do you think of it? Let me know.
Yours truly,
Mr. O'Reile
