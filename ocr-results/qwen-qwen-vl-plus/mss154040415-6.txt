honest desire for peace, for perennial peace, faith
in it, but on th other side of the head there lingers
so much of the spirit of the caveman, with its crafti-
ness, its caution, its jealousy, and especially its tear,
that the caveman side of the head never permits
the peace man's side of the head to do what it knows
it ought to do. And so the nation composed of these
bifurcated-headed citizens fights bravely for peace,
but prepares for war, and that is the way we are
moving on. I am not one of those who believe that
all the army and all the armament should be given
up and that we should trust that everything will
move aright. I only go so far as to believe that in
these preparations for war we are deceiving ourselves
and deceiving our neighbors, when easily, comparatively
easily, we could save the money, save the
anxiety, save our self respect, by establishing world
peace.

There are at the moment four propositions which
have been made for the abolition of war. I do not
think that any one or all together would be sufficient
to achieve this great end, but all of them have
been proposals of Americans. It is a curious thing
that today all the efforts that are being made to
end war originated here and that we are not an
active part of any one of these efforts. As soon as
we give advice to the world we back out and do
not take it ourselves. The first of these propositions
was made by Benjamin Franklin when thirteen
kicking, rebellious, pounding, hating, distrustful,
suspicious colonies managed to surrender to their
common judgment and logic and agreed very timor-
ously to come together in a union and set up a
constitution. When this had been done Benjamin
Franklin said, “Now there will be no wars among
these colonies.” He made a little mistake. There
will be no more war among these colonies and if
Europe would now set up a United States of Europe
letting down all the customs and all the frontiers
between the countries, war might be avoided there.

No, curiously enough, that idea took root and by
and by organizations sprang up, but I think not
until the last generation. I have myself known
many members of the organizations working toward
a United States of Europe in the different countries

there. They were members of parliament. But this
perennial fear of one's neighbors always rose uppermost
and all the countries maintained their
tremendous military preparedness and the minority
could never make them believe in this marvelous
change. But even yet it is suggested that for Europe
eventually it may come into existence. There is
nothing for us to do. It is a proposition for the
Europeans, but it is interesting to note that this
idea is still working in Europe and that it was
American.

The next idea in point of time was the world court.
When the Czar of Russia called a meeting at the
Hague to consider the abolition of war there
resulted from it the Hague Tribunal. It was proposed
by the United States delegation. It is called
the American plan, but great jurists were not pleased
with this court. It is good as far as it goes. It
will exist. It is an arbitration court. It has settled
a number of troublesome questions, but great jurists
like Mr. Root did not think the court was permanent
enough. It was too ephemeral and too
temporary in its character, so he for one continually
talked for an international court of justice that
should be a real court, a permanent, continuing
court, and so the United States made a proposal
that there should be another Hague tribunal in
order that they might make this proposal. It took
place in 1901, and the United States delegation made
this proposal and all the delegates who were there
—there were 46 nations represented—voted unanimously
for this court, but it was never realized for
the reason that they could not agree as to how
the judges should be elected, and so it was laid
away on the shelf until the conference in Paris,
the Peace Conference. Then it was written into
the covenant of the League of Nations that such a
court should be set up as a part of the machinery
for abolishing war. They did it in this way: An
international commission of great and distinguished
jurists were selected to write the constitution
or the protocol, as they called it. Among them was
Elihu Root. It has always been his chief hobby
and it is said that he wrote most of that protocol.
But at any rate the interesting thing is that Mr. Root
