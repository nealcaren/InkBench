Friday Mar 8

My dear friend,
Papers from Athens
I sent to Mr. -- because I
understood you were to
be there at just that time
but I could not have
met you. I was sick
for Mrs. Mrs. L. I was very
much disappointed too
but so glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
I do take all care of my
self for that future to
see hopes. But this weather kills
me if it was one long summer
