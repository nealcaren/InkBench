Bridport, Dorsetshire
October 9, 1866

My dear Mr. Douglass,

On our return from our three-months' tour through France, Italy, & Lowicz Land, we spent a few days at Woodcote, Bristol, before reaching Bridport. And there we found your kind & welcome letters. It is always a great pleasure to receive one of your nice long letters, & this one [dated May] was as usual full of interest. I trust you will have us more such adventures as the one you describe as having taken place in Baltimore last winter. It was a mercy that you escaped uninjured, but you might not be so fortunate another time, so be prudent as to where & how you travel, and remember how very valuable
