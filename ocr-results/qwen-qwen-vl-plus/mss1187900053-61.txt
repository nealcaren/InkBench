Dear Mr Douglas,

It is a very long time since we have written to you or heard from you, and I write now in hopes of provoking a reply. We really are very much in the dark about you, and do not even know whether you still hold office under the Government, as we have not heard to the contrary. I conclude that you do - and therefore that you have not been lecturing and holding meetings over the country this last whilst as of old. I hope that your health is good - and that you can report well of yourself and your family.
