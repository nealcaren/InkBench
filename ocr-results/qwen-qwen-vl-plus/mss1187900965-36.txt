3 sentimentalisms? On what
crutch the Kenneth Rayners, &
the members of the Piers expound
their eloquence?

If we press Mrs Miller & her
steamboat! Mr Douglas & his wife
into the compass of a syllabium,
& prove logically that "United
States citizens" have a right
to choose their own wives &
employments. Half the writing
speaking in this North
country, as to class privileges
might be ended. Until
the day when in the discipline
of human rights, exact & equal
justice will be demanded to all
without distinction of race or sex,
With my kind regards to your
wife, & my best wishes for
your happiness.
Very sincerely yours
Elizabeth Lady Hartloe,
