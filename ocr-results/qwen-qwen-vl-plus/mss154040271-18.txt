May 24 1920

Dear Mary,
I received a book yesterdayâ€”the 24th gift this spring! If this book tells how to attain success with a boat when the author (would she) has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary to express it, though she has, it will be most welcome. Until I have read it, I shall not know whether to return it or to keep it with Thaxter without thanks. I am sending you a tiny box of leftover seeds. This is no gift, just hold them till I haven't the remotest idea what any of them are, but I will find out. If you are nearer I should know given you at garden fuel of plants from the greenhouse or at least which will either die in my garden or give withered little blossoms. They might be your stalwart wonders in yours. When you come down, I shall take you to see a garden that is worth looking at.
