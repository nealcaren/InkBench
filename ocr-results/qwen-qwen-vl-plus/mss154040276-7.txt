My dear Mary:
I feel perfectly ashamed for not having written to you all these weeks since I am staying with our dearly beloved Chief. However, there seemed to be so much to do each day and I did not want to send you a hurried note but a real letter full of details which no one else could give you. Mrs. Catt reads me parts of your letters and we are both much interested in your lovely trip and we are so glad you are having such a grand time. You certainly can give the liveliest descriptions of things and we much enjoy the amusing spirit and wit. Well to begin with the beginning. Before I came I was certainly very worried about Mother Catt and I just could not wait the day to land. Then I came on a Saturday afternoon Dec. 8th and the dear lady was waiting for me on the platform in New Rochelle. We can imagine that the first two days there was very much to talk about and to tell. The dear lady just poured it all out to me and it seemed to relieve her greatly although there were many tears, still felt she liked to tell
