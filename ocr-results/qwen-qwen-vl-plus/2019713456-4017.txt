**The Career of the God-Idea in History**

BY HUDSON TUTTLE,
AUTHOR OF "ARCANA OF NATURE," "ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN," ETC.

Dwelling in the light that no man can approach unto. . . Canst thou by searching find out God? . . . Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out. —BIBLE.

Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
—SHAKESPEARE.
