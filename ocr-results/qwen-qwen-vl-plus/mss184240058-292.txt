When the sun brings it to the active state, it nearly ends me.
To a month, it's shining, varied
to good for a tempest at the end.
Michigan cools
delightfully fresh, & clear, * green, & rolling.
I begin to feel better at once.
Of vice units up
due to unhealthful manners
often here * - partly look to
all the curse, * & kind
the way habits.
And two more than glad to
get my manner's sealed, written
when born. Next little class, as aurora.
