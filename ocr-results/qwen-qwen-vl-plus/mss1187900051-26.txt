Friend Douglass,

I started from Rochester yesterday morning to string a wire to Hemlock Lake. Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the swamp holes a few [deleted] north of the Rush Reservoir. I attached a pocket instrument upon the wire and communicated with the person who took my place during my absence. He telegraphed me the substances of your postal card. Before I left home I read your telegram, + went to the Rock. Sav. Bk where the draft was procured and notified them of its non-reception, and of your wish for a duplicate. They said that they could not give another until they had received their ape from the Clearing house at NY, which would be the first week
