I came to Boston in Nov. to make a short visit before winter, & I am still here, now waiting for winter to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only been to the opera a few times. I have seen none of the celebrities, they were too costly. My heart is not broken, it was not broken easily. I thought I should see you here this spring, because Mr. Peppers said so. It has been a trying winter, but spring & violets are near the corner. Agie writes me often, it is happy if her bit of house-work will do itself. But if she is shut in, she su mates in-door duties. That she frets, she frets. She has a gover-practical man, to keep her from doing unhearn of things. Taint easy. You bless you dear--always.

Sincerely,
Mama Lea.
