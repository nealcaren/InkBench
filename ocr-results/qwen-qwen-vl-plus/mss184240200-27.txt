I know a poet speaks when
he says it!!! I went take
his opinion when I'm about,
surely I prefer mine when
I have the same chance to judge
as he.

I don't know why you
wanted to see that scrap
of a letter from my western
friend but I enclose a
copy.

Goodbye again
with heartfelt
wishes for your health
specially if you think of
facing the vigor of a
New England summer next
July.
