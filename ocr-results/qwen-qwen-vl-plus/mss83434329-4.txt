cure rather than a blessing. I would not, at once, entirely emancipate him from the control of his master—but it should not be as now, an arbitrary, unqualified control. For this reason, I am opposed to the principle of universal suffrage, which should be universal. In saying this, sir, I do but express a principle which has long been dear to me as an Anti-slavery man. I shall continue to maintain, as a cardinal principle in my political creed, the necessity of the immediate abolition of the slave trade upon the high seas—a pirate, and dooms him to the flames. Shall the slave trade be carried on with impunity? Shall our citizens be outlawed, while here, the same offenders against public morality are allowed to go free? Shall the slave trade be unmolested? Sir, this subject demands a searching investigation. Will gentlemen deny such investigation? Shall we be content to bury the matter in silence, or "buried in the tomb of all the Capetites"? I trust they will not. I am fully persuaded that the abolition of the slave trade will not only be a great moral benefit and adapted to his new condition—laws will be made to protect him in all the rights which he now enjoys over him—laws which should protect him in all the rights which he now enjoys over him—laws which should protect him in all the rights which he now enjoys over him—laws which should protect him
