If you will but keep
the eye of your own
spirit turned within.
For it is from within
(not without) that
the precious jewel of
truth & light is to
be sought - & found.
And darling Jane
will find it, & keep
it, and live it - and
all men & women still
call you blessed.
Lastly but oh so dear,
Susan D. Smith
