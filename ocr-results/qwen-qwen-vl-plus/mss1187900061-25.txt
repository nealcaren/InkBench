Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
July 25, 1883.

Honorable
W.H. Douglas,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglas:

I read your speech delivered on this occasion commemorative of Emancipation in the District of Columbia and was particularly edified and pleased by your utterances, and surprised at the vigor and brilliancy of your powers after an almost constant defense of them for nearly a half century in the cause of suppressed people.
