I have had a most advantageous situation offered me in Russia, in one of the Forty Families of the Janet - but I had accepted it. I shall have considerable need of sympathy for the Pole which work a Math has betrayed - I refused it. Though it was again and again pressed upon me - this very day I received a telegram from Petersburg - begging me to accept the situation. I was glad to be able to write to Countess Baloff that I was engaged to an English family - though not have been long before I should have been dealt with.
