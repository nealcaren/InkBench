Washington D.C.
Mar 6 1857

Dear Father,

Yours of the 1st inst. is just received. I saw an account of one of your lecture in New Jersey published in the N.Y. Tribune, and thought that you might have other appointments, and hearing from you. I am well except the baby, he has a severe cold. Dr. Augusta is attending him, we are afraid he will have the croup; but hope not. I don't wish to trouble your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and myself. I know your mind, and time is better occupied. You may know the cause of the difficulty; but I know you don't know the whole truth, and it is hard to find it out under the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone against us. Look for another war. If you will be at home any length of time I will write again soon, as I am very busy just now. Tibbi would send love if she knew I was writing. Love to Mother and all.

Your aff. son
Cha. R. Douglas
