**FUNDAMENTALLY BUSINESS IS GOOD**

**RUTH MCCORMICK, DENEEN SOUND CAMPAIGN CRIES**
Senator Attacks County Administration.

BY PAUL BROWN
Ruth Uniter Senator Deneen and Representative Ruth Hanna McCormick, who has unseated her rival in the election, yesterday what was construed as a closed meeting, although each has chosen the first day of the new year for a re-election campaign. Mrs. McCormick just before leaving addressed more than 100 of his followers—Chicago ward committeemen, delegates, and other committeemen, and officeholders—at a closed meeting, but later the speeches were broadcast over the radio. A criticism of the condition of the county administration was made, and a statement charging that the county board has been neglecting public affairs that she is not able to carry out her duties was made. Mrs. McCormick said that she is not only determined to remain in the Senate but also to be re-elected.

**Building the Builders of Chicago**

J. Cornelius Wilkins ($25,000 a year), Barbara Hughes ($100 a month), and Jimmy Jones ($11 a week) rally to the aid of P.E. Smith. The baked beans go big with Cornelius—Barbara says the hamburger bun is divine—Jimmy goes hard for the soup and a big cut of that spicy sausage. You are building a better Chicagoans—we are building better Chicagoans.

**Senator Condemns Prejudice.**

In the past was Diverse by mere reputation. "Have I overstated conditions in our community? Political conditions have been influenced by small favors to some individuals and permitted unworthy motives to influence their actions. This will be revealed in some measure by the coming primaries. The people have been deceived, and the people have moved closely but mightily against the corrupt and unscrupulous share of the public office."

**The bankruptcy in the character of the individual who appeals to the people for votes and those citizens who permit their votes to be used for the election of unworthy men is no remedy. The community will soon pay the penalty of what we have done. The people are to pay for it in high taxes, enormous interest on borrowed funds, and the corruption of the city government. The city, in the public health, the poor and the youth of the city must die—senatorial education."
