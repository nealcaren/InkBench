Chicago, Ill., U.S.A., June 1st.

My dear Mr. Dunlap:
I am on my way to the East coast tomorrow morning, and have put off so long as calling upon you and Mr. Douglas that I shall have to do so. Do make my excuses to Mrs. Dunlap for me. I remember her with so much pleasure in Paris. I hope to return to Chicago later in the summer, and then I will not fail to see you both. And the meanwhile, believe me,

Very cordially yours,

Theodore Stanton,
26 West 61st St.,
New York.
