Hon. Rev. Basinglass.
Sir:

I have the honor to forward to you the published action of the Ebenezer Lyceum, as directed, and ask your acceptance of the same as token of reverence and respect for our great acknowledged leader.

For the Good of the Whole People.
The Ebenezer Lyceum had an interesting meeting yesterday afternoon, Rev. E. S. Atkinson, president, and A. E. Ryder, secretary. After the reading of an essay, singing of a duet, and listening to an address, the following was adopted:

Whereas it is a duty we owe to every citizen to express our grateful thanks for any and every intelligent and virtuous act of public interest and benefit done for the good of the community; and

Whereas the Hon. Frederick Douglass has, during a long life of public service, been conspicuous for the good and wholesome advice and words of wisdom spoken with honest courage for the good of the whole people and his country; now therefore

Resolved, That in the recent address delivered by Mr. Douglass before a large audience under the auspices of the Bethel Literary Association, we recognize in him our beloved and honored leader, and tender our thanks for the words he has spoken, the statement he has made, and we pledge him our loyal devotion and support.

Resolved, That the President be, and he is hereby authorized to tender the congratulations of this association to Mr. Douglass and present him with a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions.

Respectfully,
E. S. Atkinson
