My dear Sir,
I am on my way to see your speech, though I
heard you with pleasure deliver it. I had some
misgivings with it as I read it last night. I read it
too fast, he was much clearer & much with me in
pronouncing it able, Jim deemed declining it throughout
the country, it will do not good.
Yours truly,
E.B. Smith
