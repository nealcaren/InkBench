that after a battle of two hours they (the
"Northern forces") were repulsed, leaving
"many dead and wounded," and that order
"and tranquility reigned in the South.
"We shall have on the 19th a mail of the
"10th from Port-au-Prince via Navassa, a cable on
"20th via Cuba and a mail again on the 25th
"one.
I continue to believe that the
"Northern forces will raise the siege and
"retreat to the North, proclaiming perhaps
"secession, and that the unfortunate state
"of things will continue yet for months.
"If the governments of Cleveland and Harris
"son had acted in good faith in their relations with Hayti, this war would not have
"lasted. -- I ask myself if it would not
"be well for me to go to Port-au-Prince with
"Mr. Douglass to see if the two parties content
"ing could arrive at an honorable understanding."
Now, my dear Douglass, this letter is already so
long that I must cut it short right here.
Very sincerely and very cordially yours,
Mrs. Bassett and [???]
