with enthusiasm. They have been much
appreciatedâ€”more than you can know.
I am longing to hear who is going to
Rome, how and when. I am as ignorant
as a mild turkey and I am longing
to see the mail I need reached
Panama after I have gone. You have
been the best correspondent for your
letters are always clear when I arrive.
I learn that marks not carried by
this boat to N.Y but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you will
get this soon. It is not far to Panama.
Please accept my collective letters
as one for you. I must go address now.
Don't forget to write. She will delay
my going. Lovingly indeed!
