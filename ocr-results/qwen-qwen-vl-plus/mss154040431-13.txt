**ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN PRUSSIA NOW 10%**

**"Evidence of Moral Healthiness of German Race," Berlin Councillor Declares.**

**January 12, 1917**

**BERLIN, Dec. 12. (Associated Press)â€”Ten per cent of the children born in Prussia are illegitimate, according to statistics made public by the Reichstag representatives in the debate on the vital statistics of the empire.**

Dr. Brugs, in one of the most notable speeches of the debate, pointed out that the large number of illegitimate births is the result of the experience of the moral healthiness of the German race. He referred to the course of an appeal made by a Prussian nobleman to the Reichstag to prevent the marriage between legitimate and illegitimate children.

The paradoxical though it may seem, the large number of illegitimate births represents a means of preventing the overpopulation of the country. They afford protection to the reproduction of families, an idea which has been the foundation of the redemption of families, an idea which has been the foundation of the redemption of families, an
