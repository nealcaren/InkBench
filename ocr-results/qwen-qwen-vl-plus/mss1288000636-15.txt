**New Haven Register**

**Nemps back on the farms were talking in favor of federal milk control in secondary markets. While one finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the New Haven ex-mayor that it is more a part of a national conspiracy for Gov. Roosevelt administration than it would have been for him to praise it, the poet, English in which the governor's pronouncing two years ago seemed to lend significance to his failure to mention it now. In 1933, the governor, formerly dean of the Yale graduate school of English literature, found his soul stirred, when speaking for New Haven's present mayor, to this glowing passage— "When the sun has appeared, the eternal symbol of hope and life, we are filled with a new faith and course in a new deal. The dawn of better and happier days under the sending, hopeful tints the east with gray."

The fact that the shrewd old gentleman who occupied the governor's chair in Hartford, was saying nothing just now about "the horizon" and "the hills" and the "new deal" may, perhaps, be due to the entire ground being supplied by New Haven's Republican ex-mayor. It may be, as some shrewdly suggest, that the Democratic mayor of New Haven, having taken the lead in the campaign on that as the chief issue. It may also be that the Democrats, who generally suffered in the Connecticut election, have been too long, have found that the new deal isn't altogether their best talking point, in Connecticut. And it may be that "Uncle Toby," as said Gov. Cross, having been quoted during the summer as making occasional remarks which indicated about the economic situation which has been shown by ex-Gov. Ely, doesn't see the new deal quite as he did in 1933 and just doesn't want to talk about it any more. Perhaps the reason can be explained in all three ways.

Tuning In on Moscow
Seven Germans were sentenced to prison the other day for listening to a radio broadcast of the Soviet government. Their sentences lengthened to four years for the additional offense of discussing politics while the broadcasts was going on.

To most people who have ever happened to "pick up Moscow" this will seem a high price to pay for either the privilege of the entertainment offered. But the same would be true of broadcasts from Berlin or Rome whenever these secret Mozart and Verdi for the avid wants of the professional listener.

Whether Russians are being sent to jail for tuning in on the fisher, or the duc, has not been reported, but it is hard to believe that the emigrants are put in danger by the dreary stuff that is being broadcast in prodigious quantities for consumption abroad. It would save all the diplomatic tangles if the Soviets would simply apply to let the broadcasts cancel out, assuming, for example, that Russian broadcasts do no more damage than the German broadcasts do in Russia.

To admit, by police action, that this is not the case seems like a tacit admission of inefficiency in this kind of work. If Dr. Ely has not yet managed to bring the radio armament of Germany up to the Russian level of efficiency it is time for a shakeup in the ministry of propaganda.

American and French Bombing Planes
The description of 24 French bombing planes now being hurried to completion near Paris and claimed to be the biggest of any type ever built by any company, seen with the United States army's Boeing bomber recently destroyed at Dayton, O. With a wing spread of 108 feet the French planes seem surprisingly small, with a small margin, the claim as to size. But the 232-miles-an-hour average which the Boeing plane maintained for the distance from Dayton to Dayton makes the French planes seem lagardas, 12 being designed for a maximum of 180 miles and 12 for a maximum of 208 miles.

The superiority of the American plane is still greater in view of the accepted understanding that its Seattle-Dayton flight, was made at less than three-fourths its full power and that its maximum with four 800 horse-power motors, intended eventually to be re-

**IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION**

To the Editor of The Republican—
The mining law is a big base? But a mining law is based on gold dug from the ground, not on wealth dug from the pockets of harassed taxpayers back.

earthquake. Ordinarily their chats are limited to comparing notes on the weather in different parts of the country, and an excited outburst at mid-day when the slowest world has not yet been told keeps the air full of chatter for hours.

It is suggested in a dispatch from Washington that "suation of busi

The Master's Touch Horatius Bonar
In the still air the music flies unheard
In the rough marble beauty hides unseen:
To wake the music and the beauty
The master's touch, the sculptor's skillful hand;
Not let the music is in us die!
Let the sculptor, bow and polish us; not

Hidden and lost, thy form within us
Spare not the stroke! Do with us as a

Let there be wrought unfinished, broken
