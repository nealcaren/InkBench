Mrs. Hooker is pacific, though I might feel that she ought
not to be so. She wrote to me last week about "Sally" & how
stomach is oft to turn into a vinegar factory (as he expresses
it) during the night. During the last week we have been
making soap, & thereby hangs a tale. I came home from the
city one afternoon, & was greeted by Maggie with the pleasing
intelligence that Mr. Kelian's Johnny had pulled up the
plug of one of the stationary washtubs in which the new-made
soap had been put to harden, & the soap had gone down into
the pipe & hardened there, stopping the escape of the waste water,
promising us a abundant
troubles & a long plumbers' bill
before things could be set right.
Mr. K's eldest boy is a quiet
well-behaved lad who never
meddles with things, while
Johnny has his fingers in
everything. But, Johnny is
considered the smarter, & he
is petted & Tommy rather put
down. This time, however, his
horrified father gave him
a sound thrashing - [unfortunate]
rather to the harm done than
to the harm meant, which
was none; for he had no
idea of the trouble he was
going to make. Well, I told
Maggie not to say anything
to Mamma till after supper,
because our fortunes always
seem so much worse when
you hear of them on an empty
Stomach. So when Mamma
came home from Boston
laden with bundles & what not,
the had but took very full & satisfactory answers. [They] put [their]
