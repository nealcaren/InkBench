On Thursday morning we sallied forth at an early hour after photographs, and I bought two dozen. We then went to Lady Mackenzie's for morning tea. We found her with her hat on, as that fool motion has reached S.A. Later we visited the Museum. Miss Cameron lunched with Lady Steel, who has married and come to S.A., but I dared not do so much and rested at the hotel. At four there was a tea out of town about a mile. The lady, Mrs. Davis, the wife of a publisher, sent her carriage for me and sent me home. She had a beautiful big home and the drawing room was of elegant size with a platform at one end. I never saw a room anywhere which I envied more. In the evening we had our public meeting.

We left [Marg]esburg the next morning, arriving in Durban about one o'clock. The usual committee met us. Never did they fail to do this and to see us off. We went at once to our hotel where for 15 shillings inclusive we had most delightful rooms facing the sea. This was Friday, October 13th. After lunch and a little cleaning up, we went to a meeting of the Club (suffrage). When that was over the president, Mrs. Ayres took me to a shop where she recommended a dressmaker. She was willing to do the work, but the material must be purchased in the shop, so I arranged to have two simple frocks of muslin made. I had to do some skirmishing about to collect all my baggage. I had forwarded all my trunks except the wardrobe from Cape Town, and on chairs came on too. I had sent a case of books by the boat I came on and another case of books from Pt. Elizabeth. A hat box came on from Pretoria. My thinnest summer things were in these trunks. The evening was spent in unpacking such as I had received. On Saturday I went to see another dressmaker in order to get the material made which I had bought in Johannesburg. I

succeeded and left the muslin for two more dresses. We met the ladies of the suffrage club for morning tea at a restaurant and it was a curious sight to see crowds of men and women gathered at this hour for their precious cup. Then we went shopping, getting back to the hotel at 1 for lunch. I unpacked further in the afternoon and Mrs. Ayers and Mrs. Behr took tea with me at four and I was occupied with callers until dinner. It was good to get to bed early. On Sunday I worked more with my things and went with Miss Cameron to Mrs. Kerr Cross's for tea at four. She received us out of doors. We found Dr. Jacobs, Mrs. Boerama and some delegates had arrived at the hotel. Again I went to bed early, but first I trimmed a new hat I had bought.

On Monday the Convention began and I was present every minute to advise when necessary. We met from eleven to one and from 2:30 to 5. In the evening was the reception, where I spoke and again got even with those who bored me. On Tuesday we met in the morning and in the afternoon we went out in two naphtha launches to Salisbury Island where among the trees and mosquitoes we had tea with which was served some delicious home made cake. It was a pleasant afternoon. That evening there was a public meeting in a small hall where the delegates were to speak. Some had been tired out and had headaches as the result of the heavy work, so I had to make a speech to help out. The next day we met in the morning as usual and in the afternoon there was a trolley ride and a tea at a fine home. I excused myself from that and went to bed. The public meeting came that evening.

Durban has a town hall which covers a block, and it contains a beautiful big hall with most disconcerting acoustic properties. For the first time I could not wear my velvet. The sweat poured off in buckets as it was.
