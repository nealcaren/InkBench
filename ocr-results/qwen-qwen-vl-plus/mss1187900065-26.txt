Dear Sir

I yesterday deposited with the Surrogate of Hudson
Co., New Jersey, the Will of the late Ottilia Assing, along
with a letter from me declining to serve as Executor,
copies of which I forward to you with this.

You will please take such action on
the matter of supplying a substitute, as you deem proper,
and believe me

Yours with great respect

Henry Bergh
