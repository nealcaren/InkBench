Dear Mrs Chapmann Call,

It took in our programme of the year to read lectures on "Famous Women." Mr. Louis Janiculescu and I will do it, he in the L.D. D.F. and in popular evening course. But as there are no complete libraries in Romania and not a single feminist library, it is impossible for us even to know the titles of the books necessary for popularization. Therefore, we ask you to ask the other sections of I.W.S.A. to help.

Feeling so much the lips of a pen library we will try at one time without studies, to found one at B. and perhaps that will be able to assemble round it the women in a club as we are dreaming of since a long time. Would you association be able for the generous act of some help into sisters and to send us one of the standard work on women movement in your country and specially books, where we could find biographies of you famous women? We would speak in a first lecture on political and social prominent women and in a second those the portraits of young maid and science. But we know so little, it is to say not much.
