My Dear Mrs. Dickinson:
Your valued note of the 6th inst was duly received.
I have expressed my thanks to Mr. Brown for the Indianapolis reference & to Mr. Brogan for the more fluent notice of your address in our Logansport Journal.
Mother, they brothers, are well and join me in expressing our high regard & consideration for you and yours.
I was yesterday at Indianapolis where we had a monastic devotion. We hope some of your friends will have forgotten Indiana after No. 6.
I have noted the influence & impression you have made where you have been since coming here
and feel confident that your efforts will meet with the utmost favorage in Indiana as well as Michigan & New York.
Very Respectfully
W.T. Wilson
