ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

Alice Stone Blackwell, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to obtain a medical degree and another aunt was the first to be ordained a minister. Her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college and became a leader against Negro slavery. As a woman suffragist, she was a powerful and fearless fighter for women's rights. Her life was considered an indecency; and throughout her life was one of the half-dozen great national figures in the woman's movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to the woman's cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from babyhood in the widely varied activities of her parents, which Miss Blackwell has recorded in her book "Lucy Stone, Pioneer of Woman's Rights". Miss Blackwell was assistant or editor-in-chief of the Woman's Journal for thirty-two years and was the National American Woman Suffrage Association for twenty-two years and President of the New England and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Associations. As Miss Blackwell's chief weapon was the pen, often anonymous, she was not personally in the public eye as much as her mother. But she was a brilliant editor of the Woman's Journal and writing for that paper, as well as innumerable leaflets, articles, newspaper letters and campaign pamphlets supplied the movement with much of its basic foundation of information and knew the needs of the American people. She was regarded as an outstanding ability. In the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom, vast information, fertile mind and dauntless spirit to mapping out the strategy which through the years carried the suffrage cause step by step to ultimate victory.

The instant the ballot was won, she took up the cause of education and organizing the needs of the new citizen. She became Honorary Chairman and an active board member of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.

In line with her family's pioneering interest in the field of women's education she has served Boston University, her alma mater, as a trustee since 1907.

Throughout these long years her sensitive humanity made her responsive to countless causes. Her warm cooperation with the American Friends of Russian Freedom. Her warm cooperation and friendship with Mrs. Catherine Breshkovsky extended over many years and included the editing of her autobiography "My Life".

The struggles of labor have equally enlisted her quick sympathies on countless occasions. Repeatedly she raises her voice against exploitation and the suppression of free speech, of the right to organize and of other civil liberties.

Devoted to world peace, she has sought during many years to turn her talents to its strenuous and difficult task. She has rendered English verse "Songs of Grief and Gladness" (Yiddish), "Songs of Russia", the Hungarian poems of Petőfi and "Some Spanish-American Poets", — the latter a monumental volume of over two hundred poems, opening to North Americans a new continent of literature. This work she still continues.

Not without justification was Miss Blackwell chosen last year to receive the annual medal given by the Ford Hall Forum to that citizen of Greater Boston who has made the most notable contribution to the welfare of the community. Though now in her eighties, frail and feeble, she has not been touched by the years, she continues her work with the zeal and enthusiasm of her eternally youthful spirit. Her tireless pen stands ever ready to aid the quest of freedom wherever and in whatever form it calls to her for help.
