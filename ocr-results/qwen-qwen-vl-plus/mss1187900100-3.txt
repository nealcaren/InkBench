I was on the 4th of October, the date you volunteered to sail from Brooklyn. Well, whateverelay it was, I clung to the little steamer taking me a lovely basket of fruit, & flowers first-rate, to dry both, and was told in broken English that your luggage had been sent down, and that your vessel soon arrived, & patiently watched each person.
