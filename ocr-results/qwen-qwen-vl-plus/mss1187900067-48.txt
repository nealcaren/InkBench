feel that I am growing old
am not now what I have
been - although time has
been quite generous with
me - you will see by
this letter that it harder
for me to write now then
in old times when my
nerves was steady
and strong - give they
kind regards to your
wife in which my good
heartly joins - Expect this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend and well-wisher
James N. Buffum

Ruth Says, come and see
us - I say Amen. You have
now an engagement not
fulfilled. Oct. 73
