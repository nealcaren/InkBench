**Fellowship Church Music**

A National Associate member of Fellowship Church remarked recently that it was wonderful to see the country join in the hymns of this particular congregation and to hear the singing of the Fellowship Choir. Beginning in the spring of 1946 as a sextet with an occasional soloist or processor, the choir has grown to a chorus of thirty voices. Its members form a unique, intercultural group of serious music students, many of whom are now training for concert careers. The choir is fortunate to be under the leadership of Corinne Barrow, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music in New York, France.

The Choir offers its distinctive vespers hours in recent months, continuing the Fellowship Church twilight series based on worship through the arts. They have given hours of poetry and music with Dr. Thurman as reader. Easter Sunday, 1947, they presented the Stabat Mater by Giuseppe Verdi. Recitals of the Choir are now available to members and friends over the country. May first the Choir secured as accompanist the services of Kay Sadagaya, Nisei concert pianist, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music in New York City.

The Chamber Quartet, composed of Caucasian, Chinese and Negro residents, renders a secular service. It enriches the musical life of Fellowship Church and contributes to the broad cultural interests of the City of San Francisco. Its programs, William Von Seiden, Ray Van Pelt, and William E. Van Pelt, have been sung at important functions including the annual dinner of the San Francisco Council for Civic Unity, the annual Lutheran Conference banquet, on many occasions for the wounded soldiers at Fort Riley, for the annual breakfast of Past Presidents of the California Employers Association held at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, and for the Vittoria Colonna, Italian woman's club.

Under the leadership of a special choir committee of the Fellowship Guild, with Katherine Laux as chairman, Jeanette Smith, director of the Choir, appeared at Temple Emanu-El on May 18 for presenting the Invocatory Lecture in beautiful new vestments. Ten of these robes were given by National Associate members especially concerned with Fellowship Church music. The internationally distinguished American baritone, Todd Duncan, contributed the first funds to establish a permanent Fellowship Choir as a personal expression of his interest and faith in the ideals to which they are giving practical expression.
