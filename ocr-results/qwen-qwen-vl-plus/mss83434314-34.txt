4. Requisitions for ordnance and ordnance stores, &c., not being entered in the book of "Letters Received," the memorandum preceding the endorsement will give the name of the officer making the requisition, the name of the company or post for which the stores are required, and the date of receipt of such requisition.

Where the endorsement on the requisition is a simple reference or a mere approval, it is not necessary to record it in full in this book; a memorandum showing the action taken being all that is required. Fig. 1 shows the mode of noting requisitions and subsequent action thereon.

5. Endorsements on letters, reports, &c., merely referring or forwarding such communications, need not be recorded in this book; a note (in red ink) in the book of "Letters Received," showing the disposition made of such communications, being all that is necessary. On recording a subsequent endorsement, however, (should any be made,) reference must be made to the first one, although not recorded.—See Fig. 2. In all other cases the endorsement will be recorded in full.

It sometimes happens that the endorsement made on a communication, at department or general headquarters, simply approves of the views contained in the endorsement of the post or regimental commander, &c., without stating what those views are; in which case, both endorsements must be recorded in the book, in order to give a perfect understanding of the import of the last endorsement.—See Fig. 3.

6. Endorsements on certificates of disability simply ordering the discharge of enlisted men, will not be recorded in this book. The fact of the discharge being ordered will be noted in the "Book of Discharges," which will be noticed presently. In all other cases the endorsement must be copied; the memorandum preceding the endorsement giving the name of the soldier concerned, the date and place from which such certificates were sent, and a brief description of the cause or causes for discharge. A note (in red ink) will also be made referring to the entry made in the "Discharge Book."—See Fig. 4.
