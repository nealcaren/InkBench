Dear Douglas,
I think the quotation at the head of your article a little bit off color. There is an appeal to mercy rather than to justice â€” I think the following from the same play is better.
"You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; You
take my life,
When you do take the means whereby I live."
You will pardon the repetition, that honor
debt.
