no difficulty in choosing your subject. The luncheon takes place at 1 o'clock P.M. and the length of time devoted to address is about an thirty-five minutes at znoct.

Please let me have a short sketch which we may use for publication in our newspapers, relating to yourself and your public work. We would like to have this by Thurs. A.M. of the coming week so it can be included in League Notes for next week.

Mr. Davis and I shall be very much pleased to have you as our guest while in our city.
