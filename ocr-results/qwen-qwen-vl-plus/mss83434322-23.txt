RECONSTRUCTION:
A LETTER FROM WILLIAM HEIGHTON TO GEORGE L. STEARNS.

ELMER, SALEM CO., N. J.
Feb. 27, 1865.

GEORGE L. STEARNS, ESQ., BOSTON, MASS.
Sir,
I lately received from you two communications, in which you advance certain propositions, and ask my influence and support for them.
1st. To organize the anti-slavery men of the country.
2d. To bring their combined influence to bear effectively upon the reconstruction of the social and political institutions of the Rebel States, and to remodel our financial system, in order to correct abuses growing out of slavery.
3d. To aid in procuring for Gov. Andrew, of Massachusetts, a seat in the Cabinet at Washington, as an able and faithful exponent of anti-slavery principles and measures.
I reply—I am not acquainted with the peculiar abnormal "system of civilization" growing out of slavery, nor aware that any champion of freedom might not be as proper a candidate for a seat in the Cabinet as Gov. Andrew. I would not shed lustre upon that position; but if I were to be of any service in an organization-whose object is to reconstruct the Rebel States, and re-unite them upon the basis of liberty and equal rights, you can put my name down upon your list.
That you may not mistake me, I will state a few fundamental propositions which I hold indispensable to that end.
1st. The profound essential equality of the human race. God made every father. All men are brothers, and the distinction between a man and a beast is infinite.
2d. The equality of rights. All human beings have equal rights to life, and liberty; 2d, the development and exercise of body, mind, and moral nature. The Government should secure these to the State, because its health, wealth, prosperity and highest happiness depend upon the full expression and enjoyment of them. 3d, the right to property in the common elements of nature,—light, air, water, and the land. The right to these elements is inalienable, because they constitute the elements of the human body, which could not exist a moment without them, and because they constitute the maintenance, in every age, of all the living beings. Man rules the universe. Give it an open field and fair play, and let the national will protected from sinister motives, and guided by the national intelligence, create and maintain this right.
The third clause of my second proposition—"the right to property in the common elements"—is so important that I beg, in conclusion, to call your attention to it. You will find the security of this right indispensable to the reconstruction of our southern communities. Immense landed estates, in a few hands (luxurious) in every other, are contrary to Democracy. If three or four men own a whole country, they will be its governors. Its road system, school system, court, judges, officers, municipality and gravitation, will all be controlled by them. This can and will ever under republican forms, secure their own election to the highest seats in the state and national councils, and become there, as in former years, an element of jarring and perpetual discord.
In New Jersey the ballot-box is, in effect, sometimes set up openly for sale to the highest bidder, and so many bought votes taken at the polls that the unbright ones are deemed of no value by the candidates. I have heard voters declare, how much they would like to vote for the poor man, that the only benefit they could see in the franchise to the poor man, is the money he gets for his vote. To be sure, these were foreigners. I never heard any have say this, though many sell their votes. This is the reason that some respectable voters excuse themselves from voting as useless. But ask those gentlemen who have money in their pockets what object they have to a negro vote, and nearly every man will rub up his eyes and lift his hands in holy horror, if you were to convince him of the unanswerable sin. Now I am not addressing these men. To reason with them would be ridiculous. Every anti-slavery man and political reformer will at once comprehend the justice and humanity of the following proposition.
In a conference held by Secretary Stanton and General Sherman with the colored people of Savannah, soon after that city was taken, the chosen spokesman of the negroes was Char-rison Frazier. On being asked, "How can your people take care of themselves?" he replied: "The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn and till it by our own labor." All this man's reply was necessary and well marked by uncommon shrewdness and good sense, but this excelled. How has a country who has got no home? Who habitually sells himself and his family for a day or a week to get bread for his family? In the days you wish to uproot slavery, break up land monopoly. Twin strands of one rope, slavery in some form will ever feed its insatiate maw upon stolen labor, and a long and mad monoply will be allowed to exist. The new freedom of the south, under the old land monopoly will be worse to the feeble and decrepit than their former slavery. Strung with poverty and degradation, with blind rage and malignant hate will vent their spleen on the innocent and helpless freedman, and, charging him with being the cause of their woes, an oppressive unrighteousness, times of succeeding slavery, will grind him to powder. God help the poor ignorant negroes, who without any home, or legal claim to the elements of life, shall be compelled, day by day, after his labor, to give bread for his wife and children! No, the government that shall permit land monopoly to wield its blighting curse over four millions of ignorant and helpless blacks with the false and highest obligations of absolute despotism to the black race, to be again engulfed, at some future period, in its own blood.
If you anti-slavery gentlemen who are forming an organization to reconstruct the rebel States, will be wanting in intelligence to comprehend the magnitude of this great land question, let me admonish you that you are not qualified for the duty you propose to do. I make this statement, because the idea is not embraced in your printed communications.
In this letter I send you my political daquer-roteypo,-Democratic and Republican in every feature. If you conclude it will not disgrace your anti-slavery gallery, you will hang it up there among the rest.

PURITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE BALLOT-BOX.
"First pure." Bible says, "A corrupt use of the ballot-box is not Democracy, but an aristocracy (money rule) of the most odious kind. The purity therefore of the franchise should be guarded by the severest possible laws. Hence, to go to the polls, and secure a conviction of the offender with imprisonment at hard labor, and partial loss of franchise for the first offence, and total loss for the second, would probably accomplish that end.
Particulars of election, — withdraw all sinister motives to a corrupt vote. Make the vote the simple expression of the uncorrupted sense and will of the voter,
