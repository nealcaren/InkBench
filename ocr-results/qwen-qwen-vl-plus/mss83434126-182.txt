exhaustion & thirst, and portions of those Regiment-mares
the cies, broke caaks rushed to it alone, alongside, and
after slaking their thirst returned to their Eden and u-
sained the fight, But the resistance of the Federal troops
became weak, human nature could endure no more,
A decisive victory seemed about to crown the efforts of
the rebels, at this critical moment a deliverance suddenly appeared,
Genl. McClellan signalled to the Federal gunboats
to open fire on the enemy, from their ponderous shells
bowed amongst them whole caaks were battered to the
earth. confusion quickly spread through their columns,
and they who a few moments before, were confident of
victory, were themselves compelled to give way,
Genl. Stuart-Gelman determined to recover the fortunes of
the day, by making a desperate charge. The gunboats
were ordered to cease firing. This veteran collapsed
from column to column and cheered his men to the
attack, the enemy met them with firmness, but had
gradually to give way, their lines soon broke, and
eventually fled fled from the field in confusion. The
rebels previously captured a large number of Cannon,
big portions of the batteries of Randal, Molt, Aspe.
The goal of the Campaign was reached in safety, and
the soldiers of the Union, saved the honor of the
nation with the blood of its patriots.
