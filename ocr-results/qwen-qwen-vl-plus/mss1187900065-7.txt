And sin-wrecked man with rags
Did graft each golden word,
And with my heart I knew them on
To see my gracious Lord

Again, I stood beside the gates
My heart was glad and free,
For with me stood a ransom'd thing
The Lord had given me.

F. C. W. Hunter.

Growing old,
The prison house in which I live
Is falling to decay,
But—God reveals my Spirit's strength
Within—Make a alls of clay.

For me a dimness slowly creeps
Around Earth's faint light—
But Heaven grows closer to my view
And nearer to my sight.
