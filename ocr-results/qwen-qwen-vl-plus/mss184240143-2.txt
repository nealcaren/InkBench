New York, Feb 21st 1879

My dear Mr. Dickinson,
I am afraid your business affairs are again suffering. You have met the "part" Cal ever did to come most nights. "Nice a man as smil'd for "Can't Keep a Hotel." I am sorry, think how I ingrained your box unit John McCauley. It might have been now in a different position.
You told me you would see me about your theatrical business. The way I hear you have "a Boy" (as it were) dotting upon your affairs * "mixing them child up." I thought you had a dear experience before with "Audem managers" that learned by experience the Queen of Management. Don't think I am seducing you only that I feel slighted. I came to New York for you then any man in this business * or out of it for that matter. Owned (or not) have done it cheerfully
