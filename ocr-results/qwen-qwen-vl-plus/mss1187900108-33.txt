Cuthbert, Ga., 189

Printed given your hands
of the Census, I wish you
would send me one of them.
Now Mrs. Bangsback,
I wish you to do me this favor
as I have spent a great deal
of money this year for the
Republican Cause. And is now
greatly in debt for the same.
And the Republican Executive
Committee have sent a petition
to Mr. Granamans, Postly, Ga.
asking the Appointment of
Mr. Charles Tanton, to the
Postoffice at this place
(Cuthbert Ga.) This will help
me to secure my home for
the money spent for the cause.
