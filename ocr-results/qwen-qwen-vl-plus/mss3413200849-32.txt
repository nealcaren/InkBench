You may have already seen - if so, just destroy them - This one - pasted below - struck me as particularly lovely. I wonder if you knew Dr. Lewis....?

Here I told you that since May 1st we have had Elevator service only sparsely, and that for our Monday next to the end of the process

MEMORIAL SET UP TO DR. EMILY LEWIS
Friends of the late Dr. Emily Lewis presented a check for $14,000 yesterday to the trustees of the New York Infirmary to start an endowment fund in her memory. Income will be used for the care of ailing women physicians connected with the infirmary and their children.
The check was presented to Mrs. Frank Vanderlip, president of the board of trustees, by Marion Mantler, medical director of the infirmary, at the end of a meeting of the trustees in the Fuller Building, Madison Avenue.
Mrs. Vanderlip said of Dr. Lewis: "She was one of the older doctors who had the courage of their convictions and the consecration to uphold the infirmary as a center of training for women doctors. Without her work and that of her associates the infirmary would long since have closed its doors."
Dr. Lewis, who died two years ago, was a pediatrician who practiced in the infirmary and served as director of pediatrics at the infirmary from 1930 to 1936. She was known as an outstanding teacher and as a researcher, and one of the pioneers in endocrinology.
One room in the projected new infirmary building will be known as the Emily Lewis Memorial Room, the trustees said, and the endowment will support it.
