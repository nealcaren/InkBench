Night Letter

To St Francis Hotel
San Francisco
New York, November 17th, 1919.

The 18 signed checks have arrived C.K. I have my eye on the mortgage falling due on the old home. There are dramatic possibilities if we only had a good villain in the background who gives you the alternative between foreclosure and marriage, the while he walks down stage and himself'll break you yet me proud beauty!! I shall of course keep you advised on this matter.

Miss Hay forwarded under date of November 15th a cable from Miss Macmillan addressed to you:

"Cable from London signed Macmillan quote Spanish invitation received send your full report to convention in this for December 1st Also send by mail draft circular letter appealing for funds for convention"

This I followed by a telegram of my own summarizing the returns on the vote as below:

"US officers vote yes stop no returns from Central Powers stop Holland France Denmark Sweden vote yes stop Switzerland agrees if majority affiliated societies favor Spain stop Holland strongly objects on ground of limited attendance and passport difficulties preventing some countries from sending delegates Holland proposes Congress in some central neutral country followed by special meeting in Madrid for all who can obtain passports Am sending full report foreign correspondence to San Francisco"

Several of the voting slips include currents as follows:

Schluemberger as officer and president:
"Yes very willingly in principle. There should be, notwithstanding, a meeting before the Board of Officers for which we have already voted."

Bargman: "I think this is the best proposal that has been made so far. It appeals to me tremendously, though I am not blind to the drawbacks, especially the increase in the traveling expenses which will be felt very heavily by people living in this part of the world."

Switzerland: "If the majority of the associations affiliated to the Alliance pronounce for Spain we yield. But we would very much prefer a meeting in Switzerland. Our country is incredibly backward in the matter of women suffrage and we are precisely at the psychological moment when a great effort should be made. And as with us, it is the masculine electors and not parliaments, who must recognize our rights, nothing could have so much weight on public opinion as having a Congress"
