Hon. Fred Douglass,
Dear Sir,
Francis M. Adelington of Weymouth, Mass., 86 years of age, sends the following offering for the Lincoln Monument inauguration:
"Father Abraham's Monument."
This Monument would seem to say
That Lincoln's dead, but 'tis not so.
In vain the apathetic arm to slay;
In vain his blood was made to flow.
In vain the vile attempt to kill.
In all our hearts, he's living still.
And while a drop of patriotic blood
Shall flow in any human frame,
Will thrill at memory of the good
The great and noble Lincoln name.
This Monument we raise to thee,
Great Chief whose mandate made us free.
Our grateful thanks to Heaven ascend
For thee, our true and constant friend.
Also the following
"Adieu to America Personified"
The world is gazing on thee.
Dispose thy robes with care
And with thy precious jewels
Adorn thy golden hair.
"Over"
