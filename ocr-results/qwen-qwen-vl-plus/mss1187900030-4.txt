Department— but have not received an answer yet. The peer and O night. It has been beautiful weather ever since you left— and I do not think we will have much snow but it will be new and sharp. Elizabeth is making preparations to read her lecture next Monday night and leave us on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. I believe she has more made by other appointments yet— but I think it will be attended to. The writing in the schoolroom and the few who have brought their dinners are as full of sleep as possible. I hope you will have a comfortable time as possible and that you will not return homesick. Old Brown will have to keep out of sight for a little while. The Governor of Missouri has a reward of $5000 offered for his capture and Hamilton has given himself up.

Mother wishes me to give her love and enclosed you will find a note from Elizabeth and perhaps Annie will send a few lines.

Your affectionate daughter,
Rosette Duryea
