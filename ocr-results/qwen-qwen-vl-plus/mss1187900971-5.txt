Grandpa was never called "Frederick Bailey the Slave." He was first Frederick Bailey. Changed to Johnson when he ran away and because the man in whose home he lived in New Bedford, Mass., was named Johnson. Thomas, who had just finished reading "The Lady of the Lake," admired so much the character in the book named "Douglas," asked Grandpa to keep from confusing their two Johnson names, thus he would like to call himself Douglas instead of Johnson. Grandpa told him one name was as good as another and henceforth set out to be called Frederick Douglass. These are facts—not hearsay.

Later—Just read a letter from Fred—he leaves on his "debating tour" to-day—and really debates at Harvard. He will stop with era! I've already met Joe's wife & Mamie and met Crawford.
