wider public of readers,--hope
that it will have the good
effect of keeping the Negroes
of the North from deserting
the Republican Party;--a
decisive step it will be for

unanswerable arguments clearly
show; these arguments, coming
from you, must have great weight
with the Colored people, who are
the ones you specially want to
influence by them. So though
relieved from office you are
working away with all your old
power. I hope that you are
lukewarm upon the winter in
good health,--that you will
not run any risks by travelling
or lecturing till summer comes
again. When you last wrote
you were in some anxiety
about one of your sons, who was
ill. I hope that he has long ago
recovered,--that all your family
are well. I hoped that the book
of Prof. Carpenter's sermons
and a few other writings, which
my nephew Prof. Dolph Carpenter
of Oxford is editing, would have
been out by this time,--but it
will be days or later before it
appears; it is entitled "Personal
& Social Christianity" and is
prefaced by a short memoir
by Wip. F.L. Cooke.
