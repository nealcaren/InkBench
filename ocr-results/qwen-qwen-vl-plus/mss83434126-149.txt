The division of Van Dorn retreated in one direction, that of Price escaped by another. The pursuit was continued by Genl. Sigel toward Reitherville, and by the cavalry to the mountains, the rout of the enemy was complete. Rebel loss 2000 killed and wounded also 1000 prisoners, among the rebel dead was found Genl. M.
