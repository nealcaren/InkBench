Dear Mrs. Brown:

I can't let your note about Miss Blackwell go unanswered, even
though the check I owed the $200 must be omitted.

I have always admired Miss Blackwell, and, in late years, have loved her
especially. Her always beautiful Christmas and Easter messages, and her
indomitable spiritual grace are such lovely additions to the great background of her life work.

It wounds my heart to know that she, too, is facing a financial vacuum. There are so many who are!
I am one of them myself, or, of course, I would share in making the fund which you are raising. Being a starving artist is a most painful handicap, in every way, but it is particularly hard to endure, when it appears like this.

Thank you for including me as one of her friends, which I most heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett
