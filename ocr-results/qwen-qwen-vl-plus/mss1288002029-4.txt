"The governor means right," said Mrs. Howe. "He means that, in view of the indignity and injustice of the infliction necessitated by the law, the women may very well have already suffered enough."
"Do you agree with the Governor in his implication that universal suffrage may prove to be an unfortunate experiment?"
"That is a very different matter to speak of officially," replied Mrs. Howe. "Is who has the right to determine whether universal suffrage is good, but such a matter of such evident and positive right should be submitted to the chance of a popular vote."
"What would the effect be, do you think, of such a vote?"
"But now you see that, if we settle the question officially, it turns out in our favor, we can do nothing more than a year's experiment. If it goes against us, nothing is gained in anybody, and nothing is lost. If it stands found to do us of right I don't think it should commit."
re "VOTE FOR AN EQUAL VOTE."
"How would the majority of the women vote on this question were it submitted to their vote?"
"I should feel very uncertain about that. Women who are not well educated go against it, and while I do not wish to do the poorer classes a wrong, I believe that a great many of them would not support the measure. There are also a good many women in any class who would fear to disappoint their husbands, brothers or sons, and would vote against it. All women graduates of colleges and all professional women would vote for it."
"Do you like the Governor's plan of post-office experiment of voting for school suffrage at the annual post-office meetings? I have considered it unpleasant or improper for a woman to go there and do her ballot. There is also the possibility of falsification, women should vote as men do."
"What, in your judgment is the outlook?"
"The outlook is very favorable, and particularly the great increase of the study of sociological and economic facts in all every country in the direction of woman suffrage, in spite of what individuals may do or think."
