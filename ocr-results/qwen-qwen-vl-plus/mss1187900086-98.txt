Dear Frederick Douglass,
When we first saw your appointment to Hoyt, and also how many kind and beautiful things the newspapers were saying about you, I began to clip and stick them with the intention of sending them all on to youâ€”I cut "lots" of them, but alas! in the large piles of editorial scraps they have all disappeared, but here I enclose.
It was pleasant to see the appreciation in which you are held, while I am alive to see it. I am not sure that we are glad to have you Ed. We need you here.
