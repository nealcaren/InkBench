FREEDMEN'S BUREAU.

ing thirst for knowledge is manifested by the colored people; children give earnest attention and learn rapidly, and the adults, after the day's work, often devote the evening to study.

Marriages have been recorded and orphans supplied with homes to some extent.

SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.

General Rufus Saxton had, as you are aware, been during most of the war in charge of matters pertaining to freedmen in South Carolina. The operations of the war enabled me to visit Beaufort and St. Helena islands during the winter of 1864-'65, and I was pleased with the settlement, labor, regulations, and thriving schools that I found in existence under his direction and supervision. Several thousand negro refugees, which have been before described as following our armies, were received by him, for the most part, in a state of utter destitution, distributed upon different vacant lands, and cared for until they became self-sustaining. Judging by his past success of the general's fitness for a large work, I gave to his charge South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida temporarily. Colonel Osborne, the Assistant Commissioner for the latter State, met with a serious accident while en route to his post, which detained him for a couple of months. Owing to sickness, General Saxton was delayed in extending his organization into the interior. A few officers and agents, however, proceeded as early as June to Augusta and farther west in Georgia. Lately, South Carolina and Georgia have been completely organized. From South Carolina reports from the interior of the State are replete with instances of violence and cruelty towards the freedmenâ€”murders, whipping, tying up by the thumbs, defrauding of wages, over-working, combining for purposes of extortion, &c. From my own observation, I do not infer that such crimes and cruelties give a true picture of the state of society. Yet the criminal list is altogether too great to pass unnoticed. Already the antagonism between whites and blacks in this State is marked, and for the sake of peace and good order it would be unwise at present to withdraw the military force. The number of dependents drawing rations in South Carolina and Georgia, at the end of September, was 10,664; the number of schools, 114; number of teachers, 174; of scholars, 9,500.

A very large number of contracts were made for last year by the military authorities, and none by the bureau. Those planters who lived on the line of General Sherman's march have been obliged to struggle against many difficulties in raising a crop this year, having little material left to work with. Thus they were unable to make contracts as favorable to the freedmen as they could otherwise have done. The Assistant Commissioner finds great difficulty in getting parties to enter into them for the next year. He reports affairs in Darlington, Williamsburg, and Marion districts in better condition than elsewhere. The freedmen here are self-supporting, and there is little or no conflict between blacks and whites. A pass and patrol system is still kept up in Barnwell district. The department commander had his headquarters at Hilton Head; General Saxton his at Beaufort, and finally at Charleston, and the provisional governor was in the northern part of the State. Hence there has been much separate and some conflicting action on the part of these officers, and many misunderstandings. I believe, now that the department commander and Assistant Commissioner are both at Charleston, and co-operating, more complete order and confidence will be the result. In this State the feeling is general against the presence of colored troops. It is alleged that its effect is to disturb labor throughout a large district in the vicinity of the garrison, and the fear is expressed by the white inhabitants that the colored troops will join the negroes in case of insurrection.
