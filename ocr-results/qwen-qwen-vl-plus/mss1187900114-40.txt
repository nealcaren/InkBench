Life and escape from bondage
for me to sell, saying, if I sold
them I should have one volume
to rep for my reward. I think
I sold ten volumes. They were
published by Joseph Barker
of Leeds, Yorkshire. I kept my
book until 1857 and some
one stole it and never have
I seen one like it since.

The remembrance of all the above
notes prompts me to solicit you and your wife to
a trial visit. I have been
searching for days to find out
your abiding home and failed
correctly to get it until yesterday.
And not a line from you will
give me pleasure to say when,
where, and at what time you can
receive a call from me on yourself
and wife (whom I have not met)
our homes are not far apart Salem, Ohio
Do you remember Benjamin Born a wife
old Anti Slavery State Ohio. They had an underground
daughter. She married John Deming
Mr. Brokens daughter is married to her too
at Salem, Ohio. The Deming's have an exhibit
in Manufactory Hall. My husband has been
ill and have not yet got to the fair. Saw
through my glass on dedication day in
your Amusing your Earl answer with best
wishes July yours Henrietta Harris
