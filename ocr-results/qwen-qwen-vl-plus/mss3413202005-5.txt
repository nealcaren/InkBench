"When I first saw the light of day on this planet, it seemed as if I had been rudely awakened from a death like sleep. How well I remember the conversation between the doctor and my father as they handed me over to the nurse.

I remember looking back at my mother's face at that moment. The pain and anguish it was burnt into by plastic brain, and often during the subsequent I would watch as she sucked me. Somehow she was impelled to talk to me, not as a child, but as her own heart, pouring out all her woman's desires, and bemoaning her failures.

I remember well how the silent prayers, when her lips were moving to stir my heart; and as I look back over the years from childhood to maturity, I realize that there was some subtle power of transmutation at work, for somehow, from the very first moment I seemed to know all the future without being able to give any expression in words.

Victoria moved away any doubt about being a woman of destiny. In the autobiographical sketch, written in 1865, in London, with her active years far behind her, she told of a vision she had seen in her childhood days and the message it gave her from the occult world.

"I remember," she said, "one night when all was silent, the great old oak by the fireplace was sending out over the room in which we, my sisters and I were sleeping, a shadowy light. Suddenly I saw an enormous black and -hot dog enter the room and walking to the fireplace disappear, whilst I lay there wondering what it all meant.

"I was conscious of the presence of some living being near me. In a moment a tall, dark man stood beside me. He was asleep, and walked out in the open air, when I looked at his face, it was radiant with divine wisdom. He told me I should play a part in ushering in the new order of things, which would be understood and acted upon before the close of the 19th century."

Victoria was 18 years old, and contacted the first of her three husbands, Henry Ward Beecher (Woodhull), a physician, when she used to accompany on his visits to patients. She used to say that this experience roused in her a desire to emancipate women from the shackles of ignorance and to make maternity more intelligent.

After the birth of a second child she divorced Woodhull, and with her younger sister, Tommie, began the study of law in her father's office.

At 32 Victoria took her second husband, James W. Blood, and soon became nationally known as a crusader.

Her views which would hardly startle the world now, were shocking in her day. She was considered inferior to men and were exempted never to appear on the street except under male protection. Once Victoria violating a rule, appeared at Belmont's without an escort. When told she could not be served, she went out and brought in her cab driver.

Various motives were given for her appearance in Wall street. It has been said that she wanted to open the avenue of business to women, and demonstrate that her sex was as competent as the male. Another version is that she wanted to reveal from first-hand experience the corruption in the business world under male domination. Still another explanation is that she wanted to raise money for her Presidential campaign.

Anyway the innovation upset the city of New York. Reporters camped on the trail of Victoria and Tenney. Crowds for the curious flocked to the office of Woodhull, Clarin & Co. "The Lady Brokers," were a sensation. The press was quick to decide that they had the financial backing of Commodore Vanderbilt.

Fourteen months after she entered business, Victoria made her dash into public life.

She prepared a memorial, an argument for votes for women and presented it to both houses of Congress. The House referred it to the Judiciary Committee and ordered it printed. Victoria's contention was that by the 14th and 15th Amendments, women were citizens and had the right to vote.

On January 13, 1861, she argued her case with great eloquence before the Judiciary Committee of the House. She was the first woman to address Congress on a suffrage issue. Ben Butler was one of those she converted. He championed her cause.

Thence forward, Victoria became the militant leader in the suffrage fight. In the election of 1871, in New York city, with her sister and others, she went to an election booth and insisted that she be allowed to vote. Her militancy brought her into conflict with Tammany and the police.

In 1872, the so-called Equal Rights party held a convention in New York attended by 500 delegates from 26 States and four Territories. The convention nominated Victoria for President of the United States and she ended her campaign in Baltimore for which she was for limiting a President to a single term, reform in the Civil Service, an eight-hour day for labor, and prison reform.

Her campaign collapsed, and was soon overwhelmed by the events which carried Victoria and Tenney into jail and the law courts. She started their magazine Woodhull and Cliffton's weekly. From the beginning it was sensational. Its circulation jumped rapidly.

Stung by opposition, the crusading sisters had undertaken to expose hypocrisy.

The story about Henry Ward Beecher had been circulated by the gossip of the time.

In her lectures Victoria Woodhull had been discussing sex with great frankness. "The Human Body, the Temple of God," was the title of one of her lectures. She was bitterly attacked by the guardians of morality. At one time hotels were closed to her. She was seized with difficulty in finding a place to live. Finally she went with her husband, Blood, to occupy a house in the Murray Hill section of New York.

While she was there she was arrested for the publication of the Beecher story.

She had sought several times to enlighten the public on this matter. She had given her story to reporters, and repeated it in Boston at a national convention of Spiritist, which elected her president. But the daily press would not print it. So in her magazine Victoria screamed all the louder about "Sunday School morality and pulpit pharisees."
