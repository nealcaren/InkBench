Dear Mrs. Terrell:

Nor can I tell you how genuinely delighted I was to receive your beautiful letter. Yes, I knew that Oberlin was going to confer on you a richly merited honorary degree and I was thrilled for still another reason, namely, my daughter, Florence, graduated from Oberlin three years ago and naturally has a sentimental attachment for this great institution. She was also a dear friend, Henry J. Haskell, chief editorial writer and one of the publishers of the Kansas City Star is a Trustee of Oberlin as were his first wife, Isabel, and his second wife, Katharine, sister of Orville Wright. In the Hall of Fame Museum in Oberlin there is a beautiful memorial which Haskell established in memory of Katharine.

I do hope the Judge's decision in the case of the American Association of University Women will be favorable and I will be so grateful if you will inform me of the outcome.

My wife joins me in sending fond regards to you. As ever

Cordially yours,

Jacob Billikoff

Dear Mrs. Terrell:

May we ask you to take a moment or two to read the enclosed leaflet which deals with one of our critical problems -- inequality of educational opportunity for 10% of America's citizens.

It is not too much to say that upon the 32 colleges represented in the United Negro College Fund rests the major responsibility for supplying wise and capable leadership--ministers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, teachers--from our 14,000,000 Negro citizens.

These are not wealthy colleges; their students come mainly from low-income families. Tuition fees are necessarily low; endowments pitifully small; but their costs have increased just as yours and ours have. So it is necessary to provide funds to bridge the gap between income and operating expenses. The Fund was founded to meet that need, and for five years now has successfully kept these colleges operating at least at minimum efficiency.

This money is used to provide increased faculty for the largest enrollment in the schools' history--31,000 students; for more books and library services; scholarship aid to deserving students; class-room and laboratory equipment, and other essentials. Without these things the colleges cannot serve their students well; without the aid of the Fund, these needs cannot be met.

A gift to the Fund does immediate good for many, in many places. It will pay dividends in enriched individual lives and a more unified America. It will bring you the satisfaction of offering a helping hand to those who are striving eagerly to climb upward.

Will you join the more than 50,000 Americans who now make the United Negro College Fund one of their regular philanthropies?

Sincerely yours,

J. L. Burling
