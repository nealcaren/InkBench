all this disagreeable experience, to be
believed by those I would help, that fully know
their trouble, could not but make common cause
with them. - If so it is but a beggarly disguise!
And now let me add that in Easter eve I
was sought by the Director of New Institute
prentised in anvend paper, to tell me he had
proof that "Philanthropic wine" as he called it
could be found in the North (in fact had been
offered) at low interest for such nick work as had
hunted. To which he added the suggestion
mentioned and attracted my attention to Part 4, Page 1 of the
Chicago Daily Interim of 25 March giving an account
of a successful colored colonization at Tuskegee,
Alabama - to which I refer you, as due to interest
you. It is a number of 62 pages printed at
immense cost of copies, as its 21st anniversary, which
claims very interesting items about the Columbian
Fair. When upon this I heard of your work
I thought I could not but write you if only to
ask your opinion and counsel how best to proceed.
I feel none of your sympathy for the cause,
perhaps "and long may it remain, hopefully
with very best wishes of the reason for your
continued prosperity, from Sir
most truly yours
