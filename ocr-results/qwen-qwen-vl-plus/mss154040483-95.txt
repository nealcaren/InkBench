"Party Clean-ups Are
the Crying Need"
Says
Carrie Chapman Catt
Distinguished Suffrage Leader

Mrs. Catt

WANTED, feminism in politics, Emily Newell Blair
says so; Mrs. Blair, sunny-tempered, once one time hopeful,
confesses herself (in her recent Journal articles) to be pessimistic and discouraged about
women in politics. Her own seven years' experience and hard work as vice-chairman of the
National Democratic Committee.
She admits that women vote, sit in
convention committees, but instead of supporting independently
their own ideas and policies, she charges
that they have been widely guilty of
merely doing what men want them to do and of voting as men direct them.
Mrs. Blair finds that women have created
no progressive action for their party, that women form no bloc of
political power.
Perhaps. But there is a twin complaint
and one should not be made without the
other. Many of us, more women, fail to
support independently their own ideas and policies and they walk up the chalk
line to vote exactly as their higher-ups
tell them to; in fact men and women
behaved exactly alike. This fact that the
comment should be confined to the
admission that the great masses of men and women have not really
come up yet and are not yet in leading strata.
A Republican woman in high political
leadership has been known to express
views so similar to Mrs. Blair's as to
reveal the fact that the same sad thing
that has happened in one party has also
occurred in the other.
Mrs. Blair suggests that the remedy is
the fostering of more feminism. I
believe this is the comment of the other
party also. Mrs. Blair says there are
two ways only in which women may
become effective in political
organizations. Either or both calls for more
feminism.
But is the feminism a revival of some-
thing we once had or is it a brand-new
attitude for which no doubt politics is
yearning? Personally, while I agree
with Mrs. Blair in many of her com-
ments, I do not think her diagnosis is
correct.
S O the years passed. Votes were
bought, nominations were engineered,
legislation was passed or lost
by political parties. The parties
degenerated into politicians, poor men made
fortunes in politics, and the price of
elections has flown so high that it must
wither the spirit of the nation.
There is a Tammany Hall in New
York, a Republican machine in Chicago,
Boston, and Philadelphia, which is even
worse. Neither men nor women have
seriously attempted to remove the
dishonorable use of money, corruption,
fraud and indecent attempts to cover up
the naked things that have been done.
No temporary political and local masci-
linity in or out of politics can contribute
much to American self-government until
the voters within the nation drop
every vestige of their trust in them-
selves to the institution of honesty and
decency in the administration of party
politics. We shall never be a great na-
tion, nor shall any of us ever
be worthy of the respect of our
citizens and their neighbors, until this
housecleaning is thoroughly done. Every
dishonest trick, every over-expenditure,
