**LETTER FROM CITY POINT.**

T. C. P.

It has long been the boast of all rival relief societies, that they possessed the advantage of direct and personal contact with the men; and it is a lamentable fact, that people at home overlook to a great extent, the operations of the Sanitary Commission in this respect. We do communicate personally with the sufferers. To make this statement more forcible, I will endeavor to sketch the working of the

A. X. C.

What volumes are contained in these three symbolistic characters. The "God bless you's" of men made happy by a gift from home; the tears of gratitude for some simple act of kindness; the resurrections from filth and despondency into cleanliness and hope.

These three letters mean the "Auxiliary Relief Corps." They were instituted by the founder of the Corps, Mr. Frank B. Fay, of Massachusetts, and will long be held as mementos of an experience, at once pleasant and profitable.

We, of the Corps, number about thirty-five men, and from three to six of us, are connected with each hospital at this point. We have a storehouse in each hospital, receiving our supplies from a central or general storehouse at City Point. The hospitals are divided into wards, and each agent has an assigned ward, to the men of which he gives out his goods. This is the practical working of the Corps in their stations. In case of a battle, men are immediately selected from our number, and sent to the field with supplies of stimulants, good wholesome eatables, and good warm clothing. Oh, I shall never forget, when once I was among the number called to go to Deep Bottom, just after a battle in Butler's lines. The surgeons were almost all occupied with the amputating tables,--three in number, and the minor cases were left mostly to the care of some members of the Christian Commission and ourselves. For two days and two nights, the men came pouring in, and as fast as they were examined and attended to, put on board the hospital boats, to be shipped to the regular stations. And I think that I can safely say, that not a man went from the battlefield to the boat, without passing through our hands. The working, in detail, would occupy more space and time, than we can afford: it is nearly as various, both in character and effect, as the men with whom we come in contact. One cannot appreciate it though, without having personal connection with it.

**MEETING OF AGENTS.â€”HON. F. B. FAY.**

A meeting of the Auxiliary Relief Corps, of the U. S. Sanitary Commission, was held on Monday evening, December 19, at the Ninth Corps Depot Hospital, for the purpose of listening to the parting address of its Superintendent, the Hon. Frank B. Fay, of Chelsea, Mass.

Mr. Fay having been connected with this part of the Commission's work from its origin, the parting was filled with reminiscences of the many sad and sacred scenes through which the Corps had passed.

The following preamble and resolutions were presented, and unanimously adopted, as expressing the sentiments of the Corps, towards its founder and friend, to whom the cause owes so much.

Whereas, The Hon. Frank B. Fay, Superintendent of the Auxiliary Relief Corps of the U. S. Sanitary Commission, is retiring to his home, at the close of a long and arduous period of service in the field, with the expectation of being separated for a time from the Corps, with which he has been identified since its inception.

Resolved, That the Corps of Relief Agents, take this opportunity of expressing to Mr. Fay, the high appreciation of his services, and of the self-sacrificing spirit which, ever since the beginning of the war, has led him to enlist in the work of ministering to our sick and wounded heroes.

Resolved, That a copy of these proceedings be forwarded to the Executive Committee in New York, and to the SANITARY COMMISSION BULLETIN, in Philadelphia, for publication.
