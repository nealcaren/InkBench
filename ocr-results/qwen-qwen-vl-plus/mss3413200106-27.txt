Dear Miss Blackwell,
I am blessed with a propensity to be always at something. You are something; still you will not draw an illogical conclusion, as three successive spitters might tempt a less reasonable creature to do.
The truth is, it's hot; hot beyond creed, to pay nothing of debt. What resource else was left but you? The other evening, so & so was spoken of to me as having done this and that as nurse in the war. I was called on to admire her. I had to say yes, I admire what she did. But must she not be a noble woman to do so much. Then I said it's my will for us you and she & me, to do good. No the only recommendation we can have, But really I look to see one who need no creed to recommend him. Seeing whom one thinks not how much he has done or can do, but how much he is.
I perceive I was talking Greek, & not us furlough; but you who understand Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
