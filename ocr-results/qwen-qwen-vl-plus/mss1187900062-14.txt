Hartford, Connecticut,
If the colored leaders take
to denouncing the Supreme Court,
they will alienate the sympathy
of their best friends in the North.
The abolition of slavery; the
prohibition of discriminating
State laws; the extension of
the ballot to the colored man;
these are secure. If the colored
leaders denounce any folly for
not also punishing by law, the
deauthorizing and absurd exclusion
of colored people from
particular private societies
kinds of hotels & theatres it
will look rather childish. It
will tend to show that the colored
people can move for the show
than for the substance of citizenship.
