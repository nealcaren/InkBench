London, Sunday May 6, 94.
Dear Mr. Douglass:
Your letter directed to Manchester has followed me all around till it reached me here. I am indeed glad to get it. When I wrote to you I had not seen your letter to Dr. [???]; since seeing it I know from what he and others said, that while they did not expect "quah" (may they pay you the same compliment I do, in knowing you to be incapable of such a thing), still they would have been better satisfied if you had spoken more positively regarding me and my work. Mr. [???] thought that since the Society had failed so miserably and I was thus left [???] for myself, you would not hesitate to [???] for me. We cannot go to the country telling people about this personal quarrel and why I am unaccompanied by the person who brought me over. As the [???] member of the race, a positive letter or voucher,
