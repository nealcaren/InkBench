Boston Dec: 25th
My dear Miss Dickinson
Your favor of the 14th containing a draft for five hundred dollars came safely to hand; and I should have acknowledged its receipt at once. Trust it was found both Learie and myself to all we do even so little. We are more active and hope to continue so's at all events we shall try. Kate Mary thanks you for your letter.
Learie sends much love to you & your Mother
Ever yours truly
C.W.Braekeitt
