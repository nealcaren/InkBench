JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Libe'ria, a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1820 by the American Colonization Society (now the Colonization Soc.), and established as an independent state in 1847, being a territory of 40,000 square miles and stretching along the Atlantic from the Sherboro River on the N. W., to the Pedro River on the S. E., a distance of about 1000 miles, extending inland to the borders of Guinea, 60 miles. Its area, which is steadily increased by purchases from the native tribes, was estimated in 1890 at 14,000 square miles. The country is generally level, but otherwise low, generally sandy or gravelly, seldom marshy. In the interior the country rises, swelling into forest-covered hills and lofty mountains, ranging towards the Gulf of Guinea. Many streams flow to the sea, but none of them is navigable for more than 20 miles from the mouth; the most important are the St. Paul, navigable for 18 miles, and the rivers of the Cape Mount, Cape Palmas, and its mouth; the St. John, the Junk, and the Cape Mount River. The climate is thoroughly tropical. Of the two seasons, the wet season begins in October and lasts until June; in the dry season the thermometer seldom rises above 90° F. in the shade; in the wet season the thermometer never falls below 60°. To the white man the climate is deadly—not from its excessive heat, but probably from the malaria which it produces. The natives, who are reared in another climate, suffer on their arrival here from so-called African fever. The natives, on the contrary, are accustomed to a tropical climate. The soil is generally very fertile. The principal factor of the country is the sugar-cane of the St. Paul. Here the sugar-cane grows luxuriantly; the crop's produce was estimated at 300,000 pounds. Cotton is also cultivated with success in the interior. Coffee of excellent quality is cultivated with success in the interior. The cereals, maize, rice, wheat, barley, and oats; the vegetables, potatoes, turnips, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.; and the fruits, lemons, oranges, guavas, tamarindes, pomegranates, pineapples, African peaches, etc., are easily cultivated. The timber is abundant, and consists of mahogany, poplar, several kinds of gum trees, dyewoods, medicinal shrubs, and different varieties of useful palms, among which the oil-palm is the most important from which palm oil is made. Wild animals, the elephant, hippopotamus, lion, leopard, etc., are now nearly exterminated. Of minerals, iron ore is found in abundance, and gold is said to occur in the interior. The inhabitants of the republic are divided into the largest estimates, about 1,068,000, of whom about 18,000 are free laborers, and the rest natives. The natives belong to the Mandingos, among whom the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U. S. has established a mission school at Fofowreh; the Pessehs, who are the most numerous, are under the American Baptist missionaries established a mission in 1832; the Krahn, mostly idolaters; the Mandingos, the most gifted with intellect, under the American Baptist missionaries; and others. The Americo-Liberians have a regular system of schools, and are progressing in all branches of civilization, and the native manufactures have been started among them, and a lively trade is carried on between the republic and the U. S., Great Britain, Belgium, and Hamburg. Palm oil, sugar, cotton, coffee, ivory, camwood, arrowroot, etc., are exported, and rice, cotton, cotton-flower, and tobacco are imported. The country is divided into four counties—Mesurado, Grand Bassa, Sinou, and Maryland. The capital, Monrovia, is situated in Mesurado, and has about 3,400 inhabitants. Other settlements are New Georgia, Caldwell, Virginia, Edina, Greenville, and Buchanan. The revenue of the republic is about $100,000, almost exclusively derived from customs-house duties. A public debt of $500,000 was contracted in 1883. The form of government of the republic is modeled after that of the U. S. All men are born free. Elections take place by ballot, and every male citizen who possesses the right of suffrage. But no white man can be admitted to citizenship, and no white man can hold real estate in the republic (a temporary provision). The president is elected for two years; the senators for four. The legislative assembly consists of two senators to the legislative assembly, and one representative for every 10,000 inhabitants. The first president was Joseph Jenkins Roberts, who was elected in 1848 to 1856, and was once more elected in 1871. Hilary W. Johnson was elected president May, 1883. The official language of the republic is English.
