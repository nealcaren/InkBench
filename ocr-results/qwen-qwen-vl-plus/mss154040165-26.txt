Captain's instructions and some dunson craft paper describing the two varieties. She did not get any thing mysterious with Chin Cam. Destriels definitely stated they could not get the dunsercums at $3 per 100. Just why anyone in that office should not know crepe paper is a mystery. I do not think they might think the campaign consisted mostly of paper designs. The secret is that Rochester did not get its headquarters demand for May 2, and the Captain gathered for my Conference cannot take the dunsercums home with them. That is a long way from efficiency. Please see what is the matter and who doesn't know crepe paper. Scornd scarcely below her.
