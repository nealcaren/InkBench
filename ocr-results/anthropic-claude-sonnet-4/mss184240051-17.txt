Looking at this handwritten document, I can make out some text but much of it is difficult to read clearly due to the handwriting style and image quality. Here's what I can transcribe with confidence:

[Left side - appears to be vertical text, partially illegible]

[Right side, clearer text:]
three grave some —
& planned round, — &
The grave a great deal
& down please much
round. — the Mother
has well regards &
pretty much Stone &
love.

For My Mumm
Know this Daughter
His wife did evidently
not believe in the old
English law concerning
the "corrections" of a
husband.

[There appear to be two small printed text blocks or clippings on the right side of the page, but they are too small and blurry to transcribe accurately]

Note: Much of the handwritten text, particularly on the left side, is too unclear for me to transcribe with confidence. The handwriting appears to be in cursive script that would require specialized paleographic skills to read accurately.
