to read before our Feminist Society. No dear have been due
in all work, she in the L.O.T. and in popular evening courses.
But as there are no complete histories in Romanian and not
a single feminist library, it is impossible as even to know
the titles of the books, necessary for preparation. So I dare herefore
to you as to the other sections of I.A.R. to ask your help.
                Feeling so much the lips of a poor library of the W.L.
Very at one time with our sisters, to found one at B, and

women in a club; as, we are dreaming of since a long time.
Would you, among others to able for the purpose, a list of books.
Ask your sister and so send us one of the standard work
of women movement in your country and specially
notes, there we could find biographies of your famous woman.
We should spare in a first serie of lecture, on politics & and not
to commit Women and in a second deal the portrait of Carrie
and again Science. But We have, so little, it is easy out much
