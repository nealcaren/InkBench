Dear Friend
There is to be a Suffrage festival here
Nov 14 and 15th and we are to have a
Woman's Journal booth - Can you send
us any decorations and a large card
for Woman suffrage booths - and a
large about 50 subscription blanks -
I've never done anything of this sort and
have little idea how to go about it -
But Dr MacNaughton who is getting up the
festival telephoned this morning that
Alice Paul had sent her word she would
not pay the cost of creating a booth for the
Suffragist and if she Dr MacN sent that
the cost of creating the booth she would let
it be used for the Journal the paper she
preferred to help - & promised to see to it
