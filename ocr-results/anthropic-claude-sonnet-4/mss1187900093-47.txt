a lecture in Washington -
Then I said "I will write" and
this is my letter of inquiry -
Have you given up your
journey to Boothbay? Also if
cannot help being glad at the
idea a good many reasons why.
If I had'nt thought of more,
both as reason to us - If I could
have written as formerly, I should
not have so long postponed my
inquiries - But I am obliged
to curtail my letters both as to
number & length -
I hope that it will turn
out that you are to pass the
Winter in your pleasant and
comfortable home - Why I love
you bears the terrors of the
raging seas and many inconveniences
when you are so well arranged
in your quiet and delightful
home? Not for fame or gain these

are already yours - Both of you.
I was glad to see a notice
of your lecture and to know that
it was there to enjoy it - I'm
sure that you can make your
experience very interesting and
valuable - And then I like
Douglas too. I doubt not his
hands full of leisurely work
about which you can assist
him if you have not all that
you can do yourself -
I shall write to Mrs. Farnum
to-day and tell her all that
I know of your movements -
because I so much I am certain
that you cannot lecture in
Washington and be also on the road
to Boothbay - in Maine -
I want the progress to convey
great mental strain and so in-
dulge his warning years that he
may stay as long as possible with us.
