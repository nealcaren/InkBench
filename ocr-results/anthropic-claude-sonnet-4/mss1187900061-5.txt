Washington D.C.
July 13th 1883.

Dear Grandpa,
                    I received
your affectionate letter on the
12th inst and we were very glad
to hear from you, and to know
that you are getting along
nicely.
Everything is passing along
smoothly here, excepting the
weather which is at times almost intolerable. It is now
about nine o'clock and the
thermometer stands about 84 1/2Â°.
Charlie has not left us yet
for Lily, Carlena, Vespers, and
I don't expect he will or
not; I think he latter as
I don't hear him say any-
