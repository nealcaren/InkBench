after stabling their horses returned to their Cabins and in-
creased the Light. But the exertions of the federal troops
became weaker, human nature could endure no more,
A decisive strategy seemed about to crown the efforts of
the rebels, at this critical moment a cavalry suddenly ap-
peared, Genl Mc Clellan, expelled to the federal combat
to open fire on the enemy, even their ponderous shells
burst amongst them, whole ranks were battered to the
earth, confusion prevailed, physical through their columns,
and they who a few moments before, were confident of
victory, were themselves compelled to give way.

the day, by making a desperate charge, The confederate
were ordered to cease firing. This veteran fallowed
from column to column and cheered his men to the
attack. The enemy met them with firmness, but heat
gradually to give way. Their lines soon broke, and
everything [?] fled from the field in confusion. The
rebel prisoners, captured a large number of Cannon, four,
portions of the batteries of Randord, Mills, April. The
goal of the Campayn was reached on both by, and
the Soldiers of the Union, earned the honor of the
nation with the blood of its Patriots.
