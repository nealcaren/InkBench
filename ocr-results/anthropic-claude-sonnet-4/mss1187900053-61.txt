Dear Mr Douglas
It is a very long
time since we have written to
you or heard from you, and
I think it now in hopes of pro-
voking a reply. We really are
very much in the dark about
you, & do not even know whether
you still hold office under the
Government, or well have not heard
of the contrary I conclude that you
do - & therefore that you have not
been disturbing & holding meetings
over the Country from that wonderful
as of old. I hope that your health
is good - & that you can report
well of yourself & of your family.
