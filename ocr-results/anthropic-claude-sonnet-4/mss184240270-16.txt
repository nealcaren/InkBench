Looking at this handwritten document, I can make out portions of the text, but much of it is quite difficult to read due to the handwriting style and image quality. Here's what I can transcribe with reasonable confidence:

[The left side contains heavily crossed-out or overwritten text that is largely illegible]

On the right side, I can make out fragments including:

funny I do not think
he often done. If he
[?] it is no [?]
he as a any pretty
green [?] a pretty
[?] disposition but

explained the day "close
old door" for [?] they

[?] done I have, [?]

the "old [?] [?]
[?] it be [?] [?]
[?] [?] to you [?]
[?] o [?] only

[Note: Much of this handwritten text is extremely difficult to read with certainty. The writing appears to be in cursive script and contains many words that are unclear or partially obscured. I've indicated uncertain readings with [?] where the text is illegible or unclear.]
