I came to Boston on Mon. &
made a short visit before winter, &
I am still here, now waiting for winter
to be gone. I have lived very quietly, only
been to the opera a few times. I have
seen none of the celebrities, they were
too costly. My heart is not broken, does
not break easily. I thought I should
see you here this spring, because the Papers
said so. It has been a trying winter,
but Spring & violets are near the cure.
Effie writes me often, & is happy if
her bit of house-work suits old itself.
But if she is shut in, she sew holes
in door studies. What she feels, the Hands
Chafes. She has a good-practical man, &
keep her from doing un-heart of things. Spirit
easy. You bless you dear - always.

Lovingly - Mamie Day-
