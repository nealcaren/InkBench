My Dear Mr. Dvorak:

I leave for the East on

tomorrow morning & how I have found office

busy my calling on you & Mrs. Dvorak that

I shall be unable to do so. Do make my

excuses to your joint wife for me. I remember

her with so much pleasure in Bohemia. I hope

to see them to Chicago later in the summer.

Then I will not fail to see you both. Is

Very Cordially
