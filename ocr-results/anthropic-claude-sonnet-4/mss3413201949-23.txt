(1) The Senseless Waste of War

When the great war began 37 millions of gold was debt
owed when the British Empire. The total coin, money
& bullion in circulation & in the whole world was agfit
eleven billions & half, out of that all the existing plans of
all banks cut the war, borrowing all they could
printing paper money until this [?] & result the
cost of the east & international debt & you see
complicated & burdensome that a universal panic
followed. Must countries waste! I expressed it they
can not pay their debts to us?

So you know that every man killed in this late
War cost the living $175000!

Let me read you a little column we extract from
a magazine between a king & his prime minister.
In the 3rd century before christ. Caesar - By the
Beard of Jupiter & all the Gods! Sireâ€”

2 Wars are the gamble of North
When the game stops, that has not yet happened.
War ceases to not then though it the glorified law,
but know the facts & refuse to protect such an
history - mind women & silence the glamour &
war trappings, war music, war cloths as the
false intelligent about including.
