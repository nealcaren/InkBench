My dear Marjie:-
                I gave you this place for a 
cable and now is here. We remain
another day but I suspect that progress
is in the direction of recovery and that you
for not cabled at all.
    Mar 27 - I was interrupted here and now here
at things are different and time has passed.
Your cable has been received, and it was great
relief to get it. I imagine you passing through
that discouraging stage when you think you
never will be well again and when life has
lost all its fervor. But keep up your courage
and you'll pull through. I am so glad
you are better. This world would be a
black and place without you dear Mollie.
    I expected to mail you a note here
because I thought it would be a good
cable port. It would be a good mail
station, but it seems many American
