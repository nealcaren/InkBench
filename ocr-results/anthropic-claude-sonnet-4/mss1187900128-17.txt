I know not where to find pastors
for them; I appeal to your judgment.
I have ever been friendly to the
Colonized race, having lived many
years at Eagle Station on the
Island of Hayti, where our husband
was a permanent commercial House,
under the name of Arlims Laroche
& Co. We are well known to the present
President of Hayti, as for years he
was interested in the purchase of
Coffee for the House of Arlims Laroche
& Co. Our Wilson was also Consul
for the United States, and the
Recognition of Hayti was effected
by him. From which final this Record
in the State Department.
Be so kind as to write for us do
influenced public opinion in the
favor of the Colored people.
Hoping you to excuse me for
addressing you I remain
Very Respectfully
Frances L. Wilson
