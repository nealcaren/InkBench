feel that I am growing old,
am not now what I have
been - although thee need
been quite generous with or
me - You will see by
this letter that it is harder
for me to write now then
in old times when my
nervousness was steady
and strong - have they
kind regards to your
Wife and which my good truths
hardly foins - accept this
hastily written note and
believe me as ever your
friend and wellwisher
James H. Duffin

Ruth says come and see
us - I say Amen. You have
now an engagement not
