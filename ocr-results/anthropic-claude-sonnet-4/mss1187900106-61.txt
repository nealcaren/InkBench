JOHNSON'S UNIV. CYC. VOL. III

Libe'ria, a republic on the western coast of Africa, founded in 1820 by the American Colonization Society (see COLONIZATION SOC.), and established as an independent state in 1847. The territory of this republic stretches along the Atlantic from the Sherbero River on the N. W., to the Pedro River on the S. E., a distance of about 300 miles, extending inland from the coast from 10 to 40 miles. Its area, which is steadily increased by purchases from the natives, is estimated at not more than 25,000 miles. The shore is elevated and rocky in the S. E., but otherwise low, generally sandy or gravelly, seldom marshy, and generally cultivated or covered with dense forests or hills and lofty mountain ranges traversed by fine valleys. Many streams flow to the ocean, but none of them is navigable for more than 20 miles from the mouth; the most important are the St. Paul, navigable for 18 miles, the St. John for 15 miles, the Junk for 6 miles from the mouth; the St. John, the Junk, and the Cape Mount River. The climate is thoroughly tropical. Of the two seasons, the dry lasts from October to June, and the wet from June to October. In the dry season the average heat is 84° F., in the wet season 78°. Throughout the year, except in the wet season the average heat is 76°, the thermometer never falling below 60°. To the white man the climate is generally very unhealthful, and deaths are probably from miasmatic; and even the negro, when born and reared in another climate, suffers on his arrival here with what is called African fever. The natives, on the contrary, are robust, healthy, and long-lived. The soil is generally very fertile, particularly that in the valleys and along the courses of the St. Paul. Here the sugar-cane grows luxuriantly; one year's produce was estimated at 300,000 pounds. Coffee grows wild, and sugar yield two crops annually. Coffee of excellent quality is cultivated with success in the interior. The sweet potato, cassava, plantain, and among the vegetables, cabbages, peas, beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.; and the fruits, lemons, oranges, guavas, tamarinds, pine-apples, figs, grapes, bananas, melons, etc., are easily raised. The forests contain teak, mahogany, rosewood, hickory, poplar, several kinds of gum trees, dye-woods, camphor shrubs, and different varieties of useful palms, among which is the nut-bearing palm, from which palm oil is made. Wild animals, such as elephants, leopards, antelopes, crocodiles, etc., are now nearly exterminated. Of minerals, iron abounds, and copper is said to occur in the interior. The population is about 15,000, republic numbered, according to the largest estimate, about 1,068,000, of whom about 15,000 are American-Liberians, and the remainder natives belonging to different tribes: the Veys, mostly Mohammedans, among whom the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U. S. maintains a mission; the Bassas, the Kru-men, almost entirely pagans; the Bassas, among whom the American Baptist missionaries established a mission in 1833; the Grebos, mostly idolaters; the Mandingos, the most gifted of the tribes under the jurisdiction of the republic; and others. Most of the American emigrants are progressing in all branches of civilization. Industrial processes and manufactures have been started in many places. Commerce has sprung up between the republic and the U. S., Great Britain, Belgium, and Hamburg. Palm oil, sugar, cotton, rice, coffee, arrow-root, arrowroot, etc. are exported; cotton goods, cutlery, powder, and tobacco are imported. The country is divided into three counties—Montserado, Grand Bassa, and Maryland. The capital, Monrovia, is situated on Cape Mesurado, and has about 3,400 inhabitants. Other settlements are Millsburg, Bexley, Caldwell, Virginia, Edina, Greenville, Lexington, Buchanan, Millsburg, etc. The annual revenue is about $1,500,000, and the expenditure about the same for house duties. A public debt of $500,000 was contracted in 1871. The constitution of the republic is modeled after that of the U. S., with suffrage free and equal. Elections take place by ballot, and every male citizen who possesses real estate has the right of suffrage. No one, however, can be admitted to citizenship, and none but citizens can hold real estate in the republic (a temporary provision). The legislature consists of a senate and house of representatives; the senators are elected for four; the representatives for two. Each county sends two senators to the legislative assembly, and one representative for every 10,000 inhabitants. The first president was Joseph J. Roberts, who served four terms, from 1848 to 1856, and was re-elected in 1872. In 1868 E. J. Roye was elected president May, 1883. The official language is the English.
