Rochester, N.Y., Aug 17, 1877-

Friend Douglas.
        I started from Rochester yesterday
morning to String a wire to Honeoye Lake.
Tonight at 6 o'clock I was in the Swamp
a few [miles] north of the Rush Reservoir.
I attached a soaker instrument upon the
wire and communicated with the person
who took my place during my absence.
He telegraphed me the substance of your
postal card. Before I left home I rec'd
your telegram, & went to the Rock. Sav. Bk
where the Def was procured and notified
them of its new reception, and of your wish
for a duplicate. They said that they
could not give another until they had
received their rep from the Clearing house
at NY, which would be the first week
