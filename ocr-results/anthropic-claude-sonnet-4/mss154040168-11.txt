nth enthusiasm. May how thou much
appreciated - more than you can know.
Sam longing to hear what is going to
Rome, how and when. Sam as ignorant
as a mild buckeye and Sam beginning
to worry lost the mail & need reach
Panama after I have gone for how
hear - the best correspondent for your
letters are always there when I arrive.
I learn that mail is not carried up
this boat to N. Y. but put off at Key
West and goes up by rail so you will
get this soon. It is not for Panama.
Please accept my collective letter
as one for you. I must go to dress now.
Dont let to Mollie She rill deliver it to
the giver. Lovingly indeed!
