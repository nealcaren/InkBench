My dear Ready;
I haven't thank you for two letters and the notes and clippings concerning Mrs Blinn. I thank you especially for the clippings for as you suspect, I am interested in her outgoing. Last year, in Buffalo, at the National Convention, I think Mrs Sweet brought a letter she had received from Effie Vance, and she had described very vividly how Mrs Blinn had been able to rise above her suffering thro Christian Science. Doubtless tears flowed as she read it, and she was no great admirer of Mrs B. I believe she told me that E Vance was also getting interested in Ch Sci Mrs B. was one of the most generous and forgiving natures I ever met, and altho she also had her weaknesses of character, as one no doubt has, she was a woman to be admired for very many estimable qualities.
