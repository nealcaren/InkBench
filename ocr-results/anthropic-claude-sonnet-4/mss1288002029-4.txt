"The Governor knows right," said Mrs. Howe. "His mothers that make both boys any and friends of the prohibition necessitated that Mrs. Howe tells me, may very well have sufficient effect.

"Do you agree with the Governor in his implication that woman suffrage may prove to be a useless privilege?"

"The point that I should make," replied Mrs. Howe, "is, who has the right to determine whether it will prove to be useless? I say to the male portion of the community that they never have had, and never will have, experience that entitles them to make the decision. There are at the most well the male and female suffrage that it is suffered to be. I maintain that since the allowed without the suffrage. Suffrage does more than good; it gives one class the privilege of trying to lift or to cast down another class. To cast them that the obligation to give it involves the right to take it away, you will not feel very wise about this, and the fortunate experience."

"How do you view the Governor's proposal to refer the entire suffrage question for or against by the women themselves?"

"Well it's just sufficient matter to wreck of discussion if we would do exactly think that's very great of which under woman suffrage. I would recommend to the chance of a separate vote.

If he thinks the cause is in you think, of such a nature?

"But now will see that, if we do settle the matter in that manner, and it turns out to our favor, we can do nothing more than we can do separately by the suffrage now; but if it goes the other way, then the matter stands against us permanently, simply because, first, it implies that woman has a voice, and therefore it seems is sound to do us of right, a terrible thing."

TO THE CHARGE OF A POPULAR VOTE.

"Does that the proposed of this house suffrage matter amount to a practical way to the life.

"I should feel very uncertain about that. People will use this time, and I certainly ought to get against it. If I say I am in favor of being popular prejudice, I can make a great many people uncomfortable and accept the information; if I say I am against it, they will accept the other. Who would fear by the person who a prejudice, brothers or sisters, and any vote would be a prejudice, and not really information. I am not in favor of a prejudice, and all personal or proper information.

"What was the Governor's idea of possible voting?

"I would answer that voting for school suffrage means that public voting places thence good during elections are probably of. We could vote for a time during elections or two together, or two thirds and part his service for what these great possibility of teaching as many as we would to teaching particularly in the immediate future."

"I doubt entirely for municipal suffrage as. We cannot always convince the voter in which things are to be better off. We could tell what that persons to us, and the chance would never advance in every advantage over all matter.

"Must then what we be optional."

"I did not say we must be optional.

"But that is in and of voting is concerned; it immediately but given by reasons of this study of the community sense. This study distinctly states we want to know what people feel about it. My carrying in mind of what individuals may like to think."
