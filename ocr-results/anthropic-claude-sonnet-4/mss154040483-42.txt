ture was started in the Northwest an attempt has been made to start a similar cooperative delivery system in Cleveland, Ohio. Numerous other attempts are being made to solve the problem of distributors' spread. In Cincinnati, for example, the farmers have formed a cooperative association and are building a large plant of their own to deliver milk to the housewife's door. In other communities farmers are also working out short cuts to the consumer.

"Licensing"
(Continued from page 17)
Third Assembly be promptly taken, the date for the regular meeting of the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Women and Children was advanced by several weeks. And it was to this meeting that our American representative, Miss Grace Abbott of the Children's Bureau, went as "unofficial observer."

The full report of the action of that Committee has just now been given out. This informs us that the fullest possible consideration was given to the draft convention which, after much discussion, was finally adopted. In this discussion two other important points were raised and were finally crystallized into resolutions. One was a recommendation for a questionnaire to be sent to all states of the American Union and other states that have a system of regulation for a report on its working and results, and those that have abolished it for a full statement of the reasons that led them to do so. The other urges the use of women police in dealing with prostitution.

But, says the report, particular importance attaches to that resolution which embodies the proposal made by the "unofficial observer" from the United States. This was that the Committee should, without delay, appoint experts to make, in collaboration with the governments of the countries concerned, a comprehensive study of the conditions under which this traffic goes on, the methods practiced and the main centers between which it prevails. Again, it is seen, the mighty weapon of publicity is to be used. Light is to be turned upon this darkest spot in our social life. It is hardly credible that, when the full facts are laid out for the world's judgment, men everywhere and people will not be stirred to some immediate positive action against this hideous business.

When these resolutions of the Advisory Committee have passed through the necessary technical steps, they will be referred to the various national legislatures for ratification. Adequate legislation for their enforcement must then be passed. And when that is done, as Mrs. Dale, alternate from Australia, said at the time of the discussion in the Third Assembly, the greatest blow ever dealt at the traffic will have been struck.

Your Investments
By ELEANOR KERR

TWO policies issued by insurance companies which are very popular and which are more or less on the endowment order mentioned in our last article, are income bonds and retirement annuities.

Many women and men, too, of middle age like to be independent on them and wish to provide themselves with savings from which to draw income in the future, find the purchase of income bonds one of the safest methods of assuring this. The purchaser makes annual payments until a certain age, after which date the insurance company pays her a fixed amount monthly for the rest of her life. Should she die before reaching this age, the insurance company usually agrees to return to the heirs the total amount of deposits which have been made. And even if the purchaser dies after having reached the stipulated age and received some of the income payments, but not the aggregate equal to the entire amount deposited as premiums, the difference is usually returned to the heirs.

The cost of income bonds varies greatly, according to the age at which payment to the woman is desired. A person thirty years of age, who wishes to receive ten dollars a month for life, beginning at the age of sixty, would pay an annual premium of about $534.14, and the same amount for each additional ten dollars of income desired. Should she wish the income to begin at the age of fifty the annual premium would be about $382.36. Disregarding the fact that no interest is paid until the end of twenty or thirty years, the interest received after that period amounts to a little over 7 per cent. on the accumulated deposits in the latter case, and approximately 11Â½ per cent. in the former case. The profit to the insurance company, of course, lies in the fact that interest on the money accumulating during the twenty or thirty year periods is not paid out, but goes into the company's treasury. From a business man's point of view, this makes the interest received on the money, after the twenty or thirty year period of waiting for it, represent only about one half the actual rate indicated about, if the money could have been invested where it would have had a chance to increase 50 per cent in 10 per cent. The compensation for that lower turn lies in protection against making a bad investment and in the guarantee of systematic saving.

The retirement annuity bond operates on the same principle and is practically the same thing, though differently named. The premium unit for women is $105 a year. This would provide for a woman thirty a retirement annuity of $13.50 a month for life beginning at the age of fifty, and of $30.71 a
