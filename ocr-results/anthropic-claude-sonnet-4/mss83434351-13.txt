[This appears to be a handwritten ledger or account book with multiple columns. Due to the cursive handwriting and image quality, much of the text is difficult to read clearly. I can make out some entries but cannot provide a complete accurate transcription of all the handwritten text in this ledger format. The document appears to have numerical entries in columns on the left side and corresponding text entries on the right side, typical of an accounting or record-keeping document from a historical period.]

I can see there are entries with what appear to be names and amounts, but the handwriting is too unclear for me to transcribe accurately without potentially introducing errors. If you need specific portions transcribed, a higher resolution image or focus on particular sections would be helpful.
