I think that we quite un-
usual for a seventeen year
old boy. So if you could send
it to thee, some day, I would
be very happy indeed.
Please remember me to Miss
Wilson & Miss Peck and be
sure to let me know if they
or you come to Washington.
With affectionate greetings
                Gratefully yours,
                Florence H. Darby
