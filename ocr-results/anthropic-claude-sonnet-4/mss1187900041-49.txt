Dear Father,
Your reply to my letter was
received yesterday.
From what you said in your letter to
Lewis I feared that you supposed I was
discharged for neglect of duty, or some other
such cause; but such was not the case.
Gen Howard did not know at first that
I was among the number, and he inte-
mated to me afterwards that had I
been a member of the Law Class I could
have been retained. The following is the
truth:
Gen Langston has taken charge of the
Law Department of the Howard University
and has about twenty colored students
