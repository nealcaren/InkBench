London Sunday May 6, 94
Dear Mr Douglas:
    Your letter directed to Man-
chester, has followed me all round
till I reached ye here. I much re-
gret glad to get it. Then I wrote to you
I had not seen your letter to thy
Chief; since seeing it I know
from what he and others said,
that while they did not expect
"much" (may they say you the same
compliment?) I do think knowing you
to be incapable of such a thing,
still they would have I do
better satisfied if you had
spoken more positively respecting
me and my work. Mr Whitmore
says since the Society has failed
so miserably and I was thus left
to vouch for myself, you would
not hesitate to vouch for me.
We cannot go into the country
telling people about this plan
at all and why I am un-
accompanied by the persons
who brought me over. As this
dear [?] down member of the (6/3
race, a positive letter or voucher
