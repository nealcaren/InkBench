My Dear Mrs. Catt:
    Give me
the General Hospital, Osteopathic
Unit #750 - at Los Angeles, at the
present with a fractured leg
I have been here 2 weeks today.
Hope soon to be released from
this terrible home of torture, a
cart, so that I can return
to my little apartment at
609 Fairview Ave., So. Pasadena
Calif.  Many friends, wonderful
to me in every way.
    Address my close
friend Mrs. Lois Fairfield, 1918

all care of me in charge.
                Cordially
