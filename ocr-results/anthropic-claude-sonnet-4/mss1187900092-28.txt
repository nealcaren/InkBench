Dear Grandpa:-
                I have learned with
much surprise that you are still
in the city & Washington so many
on extended leave of absence from
your work & duty, I am very glad
that such a leave has been granted
you, as I know that you are far
happier in Cedar Hill than any
place you can go and only wish
that matters could be so arranged
as to allow you to remain in this
