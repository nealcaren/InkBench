3. Never write 'Grace -
Warwick Hill.
4th July -

My dear friend
I have much
a waste yesterday
in sending what must
be to you an unsatisfactory
note - but I must do
the bidding of the
members of some of our
societies & tell you that
the interests of your
race & our interesting
papers would be ruined,
if the papers are not
