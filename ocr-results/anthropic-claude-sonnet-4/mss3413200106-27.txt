Dear Mrs. Blackwell, â€”

I am blessed with a
propensity to be always at something. You
are something; still you will not draw
an illogical conclusion, as three successive
gentle might tempt a less reasonable
creature to do.

The truth is, its hot; hot beyond
creed, to say nothing of deed. What resource else
was left but you?

The other evening, 20 or so were
spoken of to me as having done this and that
or more in the war. I was called on to advise
her. I had to say, yes, I admire what she did.
But must she not be a noble woman to do
so much. Then I said "its my will for us,
you and she & me, to do some good." Is the
only recommendation ever I can have, Bob really.
I think do see one who need never need to
recommend him; seeing whine one thinks
not how much he has done or can do, but how
much he is.

I fancied I was talking Greek,
& went no further; but you who understand
Greek, is this really so unintelligible?
