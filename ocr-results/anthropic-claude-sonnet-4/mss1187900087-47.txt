that after a battle of two hours they (the
Northern forces) were repulsed, leaving
many dead and wounded, and that order
and tranquillity reigned in the South.
We shall have on the 19th a mail of the
19th from Port au Prince via Nassau, a cable on
20th via Cuba and a mail again on the 25th
middy. - I continue to believe that the
Northern forces will raise the seige and
retreat to the North, proclaiming perhaps
secession, and that the unfortunate state
of things will continue yet for months.
If the Government of Cleveland and Harri-
son had acted in good faith in their rela-
tions with Hayti, this war would not have
lasted. - I ask myself if it would not
be well for one to go to Port au Prince with
Mr. Douglass to see if the two parties contend-
ing cannot arrive at an honorable understanding.
Now, my dear Douglass, this letter is already so
long that I must cut it short or it be bore.
Very sincerely and very cordially yours,
Mrs. Bassett and Jetty                     E S Bassett
will write to Mrs Douglass
