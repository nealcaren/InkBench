Dear Friend Douglas

When we first saw your
appointment to Hayti - and also how
many kind and beautiful things
the newspapers were saying about you
I began to clip and stick them with
the intention of sending them all on
to you -) but "lots" of them; but alas!
in the hurge piles of Editorial scraps
they have all disappeared - but these
I enclose.

It was pleasant to see the
appreciation in which you are held,
while you are alive to see it.
I am not sure that we are good
& keep you so - We need you
here.
