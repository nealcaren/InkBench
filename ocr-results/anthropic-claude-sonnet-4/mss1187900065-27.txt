THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
FOR THE
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Headquarters, Fourth Avenue cor. 22nd Street.

New York January 26 1885

To - The Probate Judge of Hudson County, N.J.
Sir I inclose herewith the Last Will
and Testament of Miss Ottilia Aesing, who died,
as I am informed, in the City of Paris, France, August
21st 1884. I have decided not to offer the same for
probate, because I do not propose to qualify as Executor,
but in view of the fact & other persons having interests
in the estate, under the Will in question, I deem it my
duty to file the latter, in order that there may be no
obstacle to your entertaining an Application for ad-
ministration on the estate, with the Will annexed.
Please to state, however, that it is the intention of
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
on the Reserve of the Trusts mentioned in the Will,
to claim the property to which it is entitled.
I have the honor to remain,
with great Respect

Henry Bergh
President.
