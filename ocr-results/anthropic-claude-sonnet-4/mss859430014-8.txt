My Dear daughter, I hope
you are still getting along
alright. we are well, Brooks
is still on the job. and
keeping the house to summer
time heat, despite the nice
bright weather we are having.
    Brother and part of the
family was here last night.
they brought Mrs Cotton over
to church and waited here while
she was in service.
    Darey was not feeling
well. she had been to the Doctor
early in during the day, He gave
her a shot. and she said it
left her feeling dizzy and sleepy.
she did not look well at all. so
I called to-day. said she was feel-
ing better.
    I am sending a letter
that came to-day from High-
lander. and one that came
last week. so from to-day on
I will forward them direct.
write when you can.
    much love from us
to you.        from mother
                Lona.
