An undaunted devotion to the cause of woman suffrage links the name of Alice Stone Blackwell, counselor of the Boston League of Women Voters, with that of her famous mother, Lucy Stone, Pioneer of Woman's Rights. Her father, Henry B. Blackwell, was an abolitionist and practically the only man who really devoted his whole time to obtaining equal rights for women. One of Miss Blackwell's aunts, Elizabeth Blackwell, was the first woman to take a medical degree, and another, Antoinetta Brown Blackwell, was the first woman to be ordained a minister. Miss Blackwell was graduated from Boston University in 1881, and then joined her parents in working for suffrage and in publishing the Woman's Journal, carrying it on alone after their death until 1917 when it became the Woman Citizen. For many years she has pinned almost single-handed before the committee of the Massachusetts Legislature to answer the various anti-suffrage arguments, and it distinguished this able lawyer when he said he considered her rebuttals the ablest presented on any controversial matter he had ever heard. It was also Miss Blackwell who brought together the two parties of the suffrage movement, whose estrangement had weakened their effectiveness, welding them in 1890 into the National American Woman's Suffrage Association, of which she was secretary for nearly 20 years. For years she has been a trustee of Boston University and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Close to her heart is the cause of the Armenians. She has rendered into English a volume of Armenian poems, as well as one of Russian poems a volume of Yiddish verse, and one, still unpublished, of Mexican and South American poetry. Her biography of Catherine Breshkovsky, "The Little Grandmother of the Russian Revolution," was at one time one of the "six best sellers."
