Dear Mr Chapman Catt

I just published the request book
on the Great work you have
accomplished during your
wonderfully active life.
This book is a grand inspiration
for all of us in every country
I was deeply moved by the pages
on your international work and
the meetings in Geneva, few of
which I was fortunate enough
