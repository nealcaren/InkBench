my dear daughter,- miss
mack came yesterday
and brought the box and
visited with me awhile.
she said she had a nice
trip up and working at
home and cleaning away
weeds in the back and
the like.

we were very glad
to talk with you Sunday-
night. It helps Parks, feel
better. we are doing very
well at present. Brother
and family are quite
well. he doesn't come so
often now. is still work-
ing out at Jackson. and
they are getting welfare
help. I hope you are well
and won't over work be-
fore you comes home.
now that School is out I
suppose some of the Child-
ren will be over to stay.
much love from mother
