dear Sir
         I have thought of an expedient to bring
in Caroline which I submit to you. It is the Genl
Mosley is mustering his force to leave for Rappahannock.
Now let your bold despern mitt clears & the bone all
& let her go & stay his negro & get it out what he has bought
there or would I am sure there is one & let her be our
that it is an arrangement of more over which you have
no control. What do you think of it? Let me have

                                        Yr truly,
                                        John H. Lewis
