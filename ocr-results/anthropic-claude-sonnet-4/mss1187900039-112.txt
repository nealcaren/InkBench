Dear Father
     Yours of the 4th instant is just received.
I saw an account of one of your babies in New
Jersey published in the N.York Tribune, and I thought
that you might have other appointments, not hearing
from you. All are well except the baby, he has a severe
cold. Margarete is attending him, we are afraid he
will have the croup, but hope not. I dont wish to trouble
your mind about the affair between Nathan, Fred, and my
self I know your mind, and how it is likely occupied. You
may know the cause of the difficulty, but I know you dont
know the whole truth, and it is hard to find it out under
the circumstances. I am afraid that New York has gone
against us, blood for another war. If you will be at home
any length of time I will write again soon, as I am
very busy just now. Settle would send love if she knew
I was writing. Love to Mother and all.

Your Aff Son
Chas H. Douglass
