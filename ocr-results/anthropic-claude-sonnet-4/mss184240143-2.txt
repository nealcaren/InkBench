My dear Prof Dre Skinner
I am afraid your business affairs are again suffering. I'm having with the party cancelled to camp much weight. Will, 6 years as smallpox & "Can't Keep a Hotel" is an error, I think there is something mysterious next Johns McMullen & I might have been well in a different position.
You told me you would see me about your theatrical business & the rest I know you have in Prof (as it were) of pulling best your affair & "Keeping those children up" I thought you had a clear experience before with "Russian Manager" & had learned by experience the excess of management. Don't think I am scolding you only that I feel slighted - I came in town & you & things are new in this business - or out of it for that. Nettleton & unwel (or will) have done it cheerfully
