Looking at this image, I can see it's a page from what appears to be a cemetery or burial record book. The page shows a tabular format with multiple columns containing names, dates, and other information. However, due to the image quality and the small text size, I cannot make out the specific details clearly enough to provide an accurate transcription of the individual entries.

The page appears to be titled at the bottom "BEAUFORT NATIONAL CEMETERY, SOUTH CAROLINA" and shows what looks like burial records with columns for information like names, dates, military units, and other details typical of cemetery records.

Without being able to read the specific text clearly, I should mark this as having text that is largely illegible rather than attempt to guess at the entries, as that would not follow the transcription guidelines of only transcribing what can be clearly seen.

[?] - The text in this cemetery record table is too small and unclear in this image to transcribe accurately.
