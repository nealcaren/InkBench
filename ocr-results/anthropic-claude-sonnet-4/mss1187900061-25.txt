Honorable
Wm H. Douglas
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Douglas:
I need our
special delivered and to occasion
commemorative of Emancipation in the District of Columbia
and I was particularly edified
and pleased by your utterances,
and surprised at the vigor &
brilliancy of your powers after
an almost constant exercise
of them for nearly a half century in the cause of our oppressed people.
