succeed with a took when the author would be)
has neither sense nor pep and no vocabulary
to express the feeling with the 15 ay, it will be most
welcome until I have read it I shall not know
whether to return it or to keep it with thanks or
without thanks may! I am sending you
a bumf box of left over red do. this is no gift just
a load there left I haven't the smallest idea
what any of there are, but me will find out
If you mix nearly I should warn given you
a garden-full of plants from the greentorei
all of which will either die in my garden or
grow wicked little blossoms that remind me
them it always wonders in yours! When you
come down I shall take you twice a garden
that is worth looking at.
