Editor Woman's Journal,
Dear Madam,
Enclosed you will
find $2.50, which I send to
pay for the Woman's Journal, to
be sent to my address, for one
year. I have hitherto received
the paper through a friend, but
I think I will have one of my
own now, so that I can have
some to give away.
I received your letter last
Monday, and I wish to thank
you for your evidently careful
perusal of my manuscript, and
for your friendly criticism of
my work. I feel more encour-
aged by your commendations
