Grandpa was never called "Lloyd."
He was first Frederick Bailey. His slave
Claimant told him when he ran
away; and because the marine
whose house he lived in New Bedford
Mass. was named Johnson, this man
who had just finished reading
"The Lady of the Lake" admired
so much the character in the
book named "Douglas" asked
grandpa - to keep from conflicting
their two Johnson names, he what
would like to call himself.
Douglass instead of Johnson!
Grandpa told him one name to him
was as good as another - and hence-
forth set out - to be called
Frederick Douglass.

This is facts - not hearsay.

Later - just recd. letter from Fred. he
leaves on his "debating tour" to day -
and really debates at Harvard. he
will stop with Eva. I've already written
Jos Riley & Nannie and sent Eva word.
