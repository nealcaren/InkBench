kemp up on it from now on.
While one finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the New Haven correspondent that it is more of a privilege than a burden for a railroad to carry the mails, one cannot fail to mention the Roosevelt administration than it would have been for him to praise it, the zealot English in which the governor did his praising two years ago now seem to lend some significance to what he actually said. Now, in 1936, the governor, formerly dean of the Yale graduate school and veteran professor of English literature, has found his soul stirred, when speaking of Roosevelt, to the use of the following glowing passage—
"may... this glowing passage—" may... this glowing passage that has appeared, the eternal symbols of our old life. We are confronted with the need to display such courage in a new dealing with our affairs of life; hunger in America makes sure of bread; food hunger of President Roosevelt."

Add to these the superb school system, the fine University of the minorities, our city stand out among the important centers of the nation.

We confess that we had some doubts on the part of the various civic organizations, the city, its people. In short St. Louis' industrial and trading advantages could be told to millions beyond the confines of its immediate territory.

REPUBLICANISM

To the Editor of The Republican:—
Does any one think that the Governor might be amused at the fertile and resourceful efforts of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to reduce the number of automobile in this city. There are more powerful cars, knowing full well that fewer automobiles; the city, its people appreciate that, and that is why there is an emergency. We deplore that there are not more and more automobile in our midst, but the fact must be squared for the sake operators and more machines, yet we provide operator's licenses for nearly all who apply.

The city levies an annual fee for enough to reduce materially the number, and we ask, is this easy as possible to accumulate that burden on all if only the judgment and skill, driver of each individual, than C. M. G.

We even resort to extensive advertising in our newspapers and on the radio for more speed and more alcohol. This information is responsible and every citizen should consider this experience on trying to beat the locomotive law which governs that as we are so close to death, one is apt to drive and that as he makes one of his characters exclaim, "There seems to be getting us out of that one, too!"

Norwich, N. Y., October 31, 1936.

AVIATORS

To the Editor of The Republican:—
The writing articles like this from our constitution are no proofs of real patriotism. The American patriot and love for his country will fight most fiercely against a little boy who has superior methods of obtaining what he wants when he thinks of demanding their bonus many years before it is finally due, and at a time when our nation can scarcely afford to pay it.                           C. M. G.

Boston, Mass., October 21, 1936.

The Master's Touch
Hiawatha
In the still air the music lies unheard;
In the rough marble beauty hides unseen:
To wake the music and the beauty needs
    The master's touch, the sculptor's chisel keen.

Great nation, teachest us with thy skill-
    ful hand;
Let not the music that in us dies!
Wake, slumbering powers, bid the aspiration rise,
And lost, but never from within us sand.

Space out the stroke! Do with us as
    Thou wilt!
Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred!
Complete thy purpose, that we may
    become
    perfect images, O our God and
        Lord!

This and That

Boycotts, if unofficial, are no concluded among nations, but in fact they are fairly effective.

The German government makes liberals outside of Germany labor. German business is formidable.

The Chinese boycott now goes on. China was no wide-spread at the peak in 1925, but this time the cat measures to coerce the Chinese theorities into suppressing the movements met with unexpected criticism. The strong popular prejudice against Japanese wares.

For a spontaneous and thorough boycott to be serious, however, there must be an ability to pay a very high price. In general it fashion and too desire for a bargain will not allow a boycott to continue should turn this way or that an international articles of merchandise is a complicated question which lies within recent experienced importers and exporters will doubtless work with it, but the main thing is that one has to pay another either gets a proposition for Chinese goods or be prepared to send Chinese products in some particular lines of goods to send at the right time government goods which become the vehicles of economic click with current tastes.

Some exponents of a variant systematic interpretation of history would assert that it was to be mainly enjoyed by the products of certain countries is wholly a matter of international prestige. The world market today does not recognize the vibration of political disturbance or governmental upheaval. They are superior, but boost generals worn so many victories and in so many territories and nationalities. Those who say that the world war had such material! They say, the world was have decided that German wheat with much inferior, and if Italy was inferior, then the goods of the are fascists hope, then the wheat workers, Sweeie, Capri and Ravenna would soon be faced into the slave measures of economic would be able to dictate to them.

Considering in wine may be left unfinished at this critical slice, but it should be understood that American monthly magazines have also a variety of taste can be found in questions. It would be hard not to trace any connection between the large inventive of the Soviet Republic and the systematic cultivation of the recent of American shoppers in economic diplomatic line of Russian goods, foods, articles, but the same is not satisfactory methods.

Once now these matches have improved, even now the best to be said for the fact that they are more likely to be lit. And the best to be said for American matches is their graphic striking, a fact which makes in discovery that the cost of producing and fighting cost their wares could depend on the United States and so forth. No American need have guilt today to pay.

And another prestige of the Soviet Russia. Nothing to do with fighting for Russia at all, but the country in recent years is the oldest democracy so founded. America, which is too small and too unstable quantity to be an international segment, but so many of these small nations among all these wares, some of them drawn within the solid and effective Slavic style, become quite good articles for America and are sold at prices which are a bargain.

That such the national prestige and power today of Russia and the recent popularity of many Mexican products, from glassware to Spanish articles, makes it quite clear that they want and do not care as to what country it comes from, or what system of government furnished it.

Tuning In On Moscow

Seven Germans were sentenced to prison the other day for listening to a Moscow radio station. All of them having their sentences deferred for two years on the additional offense of discussing political developments and public questions with their neighbors. On the other hand, the Germans pay in Radio to Moscow, it might be that "Uncle Joe" as his intimate admirers call him, cannot be at his best. So at this time, having been quoted during his interaction as the senior political authority, Mr. Stalin makes a remark or two and sometimes an ex-Gov. Ely doesn't see the new deal quite so big. if in 1936 and just doesn't want to talk about it anyway. Perhaps his silence can be explained in all three ways.

An American mining engineer who lately visited Eritrea says that Mussolini's 3 trains worked very comfortably. Ethiopia, he notes, does not control the trade of the hunting frontiers in the West? Why not with an army large in numbers for a change? But a mining boom is based on solid hopes from the surface of the on wealth due from the pockets of businessmen by Ms. Nance.

Shortwave amateurs had a wonderful spring telling about radio from Germany and that they listened to broadcasts that are limited to broadcasting notes on the weather in different parts of the country, and an exciting event at midnight of which the sleeping world has not yet been told keeps the set buzzing for hours.

It is suggested in a dispatch from Washington that Secretary of Agriculture May's be time laid the government to lay its embargo on domestic cotton, making the domestic market share, that is not a very invisible burden of taxation in the half.

Italy sympathizes with the British who are forced to hold an election of some kind in Spain, but at Great Britain sympathizes with the Italian who never have a practice election. No try to country is a position by itself, for the sins of other and country.

Montana may or may not be deserted by being told that big mountains in the course may be the gains of its mountains. For all practical purposes its mountains are already high enough.
