ALICE STONE BLACKWELL

ALICE STONE BLACKWELL, more than any other living person, symbolizes the whole range of the struggle of women through two generations to win untrammeled human status. One of her aunts was the first woman in the world to obtain a medical degree and another aunt was the first to be ordained a minister. Her mother, Lucy Stone, was the first Massachusetts woman to go to college; became the first woman to keep her name after marriage when the injustice to women embodied in law and custom was more public speaking by women was hardly respectable; and she achieved the hall-dozen great national figures in the woman's movement. Her father gave a lifetime of service to the woman's cause.

The life of the daughter was inextricably interwoven from babyhood in the widely varied activities of her parents, which Miss Blackwell has recorded in her book "Lucy Stone, Pioneer of Woman's Rights". She was Assistant Editor of the Woman's Journal for thirty-five years; Secretary of the National American Woman Suffrage Association for twenty years; and President of the New England and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Associations. As Miss Blackwell's chief weapon was the pen, often anonymous, she was not personally in the public eye as much as the platform campaigners, but she was probably equally important for planning and writing for that paper as well as innumerable leaflets, articles, newspaper letters and speeches. She supplied the movement with much of its basic foundation of information, keen analysis and argument. Among journalists she was regarded as an editor of outstanding ability. In the council chamber she applied her rich wisdom, vast information, fertile mind and dauntless spirit to innumerable problems. She held through the years carried the suffrage cause step by step to final victory.

When success was won she lost no time addressing herself to the task of educating and organizing the new voters for public-spirited citizenship. She became Honorary Chairman and an active board member of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.

In line with her family's pioneering interest in the field of women's education she has served Boston University, her alma mater, as a trustee since 1907.

Throughout these long years her sensitive humanity has made her responsive to countless other struggles against oppression. Roused by the Armenian massacres of the '90s, she became a lifelong champion of that people. Later she undertook varied efforts to win them public understanding and support; she rendered into English verse Armenian religious and other poetry which was recognized by the bestowal of the Order of Melusine.

The atrocious oppression of the Czar's government led her to active work with the American Friends of Russian Freedom. Her warm cooperation and friendship with Mme. Catherine Breshkovsky extended over many years and included the editing of her autobiography and letters.

The struggles of labor have equally enlisted her quick sympathies on countless occasions. Repeatedly she raises her voice against exploitation and the suppression of free speech, of the right to organize and of other civil liberties.

The range of Miss Blackwell's interests led her at one time during many years to turn her talents to its service by promoting cultural appreciation. She rendered into English verse "Songs of Grief and Gladness" (Yiddish), "Songs of Russia", the Hungarian poems of Petöfi and "Some Spanish-American Poets", — the latter a monumental volume of over two hundred poems, opening to North Americans a new continent of literature. This work she still continues.

Not without justification was Miss Blackwell chosen last year to receive the annual medal given by the Ford Hall Forum to that citizen of Greater Boston who has made the most notable contribution to the public weal. Now at seventy-seven years of age, frail of body but untouched in mind by the years, she continues her work with the zeal and enthusiasm of her eternally youthful spirit. Her tireless pen stands ever ready to aid the quest of freedom wherever and in whatever form it calls to her for help.
