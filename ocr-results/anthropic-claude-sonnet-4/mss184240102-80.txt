Friday Mar 8

My dear Friend.
        Yours from Ithaca
I sent to [crossed out text] because I
understood you were to
be there at just that time
but I could not have
met you. I was with
& Dr Van Meter & I was very
much disappointed too
but so glad you & Mother
enjoyed yourself so well.
& what a fine old care penny
self for what future is in
hopes. but Mrs Seelkie feels
sure if it was one long summer
