In Virginia quite an amount of land was libelled and about to be sold by the marshal just previous to the establishment of the bureau, when the sales were suspended by the Secretary of War, in order that these lands might be turned over to the bureau for the benefit of the freedmen. I claimed that these lands, which had been condemned to sale, though not actually sold, were already the property of the government, and objected to his excellency the President against the insertion of the word "sold" in the first definition of confiscated property. The President referred the matter to the Attorney General, whereupon, finally, the word "sold" was inserted.

This decision necessitated the restoration of all the property where the sale had been suspended. I have been very desirous of conforming to the letter of the law in setting apart lands, but was unwilling to do so before it became probable that they could be retained.
