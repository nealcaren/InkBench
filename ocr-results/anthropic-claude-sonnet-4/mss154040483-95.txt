"Party Clean-ups Are
the Crying Need"

Says

Carrie Chapman Catt

Distinguished Suffrage Leader

Mrs. Catt

WANTED, feminism in politics. Emily Newell Blair says so. Mrs. Blair, sunny-tempered, broad-visioned and keen, is one time hopeful, confesses herself (in her recent Journal article) to be pessimistic on the subject of women in politics. Her conclusions are drawn from seven years' experience and hard work as vice-chairman of the National Democratic Committee.

She admits that women vote at conventions and serve on committees but says that they act as "ladies" in their own ideas and policies, she charges that they have been widely guilty of merely doing what men want them to do and of voting as men direct them.

Mrs. Blair finds that women have started no progressive action on their own initiative and that the "hope" of political power.

Perhaps. But there is a twin comment and one should not be made without the other. The masses of men, also, had to support independently their own ideas and policies and they walk up to the chalk mark and have been bright lights on tell them to; in fact, men and women behave so much alike in politics that the comment should be confined to the admission that the great masses of men and women have never quite got the power and are more or less in leading strings.

No American woman in high political leadership has been known to express views so similar to Mrs. Blair's as to reveal the fact that the same old thing

that has happened in one party has also occurred in the other.

Mrs. Blair suggests that the remedy is the application of more feminism. I believe that also. But she differs from party and, said Mrs. Blair says there are certain methods by which women must become a power in politics and such power she regards as essential. One is by holding office and the other is by becoming effective in political organization. Either or both calls for more feminism.

But is the feminism a revival of something we once had or is it a brand-new attitude for which modern politics is yearning? Personally, while I agree with Mrs. Blair in many of her comments, I do not think her diagnosis is correct.

THE fact is that when the new women voters walked through the opened door into American politics there was not great crying need through the country demanding a thoroughgoing party cleaning. The parties have become defamed and, apparently, are as much in need of it as on the day women were enfranchised.

Said Professor McMaster, of the University of Pennsylvania, under the title, "The Political Depravity of the Fathers:"

"A very little study of long forgotten politics will suffice to show that in filibustering and gerrymandering, in stealing governorships and legislatures, in using force at the polls, in colonizing and

in distributing patronage to whom patronage is due, in all the frauds and tricks that go to make up the worst form of practical politics, the men who shaped our local and national governments were always our equals and often our masters."

SO the years passed. Votes were bought, nominations were engineered, legislation was passed or lost as best served the party until women entered into politics, poor men made fortunes in politics, and the price of election has flown so high that it must withstand continual investigation.

There is a Tammany Hall in New York, a Republican machine in Chicago, and a Republican machine, even worse. Neither men nor women have seriously attempted to remove the dishonorable use of money, corruption, fraud and indecent attempts to cover up the wicked things that have been done.

No feminism in politics and no masculinity in politics has contributed much to American self-government although the nation drops down, on every other question and devote themselves to the instruction of honesty and decency in the administration of party politics. We shall never be a great nation, and we shall certainly never be worthy of the respect of our own citizens and their neighbors, until this housecleaning is thoroughly done. Every dishonest trick, every over-expenditure,

every purchased office, must be reorganized by men and women, and political honesty must be made the common standard of all parties before any simple remedy can be applied effectively.

The women from women of all parties is that they will no longer support a party that is dishonest or one that permits profit to certain of its men, would startle the nation and the world; it would awaken respect where it does not now exist. It would put the right kind of men and women into politics and take out the wrong kind of masculinity. Instead of more women effectively working in the parties, the great need is a crusade conducted by men and women against the practice and tolerance of their parties.

In short, Mrs. Blair and her friends, a Republican and her friends, consider how to answer three questions: Are women getting out of politics all they should?
Are women giving to politics all that they might?
Is there a demand for more feminism, less masculinity, or more decency? When the crusade is completed there will be need of another Round Table to answer the next question.
How shall the result wanted be attained?
