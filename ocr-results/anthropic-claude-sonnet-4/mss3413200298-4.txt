Dear Mrs. Brown:
I can't tell you how much about
Mrs. Blackwell I or unanswered, even
if the chance I need like to send
must be omitted.
I have always admired Mrs Blackwell,
and, in later years, have loved her
especially. Her always beautiful Christ-
mas and Easter messages, and her
indomitable spiritual grace are such
lonely additions to the great back-
ground of her life work.
It wrings my heart to know that
she, too, is facing a financial vacuum.
There are so many who are! I am one
of them myself, so of course I would
share in making the fund which you
are raising. Being a starving artist
is a most painful handicap,
in every way, but it is particularly
hard to endure, when appeals like
this come.
Thanks you for including me
as one of her friends, - which
I most heartily am.

Sincerely,
Mary Ware Dennett
