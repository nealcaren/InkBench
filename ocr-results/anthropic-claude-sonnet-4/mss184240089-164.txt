if you will but keep
the eye of your own
spirit turned inward -
for it is [from] within
(not without) that the
the precious jewel of
truth & light is to
be sought & found -
And seeking - you
will find it, & think
if one has it - and
all men & women will
call you blessed -
hastily but oh so dearly

Susan P. Wharton
